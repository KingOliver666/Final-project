    "Razer's new 2025 lineup of gaming laptops are now up for preorder. TheRazer Blade 16andRazer Blade 18can now be ordered directly from Razer.com and will be equipped with the upcoming Intel and Ryzen processors (depending on which display size you get) as well as the anticipated RTX 5000-series mobile GPUs in three variants: RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080, and RTX 5090. Preordering will also get you some bonus accessories depending on the model.\n",

    "Razer Blade laptops are well known for their impeccable build quality. The chassis is built from a single piece of aluminum and is designed to be exceptionally thin and light for a gaming laptop. In order to get away with the svelte form factor, Razer employs its own proprietary cooling design which incorporates a vacuum sealed, liquid filled, copper vapor chamber to effectively whisk away the heat. Much like Apple MacBook Pros, a lot of engineering goes into a Razer Blade laptop, which is why they command a premium price compared to other mainstream brands.\n",
    "The Razer Blade 18 is an Intel-based system and the base config is equipped with the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, which is a more performance-minded chip compared to the current Core Ultra 9 185H, which focuses on efficiency. The rest of the specs include an 18\" Dual UHD+ 240Hz display (which can natively switch to FHD+ 440Hz), RTX 5070 Ti graphics, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $3,499.99. You can upgrade to either the RTX 5080 or the RTX 5090.\n",

    "Our benchmarks are in, and it looks like the RTX 5090 is indeed the new king of mobile GPUs, although not by the leaps and bounds we were hoping for. On average, the RTX 5090 is about 5%-10% more powerful than the RTX 4090 that it replaces. However, add in DLSS 4 and the gap widens.\n",

    "\"If you already have a decent gaming laptop, you really shouldn’t look at the RTX 5090 twice. It doesn’t deliver much of an improvement over its last-generation counterpart, which remains excellent. However, if you’ve been waiting to upgrade to a high-end gaming laptop for a while, features like multi-frame generation and battery boost will make premium laptops powered by Nvidia’s latest even better.\"\n",
    "Dell announced the return of the venerable Alienware Area-51 gaming laptop back in CES 2025, and starting today it is finally available to order. It comes in two size variants: the16\" model starts at $3,199.99and the18\" model starts at $3,399.99. As expected from Alienware's new flagship laptop, the Area-51 is equipped with current generation components, including the latest and greatest Intel Core Ultra 9 CPU and NVIDIA Blackwell GPU.
