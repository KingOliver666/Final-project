"Razer's new 2025 lineup of gaming laptops are now up for preorder. TheRazer Blade 16andRazer Blade 18can now be ordered directly from Razer.com and will be equipped with the upcoming Intel and Ryzen processors (depending on which display size you get) as well as the anticipated RTX 5000-series mobile GPUs in three variants: RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080, and RTX 5090. Preordering will also get you some bonus accessories depending on the model.

Razer Blade laptops are well known for their impeccable build quality. The chassis is built from a single piece of aluminum and is designed to be exceptionally thin and light for a gaming laptop. In order to get away with the svelte form factor, Razer employs its own proprietary cooling design which incorporates a vacuum sealed, liquid filled, copper vapor chamber to effectively whisk away the heat. Much like Apple MacBook Pros, a lot of engineering goes into a Razer Blade laptop, which is why they command a premium price compared to other mainstream brands.
The Razer Blade 18 is an Intel-based system and the base config is equipped with the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, which is a more performance-minded chip compared to the current Core Ultra 9 185H, which focuses on efficiency. The rest of the specs include an 18"" Dual UHD+ 240Hz display (which can natively switch to FHD+ 440Hz), RTX 5070 Ti graphics, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $3,499.99. You can upgrade to either the RTX 5080 or the RTX 5090.
Preordering the Razer Blade 16 will also get you an X-Ray Razer laptop skin and a USB-C dock.
The Razer Blade 16 is a Ryzen system and the base config is equipped with an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU. The rest of the specs include a 16"" 240Hz QHD+ OLED display, RTX 5070 Ti graphics, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $2,999.99. The processor can be upgraded to a Ryzen AI 9 370HX, and the GPU can be upgraded to either the RTX 5080 or  RTX 5090.
Preordering the Razer Blade 18 will get youan X-Ray Razer laptop skin and RGB laptop stand.
Razer has listed an expected ship date ofApril 30on the product pages.
Our benchmarks are in, and it looks like the RTX 5090 is indeed the new king of mobile GPUs, although not by the leaps and bounds we were hoping for. On average, the RTX 5090 is about 5%-10% more powerful than the RTX 4090 that it replaces. However, add in DLSS 4 and the gap widens.
RTX 5090 Mobile Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas
""If you already have a decent gaming laptop, you really shouldn’t look at the RTX 5090 twice. It doesn’t deliver much of an improvement over its last-generation counterpart, which remains excellent. However, if you’ve been waiting to upgrade to a high-end gaming laptop for a while, features like multi-frame generation and battery boost will make premium laptops powered by Nvidia’s latest even better.""
Dell announced the return of the venerable Alienware Area-51 gaming laptop back in CES 2025, and starting today it is finally available to order. It comes in two size variants: the16"" model starts at $3,199.99and the18"" model starts at $3,399.99. As expected from Alienware's new flagship laptop, the Area-51 is equipped with current generation components, including the latest and greatest Intel Core Ultra 9 CPU and NVIDIA Blackwell GPU. Orders are expected to ship out starting April 30, so get your reservation in now to prevent any additional delays.

"Several new features are tied to a phone app
byTyler Colp
On top of the improved graphical performance for theSwitch 2 versions ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom, there will be a suite of new features in the Nintendo Switch phone app, including an achievement system and, strangely, a voice navigation assistant.
The new service inside the Switch app is called Zelda Notes. It only works for theSwitch 2versions, and is “designed to provide a more streamlined gameplay experience,” according to theoverview trailer.
The app has achievement-like medals you can earn for doing things like traveling long distances, defeating enemies, collecting rupees, and other metrics. Medals are tracked globally and you can view what other players have earned compared to yourself in the app, too.
All I can say is that it’s a very Nintendo move to add achievements to only two Switch 2 games that exist solely on a service inside of an app. You could speculate on whether this means Nintendo is gearing up to finally make its own version of achievements in the year 2025, but we all know within ourselves that this is probably a weird one-off thing we’ll never see again.
Another major feature of Zelda Notes is voice navigation, which looks a lot like a GPS assistant that can tell you where to find things like Koroks, Skyview Towers, Shrines, and more. In the short demo, a player selects a map icon on their phone and the voice calls out directions to a Korok hidden under a rock inTears of the Kingdom.
To me, it’s an odd feature to include for two open-world games about the joys of exploring and discovering things. There’s no shame in using guides when you’re stumped, but I’m not sure these games would be as much fun if you spent the entire time being told where to go. It makes more sense to use it for finding something in a pinch or cleaning up what you missed. Honestly, I’m having trouble trying to think of who Nintendo thinks this is for.
One of the things you can use the navigation assistant to find are a bunch of new voice memories from Zelda, King Rauru, and Master Kohga. These short audio diaries are scattered around the world and let you hear the characters’ thoughts on locations and moments in Hyrule’s history. All the Zelda lore heads out there will have a new reason to boot up their old save files.
The app also lets you share blueprints for yourTears of the Kingdombuilds — a feature that would’ve been nice two years ago — as well as gift items to other players, edit screenshots, roll for small daily in-game bonuses, and get rewards for scanning amiibo.
The Zelda Notes service will go live inside the Nintendo Switch app on June 5, the same daythe Switch 2 launches, along with the upgraded versions ofBreath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom.

"Apparently Donkey Kong is basically the Hulk
byRuss Frushtick
While watching the bigNintendo Switch 2 Direct, I’m sure I wasn’t alone in expecting the long-awaited follow-up toSuper Mario Odyssey. When the final trailer kicked off with lush, cartoony environs, it seemed clear that the expectation was about to become reality. But nope, Nintendo’s big surprise game was actuallyDonkey Kong Bananza, a new 3D adventure game starring the king of the Kongs.
But is this just a palette swap? Maybe the developers wanted to make a new 3D platformer, but to mix it up they slotted in Donkey Kong instead of Mario. Effectively, is this the sequel toMario Odysseywe’ve been waiting for?
Big time not.
After having spent 30 minutes playing the game at Nintendo’s press event Wednesday, I can say thatDonkey Kong Bananzamight be the most “fuck everything up” game Nintendo has ever made. Seconds into controlling Donkey Kong, I was set loose in a mine staffed by very sad chimpanzees. And no, I wasn’t there to save them. Apparently this next generation of DK is very obsessed with Bananium, a mineral that looks a heck of a lot like gold and I guess tastes like bananas.
The gameplay consists of Donkey Kong just sprinting through the mine breaking literally everything around him. He’s busting holes in walls, he’s throwing huge boulders — he’s a very mobile, very hungry wrecking ball. There was very little platforming involved, in fact, with much more of a focus on wrecking shit. Every button and trigger but one results in some wrecking-shit variant. There’s the standard horizontal punch, there’s a ground slam, there’s a ground drum (for sending nearby pickups into the air for collection), there’s a grab and throw for hurling boulders. You are just marching around the environments fucking shit up.
This can feel a bit chaotic — and actually resulted in some motion sickness, requiring me to turn down some of the sensitivity settings — but it was a blast. The meditative platforming you might find in a Mario game has been replaced by something entirely different, and entirely in line with Donkey Kong’s persona. Dude loves bananas and wrecking shit.
The game does have some purpose to it. Sometimes you are given mini objectives to keep things moving, like using exploding boulders to open up new pathways. And there are a ton of collectibles hidden within the walls and underground to uncover. The levels appear to be quite large and seemingly filled with a number of different paths you can go down, makingBananzafeel much more in line with what you’d expect from a major first-party Nintendo release. But all of that felt secondary to the pure joy of destroying the world around me.
I cleared out a particularly gold-filled area, only to look back on the chaos I had wrought. It was like a tornado had whipped through the heart of the mine, and no one was spared.

"A Minecraft Movie immediately creates a sticky paradox for itself. Clearly hoping to follow in the footsteps of a project likeThe Lego Movie, this video-game adaptation wants to pay tribute to the open-world flexibility and creativity ofMinecraftwhile staying well within the framework of the game itself, which means including all of the expected blocky visual touchstones and including an obligatory number of cutesy gamer in-jokes. The surprise of the movie is how long it’s able to delay the latter material – long enough, it turns out, forNapoleon Dynamitedirector Jared Hess to get his foot in the door, expertly adapting his deadpan comic-strip style for a children’s fantasy.

Hess’ foray into big-time franchise filmmaking reunites him with Jack Black, the star of his 2006 slapstick adventure,Nacho Libre– and no one can accuse Black of half-assing his way through a paycheck job here. As Steve, a man who “yearned for the mines” as a child and discovers a portal into the magical Overworld as an adult, he throws off the shackles of workaday existence with such relish that his torrent of movie-opening narration feels enthusiastic, rather than blandly explanatory. The short of it: Bad-guy pigs covet the “orb” (like everything else in the Overworld, it’s block-shaped, not an actual orb) that Steve has discovered, so he sends his faithfulwolf-dog, Dennis, to hide it in the real world.
Hess really connects with his Dynamite roots – throwback fashions, drier-than-dry non sequitur – and setting in that real world, where he pauses Steve’s story to follow siblings Natalie (Emma Myers, fromWednesday) and Henry (Sebastian Hansen) as they relocate to a small town in Idaho. There, creative, school-age misfit Henry clicks with Garrett Garrison (Jason Momoa), a former gaming champion who now runs a retro pop-culture junk store on the verge of foreclosure. Natalie, meanwhile, meets Dawn (Danielle Brooks), a friendly real estate agent who moonlights as a kind of mobile zookeeper.
In a movie for grown-ups, this litany of quirk might seem a bit much: Natalie is a young woman of indeterminate age who gets a job running social media for a local potato-chip factory; Henry tinkers with his design for a working jetpack. For a kid picture, though, it’s sweetly silly, even distinctive; the kitschy tater-tots-and-alpacas ambience is pure Hess. Momoa in particular makes a surprisingly good fit for the filmmaker’s sensibility, playing a less bullying version of the blustery Napoleon Dynamite sensei Rex Kwon Do. In fact, the first 30 to 40 minutes of A Minecraft Movie have enough big laughs that it’s almost a disappointment when Henry, Garrett, Natalie, and Dawn stumble upon the orb and wind up accidentally sucked into the Overworld.
Eventually they meet up with Steve, who provides some standard gameplay tutelage in advance of their quest. The quest itself is conceptually muddy, confusingly and erratically presented as some combination of saving Steve’s beloved Dennis, protecting the orb, and eventually bringing the four displaced travelers home. The seams of the six-writer screenplay show frequently, like when characters make plans and then deviate from them without comment as if the actors are all working from different versions of the script. Based on the uninspired action sequences – digital hordes running and flying around in a manner better suited for an in-gameLord of the Ringsfan film – there aren't many big-budget fantasy epics in Hess' future. But A Minecraft Movie stays light on its feet nonetheless by continually pausing for slapstick silliness and cartoonish little sketches like an ongoing and delightfully pointless subplot involving Jennifer Coolidge and a resident of the Overworld.
Eventually, the more antic side of things takes over, and the various CG landscapes populated by blocky people and creatures start to feel repetitive. It’s like a slightly more polished version of someone’s playthrough video, only with a couple of big stars getting thrown around the screen. What A Minecraft Movie misses from Minecraft the game is its combination of minutiae and vastness; as much as the movie advertises its subject’s creative flexibility, it shortchanges any potential obsessiveness in favor of making the Overworld look a little more like something out of aMariogame. The parallelsto Black’s other video-game-movie gig– and aspirations to its popularity with the playground set – become especially clear when Steve chases the next “Peaches” by riffing out no fewer than three little songs. (On the other hand, it’s hard to resist Black bringing his goofball-rock-star shtick to Gen Alpha.) As with so many game-based movies, the mismatch between what each medium does best isn’t really reconciled by A Minecraft Movie. But turning the world’s best-selling video game into Jared Hess’s best feature in years is, admittedly, a pretty creative undertaking.
For a big-studio adaptation of a massively popular video-game, A Minecraft Movie lets a surprising amount of its director’s personality shine through. Napoleon Dynamite’s Jared Hess manages to fit some laugh-out-loud silliness into his Overworld saga before surrendering to the obligations of CG-driven fantasy adventure. Thematically, A Minecraft Movie offers a pat world-is-what-you-make-it lesson, but Jack Black and Jason Momoa in particular sell it with a lot of comic enthusiasm.",846,"Jack Black stars as Steve, a man who “yearned for the mines” as a child and discovers a portal into the magical Overworld as an adult.

"If you're in the market for a new PlayStation or Xbox console and bottom-line pricing is your utmost priority, check out these deals from AliExpress. You can get a brand new importedXbox Series XandPlayStation 5consoles for much lower than you can find a new model elsewhere. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming consoles that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by your account, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item. These consoles all ship locally from the United States and usually arrive within one week.

AliExpress as a whole is a legitimate website, but since it is a marketplace comprised of individual sellers, you have to make sure that the vendor you're buying from is reputable. In many cases, the easiest way to do so is to look at the seller's rating and history. In terms of the products we've listed in this article, while it's true that some of the sellers may not have many reviews,AliExpress has reached out to us and personally vetted these vendors, which is why we feel comfortable promoting them. AliExpress also offers a 15 to 90 day free return policy depending on the product.
AliExpress has dropped the price of the professional-grade Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Controller to only $74.42 shipped after you apply coupon code ""IFP3TXY""in cart. That's a huge price drop from its normal $140 list price and nearly the same cost as a standard Xbox controller. Note that this is a Hong Kong or Japanese import model in new retail packaging, but you won't find it cheaper anywhere else. Aside from the different color scheme, the Core controller is identical to the Xbox Elite Series 2 non-Core controller. The Core controller, however, does not include the component pack. AliExpress offers a 90-day return policy.
AliExpress also just dropped the price on a new retail boxed (imported) Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 wireless gaming controller – component pack included – to $100 shipped. This controller retails for $180 and the lowest price we've ever seen for this controller stateside is about $130-$140.
Lenovo has dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart. Lenovo might not be the first site you'd think of for great deals on PlayStation controllers, but surprisingly, no one can match their pricing. This might be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, at least untilSony's PlayStation Days of Play Salethat will probably happen sometime in late May.
SteelSeries is currently offering theArctis Nova 7 Dragon Editiongaming headset for only $119.99 after an $80 off instant discount. The Dragon Edition is identical to the Nova Arctis 7 in build quality and performance, but with the addition of a deep red colorway with decorative gold dragon accents in celebration of 2024's Year of the Dragon motif. Even though 2024 has passed, this is still one of SteelSeries' classier designs that doesn't feel outdated or out of place.
SteelSeries is also taking 35% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets. The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Destiny 2 in-game items.

"Most devices don’t support PCIe 5.0, narrowing this SSD’s appeal
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
PlayStation 5andPS5 Proowners, as well as most PC users, don’t need to get worked up about PCIe 5.0 SSDs. Sure, they boastmuchfaster advertised speeds than PS5-ready PCIe 4.0 models, which are reasonably affordable these days — 2 TB costs around $150— and come in different storage configurations and styles. But, most mainstream gaming devices and PCs aren’t built to take advantage of PCIe 5.0 speeds. The ones thatarecompatible haven’t given me enough reasons to get jealous … yet.
I say this as someone who has the new Samsung 9100 Pro in-hand (out today), but can’t actually take full advantage of its ludicrous speeds. My newly-rebuilt PC supports PCIe 5.0 SSDs, but there are other bottlenecks in my system (such as the PCIe 3.0 SSDs I use for game installs and the OS) that would provide an imperfect view of the 9100 Pro’s performance. While I love tofind excusesto upgrade my PC, testing videos I’ve seen indicate that the PCIe 5.0 storage isn’t worth overhauling my system for.
As seen from thisvideofrom the YouTube channel Testing Games that shows PC game loading times with PCIe 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 SSDs next to each other, the results aren’t a night-and-day difference in the newer tech’s favor. We’re talking one to three seconds in terms of loading speed, depending on the game (sometimes more, sometimes less). This2024 video from Linus Tech Tipsshows scenarios in which PCIe 5.0 is merely on par with PCIe 4.0 in PCs (and in some rare cases, slightly behind). Regardless, it’s important to note that neither of the testing videos above include Samsung’s new 9100 Pro, so it’s not fair to assume its performance without having put it through its paces. I look forward to seeing if this one changes the narrative.
To put the 9100 Pro’s speed improvements in context, it’s fun to compare it to Samsung’s first PCIe 4.0 SSD,the 980 Pro. Samsung’s new 9110 Pro doubles the 980 Pro’s sequential read speed (14,800 MB/s vs. 7,000 MB/s) and nearly triples its sequential write speed (13,400 MB/s vs. 5,000 MB/s). Sequential gains are nice, but since most workloads (and games) access data randomly, random read /write speeds are more important to consider. Those are improved in the 9100 Pro, too, even when compared to the last-gen 990 Pro. The $219.99 (1 TB with heatsink) starting price makes sense given the speed increases, though it’s astronomical in price compared to the 990 Pro, which currently costs $179.99 at Amazon for the2 TB heatsink model.
It’s unclear as to whether Samsung is done making improved versions of PCIe 4.0-based SSDs, since the990 Pro approached the theoretical speed limit. But if you’re questioning whether you should get a Samsung 990 Pro or any other competing PCIe 4.0 SSD with comparable read / write speeds, I’d suggest following your budget.
If you have a large budget, it’s not completely (only slightly) unreasonable to buy the 9100 Pro if you plan to eventually upgrade to a PCIe 5.0 system down the line. This and all PCIe 5.0 SSDs are backwards compatible in PCIe 4.0 hardware, including the PS5, albeit with slower data transfer speeds than advertised. Therearetangible benefits to having faster storage when it comes to moving data around (assuming your hardware can take full advantage of it), but even so, it doesn’t usually improve gameplay as much as a new graphics card and processor upgrade can. If you play online multiplayer games primarily, those won’t be a great showcase of the 9100 Pro’s prowess as you’ll load into the game at the same speed as everyone else.

"﻿Want some tea?
byNicole Carpenter
A few years ago, a sound bite went viral on TikTok: “Darling, I’ve told you several times before, I have no dream job. I do not dream of labor.”As writer Caitlyn Clark put it in Jacobin at the time, it’s no surprise that the statement resonated with people: a “tighter labor market,” Clark wrote, put increased pressure on workers over the past several years. It’s an increased strain that’s put more and more money in the pockets of the richest among us, yet it hasn’t created better workplaces or a better world for the rest of us. And I’ve been thinking about this phrase — “I do not dream of labor” — as I play developer Ivy Road’sWanderstop. Though the foot on protagonist Alta’s neck is not one of a corporation, but of an individual drive to succeed at all costs — certainly influenced by culture at large — she is ultimately worn down so severely that she can no longer continue. She’s forced to rest, to engage in a less laborious life. But her new life does, indeed, involve labor.
Wanderstopbegins with prolific and successful fighter Alta failing. It’s her first major failure — something she vowed would never happen to her. She had gone to a forest in search of a woman who can train her up, bring her back to her peak form, but the journey didn’t go as planned. Where she lands, instead, is a tea shop. The affable tea shop owner, Boro, plucked her from the forest after she collapsed, no longer able to wield her sword. She doesn’t want to stay, but she also can’t leave: Every time she tries, she collapses. She can’t hold her sword. And so, she does stay. People start to trickle into the tea shop and its surrounding clearing, so she makes them tea.
At this point, Alta probably does dream of labor — the labor of training and fighting for redemption. But over the course of roughly a dozen hours, she begins to let go of that compulsion. Alta trades one type of labor for another: one that’s more caring, slow, and, yes, healing.Wanderstop’s tea shop does not operate for profit. The land around the shop provides everything necessary to make a cup of tea, aside from the tea-making contraption itself. This is whereWanderstoppulls in its cozy gaming elements — the comforting repetition of a farming simulator, with a little twist, is the backbone of its gameplay. Working as Alta, I must plant seeds in specific formations to produce different sorts of plants to harvest both seeds and fruits; the seeds keep the farming running, and the fruits I use to brew tea. I explore the forest for tea leaves, sweep up piles of dead greenery, and snip invasive vines. The tea leaves get dried, and then I can make tea for the different people who pass by.
Each of these people stays briefly at the tea shop, their own stories playing out with every interaction. At first, Alta is desperate for labor — begging people to let her make them tea. But that attitude shifts with each cup of tea she makes as she grapples with her dark past, something she’s long blocked out. Her new form of labor, the act of foraging for ingredients, growing essential fruits, and brewing tea to serve to others, is what’s healing her; she’s engaging in her community in a useful, thoughtful way. Her labor makes a difference not only for herself, but for others, too. Separated from an exploitative system, her work means something more. Beyond the narrative,Wanderstoplargely succeeds at engaging with this ideology through its gameplay. I’m not necessarily rewarded in any way for brewing tea for people in the clearing, other than learning their own stories and preferences. This doesn’t unlock tools to do the job better or faster; I brew tea the same, complicated way each time, using a big ol’ contraption that requires several steps of manual labor.
There’s no real time limit on appeasing these customers; they’ll stay for as long as necessary to get their cup of tea. If you wanted, instead, to brew a dozen cups for yourself or Boro, that’s quite all right. Maybe you’d rather play around with decorations, or test out new combinations of patterns to grow other plants. That’s OK, too. ButWanderstopis a game, and there are still plenty of game-y elements that do detract from its themes. It’s pretty aggressive with its notification icons, for one, so it’s always immediately clear that there’s a new customer to serve or something another wants to tell you. For instance, there’s an early character who’s an eager knight placed under a curse. After one interaction, he sets back out into the forest to complete some task — but in my playthrough, he returned not even a minute later ready to push his own story further, a big yellow exclamation mark over his head as he rushed back toward me. The urgency of these sorts of interactions is entirely at odds with everything else in the game. There’s a meaningful friction in the narrative that makesWanderstopmemorable, but that friction isn’t replicated in the slightest with the gameplay. I can understand why, because adding that friction, be it simply through more time spent waiting or removing notification icons, risks players becoming frustrated and quitting. But it’s a friction that the game could have benefited from to better serveWanderstop’s unique framing.
This all comes back to the idea of dreaming about labor — or not. I don’t dream of labor within the system we live under now, but that doesn’t mean I don’t dream about labor at all. The future I dream of isn’t one without friction, but one that ensures a slower, happier life for my community, even if that means doing the work.Wanderstopfeels the most meaningful when it focuses on that.

"Fans quick to celebrate the reveal of a Microsoft Flight Simulator PlayStation Store page were left let down after it was discovered that the actual product is little more than “copycat shovelware.”

Xbox and PlayStation fans gathered to discuss a potential port for the popular flight simulation game afterReddit user CreativeRaspberry314 sharedTrophy information related to a potential PS4 and PS5 version earlier today. It would be exciting – ifnot somewhat unsurprising– to see Microsoft bring more Xbox titles to PlayStation fans, butthe spotted store pageisn’t officially related to Microsoft Flight Simulator in any way, shape, or form.
“Sadly, this is just a copycat shovelware game,” oneReddit user added. “Straight up shovelware,” anotheradded. “Actually mental tbh, the picture is a straight up rip-off. If it was MSFS, it'd have the same achievements as the Xbox/Steam versions.”
Instead, the Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation is being published by a company named Grizzly Games Limited. As spotted byEurogamer, the company shares a name with Thronefall developer Grizzly Games but is also completely unrelated to that entity. While that team is responsible for other titles like Superflight and Islanders, theGrizzly Games Limited websitereveals a catalog of what appear to be mobile games featuring glossy, AI-generated materials. The art for its Flight Simulator 2025 project also appears to be generated by AI judging by some of its muddy plane parts and strange designs.
The Thronefall team, meanwhile, provided a statement to Eurogamer related to the discovery of Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation and Grizzly Games Limited. Grizzly Games says it is not associated with the company, adding that it is using “both our name and logo illegally.”
“Furthermore they seem to incorporate the absolute opposite of our values, of what we stand for and what we’re trying to give to the gaming community,” Grizzly Games continued. “Unfortunately our legal resources are limited as a two-person indie team, but honestly I'd love to see this kind of stuff being stopped, especially since it's not only happening to us but lots of indie devs that just lack the legal power.""
As of this story’s publication, the Flight Simulator 2025 page remains live on the PlayStation Store. It describes an experience that “sets a new standard in aviation simulation, combining ultra-realistic flight dynamics with breathtaking visuals.” No gameplay for the project has been revealed.
“Can shovelware just be banned from the store please? It’s packed to the brim with it and makes browsing an absolute chore,” anotherReddit user added. “I don’t remember it being this bad in prior generations.”
PlayStationtook a standagainst what many refer to as “spam” titles in 2022. At the time, it was believed the move was made to fight back against easy-to-Platinum games, or titles that exist almost solely for the purpose of increasing players’ Platinum Trophy count. However, many shovelware titles still exist on the PlayStation Store andother digital storefrontstoday.
Webrought a magnifying glass up to the issue last monthto take a closer look at how shovelware titles impact both gamers and developers. We spoke to multiple developers to learn more about not only how these games find their way onto digital storefronts but PlayStation, Nintendo, Xbox, and Valve’s vetting process.

"Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition has hit its lowest price yet,now available for $49.99 at Amazon—its best deal to date, even beating Black Friday, according to our records, and even price-tracking siteCamelCamelCamel.

Originally released on October 8 forNintendo SwitchandPlayStation 4 (fully compatible with PS5), this collection brings together the first six mainline Final Fantasy games in their carefully remastered form. Square Enix has opted for refinement rather than reinvention, keeping the original pixelated aesthetic intact but sharpening it for modern displays.
The result is a collection that looks fantastic, whether on a massive TV or in handheld mode. The soundtrack has also received an orchestral upgrade, with legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu overseeing the new arrangements. On top of that, the package introduces a handful of thoughtful quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to disable random encounters and boost experience and gil gains—useful for those who want to focus on the story without the grind.
As a small but nostalgic extra, this edition includes a sticker sheet featuring 12 classic character sprites, including the Black Mage, a Moogle, Terra, Kain, and a mid-cackle Kefka. It’s not the most extravagant of bonuses, but it’s a fun little touch for fans of the series.
At its original $74.99 price, the collection was a tougher sell, but at $49.99, it's a much easier recommendation for anyone interested in the series’ origins. Whether you’re revisiting these classics or playing them for the first time, this is a well-executed remaster of six of themost influential RPGsever made. And with physical copies being the only collectible edition available, it might be worth picking up before they become harder to find, especially at this time.

"One of the most fun things about movie-making is remembering all of those little things that almost were and could have been. So many things change in pre-production, post-production, and even the actual production itself — and forCaptain America: Brave New World, one of those things was the role Giancarlo Esposito was going to play.

Esposito ultimately played Sidewinder in the film, but was originally approached to play King Cobra. The Breaking Bad legend revealed toEmpirein a recent interview (via Collider) that producer Nate Moore hadoriginally asked him to portray Klaus Voorhees’ alter ego.
""If I'm walking around the neighborhood, African-Americans go, 'What's up, King?' I love it. They call me King, baby! I mean, that's the highest honor,"" Esposito recalled thinking in those early days. ""But as it turned out, there [are other Kings] in the Marvel world, and this was connected to the Serpent Society — they were going back to the comics and trying to figure it out, and Nate said, 'We can give you all the characteristics of King, but we think he should be Sidewinder.' ""
Voorhees appears in the Captain America comics as a former convict who has to contend with a radioactive snake bite after his murder plot to axe colleague Professor Ezekiel Schektor doesn’t quite go as planned, hence the name King Cobra. In his time on the page, he has battled the likes of Mr. Fantastic, Thor, and Daredevil, as well as Cap and Falcon.
That said,the creatives behind Brave New Worldultimately had Esposito play Sidewinder, aka Seth Voelker, an economics professor who gets chemically mutated by the Roxxon Oil Company and becomes a crime boss and the leader of Serpent. Over the years, he’s had major face-offs with Scarlet Witch, The Thing, Triton, and Stingray — but now he’s having one with Cap himself.
""They spoke about creating a character that was really grounded, in a mercenary fashion,” Esposito added, noting that the character was shaped inthe film's robust reshoots. “They wanted to ground the movie when they went back in to do some additional shooting, and their focus now was on this additional character. So it was a bit of a whirlwind for me. I focused myself and I went in there and knocked it out.""
As for the character’s future in the MCU, it seems at least Esposito wants him to stick around. ""I'm hoping to be in this universe a little longer,"" he said.
It’s no secret thatCaptain America: Brave New Worlddidn’t exactly light the world on fire in terms ofcritical response, fan response, or box office. Check out IGN's feature,Captain America: Brave New World’s Real Budget? You’ll Never Know… and This Is Why, to find out more.

"Mortal Kombat 1 developer NetherRealm has revealed a detailed look at T-1000 gameplay, and a look at a new Fatality packed with references to Terminator 2.

In the video, below, we see the T-1000 use various liquid metal abilities to move about the screen, absorb hits, and poke at his enemies. Even shapeshifting sorcerer Shang Tsung praises the T-1000’s abilities during one pre-match trash talk cutscene.
The highlight of the video is the look at one of the T-1000’s Fatalities, which includes three references to Terminator 2. The first is the iconic finger point through the eyeball, the second the arm blade through the mouth, then the elevator door parting, except through the T-1000’s foe’s torso. Its animality sees the T-1000 transform into a K-9 German Shepherd, another reference to Terminator 2. In the film, John Connor's foster parents owned a German Shepherd named Max. The Terminator calls the dog Wolfie to trick the T-1000.
The T-1000 in Mortal Kombat 1 is of course based on the liquid metal-based cybernetic assassin from the 1991 blockbuster Terminator 2: Judgment Day film, and features the voice and likeness of actor Robert Patrick.
Here’s the official blurb on the T-1000 from NetherRealm:
The T-1000 Terminator joins the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on March 18 as part of the early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners, followed by wide availability for purchase on March 25.
Meanwhile, we get another look at the upcoming Kameo character Madame Bo. In the trailer we see her Fatal Blow, a move in which she batters her enemy’s face with her slipper. Madam Bo will be available as a content update for all Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns owners at no additional cost or via standalone purchase on March 18.
T-1000 is the final DLC character set to be added to the 5 million-selling Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s success.
Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things,the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat.
In September, Mortal Kombat development chiefEd Boon said NetherRealm had decided on its next game three years prior, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”
Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series,Injustice: Gods Among Us, launched in 2013, with its sequel,Injustice 2, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm releasedMortal Kombat 11in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.
Inan interview with IGNin June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. ""There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't,"" Boon said.
Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).
""But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal,"" Boon said. ""We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' ""
Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.
""Not at all,"" Boon answered.

"How often does it just tell you to ‘git gud’?

Microsoft is preparing to add “artificial intelligence” — acomplete misnomerthat everyone continues to use nonetheless — to its video game platforms via the upcoming Copilot for Gaming program. An “early preview” is coming to mobile for Xbox Insiders soon, but we got ourfirst lookat how the gameplay assistant may function on the March 13 episode of The Official Xbox Podcast.
“This AI-driven sidekick is designed to be your personalized gaming companion, helping you get to your favorite games faster, coaching you to improve your skills, and connecting you better with your friends and communities,” Jeff Rubenstein, director of Xbox editorial, explained on Xbox Wire. “Copilot for Gaming will be there when you need it but out of the way if you don’t.”
A couple of the proof-of-concept Copilot for Gaming examples shown on The Official Xbox Podcast include suggesting items to create inMinecraftbased on what’s in the player’s inventory and providing an on-screen strategy guide for defeating a siege engine inAge of Empires IV.
The big question mark about Copilot for Gaming — and really anything that presents itself as “artificial intelligence” — is how it’s getting its information and from where. This technology isn’t learning in any real sense, but simply acting as a personalized search engine sifting through the terabytes ofillicitly obtaineddata OpenAI uses to train its GPT-4 large language model. Copilot for Gaming could very well be pulling info from any number of guides from sites like Polygon, Kotaku, and IGN or even tips shared on Reddit, ResetEra, and GameFAQs.
It’s also hard to take Microsoft at its word that one of Copilot for Gaming’s goals is “connecting you better with your friends” when The Official Xbox Podcast host Ethan Rothamel eagerly envisions a future where he won’t have to help guide his mom, who picked up gaming during COVID, through levels ofHuman Fall Flatanymore. Why share any sort of connection with your loved ones, especially those not previously predisposed to gaming, when you can pawn them off on an AI assistant instead?
Polygon is in the process of asking Microsoft about these concerns and will report back when we learn more.

"GameCube games coming exclusively to the Switch 2'sexclusive online library is one of the best features of the new console. To make those membership costs just that little bit easier, UK retailerShopTohas NSO at 35% off right now, and there's an extra 5% when you use code SPRING at checkout. As you get yourNintendo Switch 2 preordersin, this is an absolute bonus bargain to consider.

While some Nintendo Classics catalogues are unlocked with the base online subscription, you'll also need the Expansion Pack to play GameCube titles on Nintendo Switch 2. What's more, while you can subscribe to a monthly model for just Nintendo Switch Online, the Expansion Pack is only available on the 12-month plan, so make a note when purchasing.
Currently, the individual versions of these combined 12-month subscriptions cost either £34.99 on the Nintendo eShop or £39.99 at retailers like ShopTo. But now, it seems like ShopTo are keen to get on the Switch 2 hype by slashing £14.14 off the individual plan and £15.14 off the family plans respectively.
So, if you're the only Nintendo Switch players in your household, you can buy theindividual Online + Expansion Pack plan for £24.55or theFamily Membership for £43.55with the promo code SPRING.
Overall, the family version is fantastic value as you can have up to eight Nintendo Accounts under a Family Group sharing the same membership, and you don't have to be in the same household either.
Under ShopTo's new price, that's as low as £5.60 per person getting to enjoy Nintendo Switch Online and the entire Expansion Pack's catalogue of games—including GameCube gemsPokemon XD: Gale of Darkness,Soulcalibur 2, andThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker— for a whole year.
If you're like me, though, and have already have a basic Nintendo Switch Online membership active until next year, the only way to upgrade is through Nintendo themselves—either on their website or the eShop—without a direct discount from retailers like ShopTo.
However, a way to get around that is by purchasingdiscounted digital Nintendo eShop gift cards from Currys. Buy entering the code ""NINTENDODIGITAL10"" at checkout, you'll get 10% off on£15,£25,£50,£75, and£100amounts of eShop credit—saving you as much as £10.
In the case of upgrading your 12-month Nintendo Switch Online membership, the cost of which varies depending on how much is left, you can buy the closest amount you need or a larger amount at a bigger discount, and use any extra credit you have on digital games or save it to put toward your subscription next year.

"The most surprising reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct might have been a third-party game. Announced near the end of the showcase, FromSoftware is developing a brand-new game calledThe Duskbloods, which has some striking similarities to the beloved PlayStation 4-exclusive Bloodborne.

The Duskbloods is a new game, to be clear, set to arrive sometime in 2026 worldwide, and exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2. Playing as the ""Bloodsworn,"" a group that has gone beyond humanity thanks to special blood, players will enter a violent melee to become the ""First Blood.""
Confirmed in a press release from FromSoftware, The Duskbloods is a PvPvE title with ""online multiplayer at its core,"" with up to eight players battling for the win among themselves. So while all the blood, guns, and machinery brings to mind Bloodborne, it may also have quite a bit in common with the upcomingElden Ring Nightreign, though with some PvP rather than solely co-op PvE.
We didn't get much more than that, besides cryptic teases and some looks at some horrifying beasts and bosses. Still, Bloodborne fans are having a wide variety of reactions to this.
""BLOOD! EVERY FIVE SECONDS THEY TALKED ABOUT BLOOD!"" saidone commenter in the r/Bloodborne post about The Duskbloods on Reddit. Another said: ""That game is 100% Bloodborne 2. I assume the name change is either because it's in a different setting, or because of Sony exclusivity.""
Though The Duskbloods is still different, it's easy to see the connections that would have fans feeling like it's a spiritual sucessor to Bloodborne. And while the Souls games and Elden Ring have gone onto other systems — Elden Ring even got aTarnished Edition locked in for the Switch 2— Bloodborne has remained a PlayStation 4 exclusive since release, not even making it over to PC. A port, sequel, or really anything has been something fans have wanted for years.
""Nintendo really got tired of waiting for Bloodborne 2 and just decided to fund it themselves,"" anothercommenter said. Another reply points out that, much like Bloodborne, The Duskbloods is currently a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. ""Bloodborne was always an exclusive, this is on brand,"" areplier added.
The announcement definitely kick-started the Bloodborne faithful, though reality has been setting in with confirmation that this sounds like a battle royale-style game, rather than a single-player RPG you'd normally expect from FromSoftware.
Some commenters startedexpressing dulled excitementover the revelation that The Duskbloods is a PvPvE experience. Threads have sprung up of fans finding this out, only to then express that between a multiplayer focus and Switch 2 exclusivity, they might not be so eager to jump on for The Duskbloods.
We're due to learn more about The Duskbloods soon, as Nintendo will post an interview with director Hidetaka Miyazaki on its website on April 4. Presumably this will shed some light on how exactly The Duskbloods will work, what its PvPvE will look like, and whether this can truly be enough to sate the Bloodborne fans who've been holding out hope for so long.

"Ever since Nintendo officially revealed the Switch 2, all eyes have been on the upcoming April Direct. That’s when we’ll presumably get an official Switch 2 release date, price, and confirmed line-up of games. So the last thing I was expecting was for Nintendo to dropanotherDirect the week before then, packed with big names like Pokémon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4. But maybe given Nintendo’s commitments to backward compatibility, I shouldn’t be too surprised.

Prior to this week’s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo was careful to temper expectations by declaring “There will be no updates about Nintendo Switch 2 during the presentation.” While that’s technically true – Switch 2 wasn’t mentioned apart from a reminder about the upcoming Direct and the new Virtual Game Card sharing system – it’s not a huge leap to say that everything we saw this week will be playable on the Switch 2, even if, officially, thesegames are coming to the original Switch.
It’s a win-win situation for everyone involved - those sticking with the OG Switch still have plenty to be excited about as the console enters its eighth year, and anyone upgrading to Switch 2 can do so safe in the knowledge it will have an extensive back catalogue of games right from the get-go.
Nintendo’s commitment to backward compatibility is contributing to what I think will be one of the smoothest transitions we’ve ever seen between console generations. Of course, most are excited to see what the Switch 2 can do and what new games are incoming, but byplaying it safe with the hardware, Nintendo has all bases covered. Based on the most recent Nintendo Direct, you wouldn’t think Nintendo is trying to sell as many Switch 2 pre-orders in the run-up to launch and convince people to upgrade. And that inclusive approach should be applauded. Nintendo is essentially saying everyone is welcome, whether you’re looking to buy a Switch 2 at launch, upgrade further down the line, or are content to keep the Switch you already own.
That’s why there was no risk in showcasing the multitude of Switch games less than a week before a dedicated Switch 2 Direct drops, even when just beneath the surface of the Direct Nintendo was putting down even more groundwork for the coming succession. I’m talking aboutthe Virtual Game Card system, which is an update that allows Switch owners to link two consoles together and share digital games. It’s a useful feature, especially with digital games sales on the rise, and it’s similar to the family sharing system Steam has. But why announce it at the very end of the Switch life cycle when the Switch 2 is literally weeks or months away? Presumably to make the transition to Switch 2 even smoother.
Some have pointed out that the fine print for the Virtual Game Card indicates the existence of a “Switch 2 Edition” for certain games. Whether that means there are exclusive enhancements to Switch 2 Edition games that make them unshareable with the older Switch, exclusive re-releases that will only work on Switch 2, or something else entirely, is still a mystery. But in the same way Nintendo said “Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported or fully compatible with Switch 2” when it was announced, this fine print likely covers Nintendo’s bases in the case of there being any unshareable games.
Whatever that fine print means, it feels like Nintendo is treating the road to Switch 2 almost like a procession, a bit like the way Apple moves from one iPhone to the next. You don’t have to upgrade but there are definitely benefits if you do, and you can bring whatever games you had before along for the ride.

This is a well-rated power station that's compact in size and is equipped with safe and reliable LiFEPO4 batteries. It can even be remotely monitored and controlled with the Ecoflow mobile app. Ecoflow has an excellent longstanding reputation and is continuously rolling out new firmware and software updates for its products.
For those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says ""powerful Pokémon"" like an angry robot penguin).
I'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.
If somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.
Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).
If you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, ""I really need to delete some games,"" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.
Samsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room. The Acoustic Lens Subwoofer ensures deep, punchy bass, while Adaptive Sound and Game Mode Pro make sure everything from dialogue to explosions sounds crisp. At $764 off, this is the cheapest we’ve seen it outside of Black Friday.
LG B4 OLED TVbrings incredible picture quality at a price that doesn’t require selling a kidney. It features Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, an α8 AI Processor that automatically enhances whatever you’re watching, and LG’s latest webOS for easy access to streaming apps and over 300 free LG Channels. Gamers get Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and VRR, plus four HDMI 2.1 ports. At $499.99, this is one of the best deals for an OLED right now.
Samsung’s S90D OLED TVis a beast, packing AI-powered 4K upscaling, Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for silky smooth gameplay, and Dolby Atmos for immersive sound. Real Depth Enhancer makes everything look more lifelike, and PANTONE validation ensures accurate color reproduction. At $300 off, this is a great price for a high-end 65” OLED TV.
Sony’s WH-CH520 headphonesoffer 50 hours of battery life, customizable sound settings, and a lightweight, comfortable design. Multipoint connection makes switching between devices seamless, and DSEE upscaling improves compressed audio. At just $35.95, these are one of the best budget wireless headphones out there today.
Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 bring top-tier noise cancellation, a Tensor A1 chip for AI-powered audio enhancements, and large 11mm drivers for rich bass. Conversation Detection automatically switches to transparency mode when you talk, so you don’t have to take them out. If you need premium wireless earbuds, this is asolid deal for these 9/10 buds.
Enshrouded is a survival RPG with deep crafting, intense combat, and massive co-op potential. Play solo or team up with up to 16 friends, build custom bases, and fight through a dark, mysterious world. It’s still in early access, but at $23.99, it’s worth jumping in now aswe gave it 8/10.

"Um dos gêneros mais populares e importantes dos videogames na última década foi o soulslike. Encabeçado pela FromSoftware e títulos como Dark Souls, Bloodborne e, mais recentemente, Elden Ring, essa categoria derivada dos RPGs de ação reverbera sucessos há 10 anos. Para embarcar nessa onda, a desenvolvedora Neople e a publicadora Nexon criaram The First Berserker: Khazan, novo soulslike baseado no universo do aqui no Brasil quase desconhecido Dungeon Fighter Online, que deixa as raízes de Dark Souls de lado para se inspirar em Nioh e nos soulslikes da Team Ninja.
Durante as minhas mais de 35 horas de jogo, pude encontrar muitas qualidades no combate e construção de builds baseadas nos inúmeros itens que podemos combinar, mas me senti extremamente entediado com um level design fraco, uma repetição de inimigos no mínimo esquisita e personagens desinteressantes. The First Berserker: Khazan é um jogo muito intenso para o bem e para o mal, mas consegue demonstrar proeminência naquilo que se propõe a ser: um soulslike desafiador.
Com uma narrativa um tanto quanto comum em histórias de brucutus em busca de vingança, o jogo segue esse mesmo caminho e nos apresenta Khazan, um poderoso general do império de Pell Los, que é condenado injustamente e exilado para montanhas nevadas por traição ao imperador. No entanto, o acaso do destino faz com que ele seja “salvo” por um espírito maligno que o possui e assim começa uma longa jornada de vingança. A premissa é bastante básica, mas a extensão do universo faz com que a narrativa ganhe camadas de profundidade, embora nenhuma delas consiga tornar o enredo cativante de verdade.
Mesmo com reviravoltas mirabolantes, a trama de traição se mantém clichê do início ao fim e em diversos momentos é sonolenta. Os personagens de suporte também são imemoráveis e apenas uma se destacou para mim entre aliados e inimigos: Elamein. Apesar de o vilão ser bom, ele não sustenta a trama fraca. A história é definitivamente o ponto mais baixo do jogo, mas que não pesa tanto graças ao combate sólido e eficiente – pelo menos na maioria das vezes.
O ponto de maior destaque e brilho de The First Berserker: Khazan é, sem dúvidas, o combate. Extremamente fluido, veloz, intenso, cheio de variedade de armas e habilidades. O game é um soulslike bastante voltado para o parry, mas não de uma forma semelhante a Sekiro. Aqui, a ausência de escudo obriga você a dominar a habilidade de aparar ataques e de desviar no momento certo, porém a esquiva é curta e muitas vezes é a pior opção para escapar de ataques.
Quando partirmos para o ataque, no entanto, vemos aqui onde a equipe da Neople depositou grande parte dos esforços. Khazan é como uma mistura de Kratos, o Chosen One de Dark Souls e o Lobo de Sekiro — tudo isso parece confuso, mas quando o controlamos as coisas se alinham. O jogo apresenta três opções de arma: lanças, empunhadura dupla com espada e machado e, por fim, a espada de duas mãos. Na minha gameplay, optei pela lança na maior parte do tempo, afinal, o dano me pareceu mais equilibrado e a velocidade de ataque me satisfez mais.
O crescimento da jogabilidade é exponencial: no começo temos combos simples e ataques com dardo — semelhante ao arco e flecha. No entanto, conforme aprofundamos a vasta árvore de habilidades de Khazan, as lutas se tornam mais fluidas, sangrentas e polidas de certa forma. Mesmo assim, não pude deixar de observar que em algumas situações a hitbox me pareceu meio confusa e até mesmo problemática, tanto para inimigos quanto para armadilhas do cenário, mas foram casos bem específicos e que não se repetiram.
Os combos de lança são dinâmicos e se encaixaram perfeitamente na minha gameplay. Consegui acabar com inimigos rapidamente, mas precisamos falar sobre o equilíbrio de dificuldade muito peculiar que o jogo apresenta.
Quanto às batalhas de chefe, algumas são básicas, desde a música e movimentos do inimigo até as arenas, enquanto outras mostram o potencial do jogo e exigem o uso máximo das mecânicas de The First Berserker. Na minha experiência pessoal, nenhuma delas merece grande destaque, exceto a batalha final que é digna de um grande RPG de ação pela magnitude do combate.
Um grande destaque do jogo é a criação de builds que se baseia muito nos sistemas de Nioh. É possível ter muito controle dos status do personagem e adaptar Khazan para a sua arma e jogabilidade. Itens do mesmo set concedem bônus conforme você equipá-los e acumular status.
O único sistema ruim de combate é o de invocações, que não ajudam em nada durante as batalhas de chefe e muitas vezes apenas atrapalham. No entanto, os fantasmas são um bom suporte em lutas rotineiras.
Obviamente, por ser um soulslike, The First Berserker: Khazan possui uma dificuldade acentuada, mas os picos de complexidade em progredir no jogo são… esquisitos. Alguns chefes e mapas iniciais são muito difíceis, enquanto algumas batalhas intermediárias contra inimigos de elite e até mesmo os chefões não apresentam desafio, e, por fim, as batalhas mais avançadas são surpreendentemente fáceis. Isso seria normal caso esses picos de dificuldade fossem parte da progressão que, obviamente, fica menos complexa conforme o avançar do jogo, mas The First Berserker tem uma inconsistência de dificuldade que, a meu ver, mostra uma falha de balanceamento no jogo que empobrece a experiência.
Um dos maiores destaques da FromSoftware em Dark Souls é o mapa minuciosamente conectado que possui atalhos e conexões que exploram a sagacidade dos designers em produzir essas fases. Infelizmente, por optar em se inspirar na Team Ninja e jogos como Nioh e Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, o level design de The First Berserker: Khazan se perde em diversos momentos.
Apesar de contar com áreas vastas e alguns atalhos, muitas regiões do mapa parecem sem vida ou possuem conexões um tanto quanto sem sentido que seriam melhores apenas colocando outra espada da fenda, a “bonfire” do game, para tornar a ligação entre áreas dos biomas mais inteligentes. O jogo poderia olhar mais para Lies of P e criar um level design muito melhor, mas se inspirou justamente em soulslikes com design de mapa problemáticos.
A má qualidade do level design se alinha à repetitividade de inimigos, aspecto ainda mais evidente quando olhamos para as missões secundárias, que reutilizam esses cenários com pequenas mudanças e tornam o jogo cansativo ao longo do tempo.
The First Berserker: Khazan é intenso para o bem e para o mal. Quando o jogo está imerso em seu combate, criação de builds e algumas batalhas de chefe, ele brilha e muito, quase alcançando a prateleira dos ótimos soulslikes. Contudo, o level design ruim, repetição de inimigos, história sonolenta e dificuldade inconsistente fazem ele cair de patamar e ser só mais um soulslike, embora ainda figure entre os bons títulos do gênero, não mais do que isso. Os amantes de Nioh e de jogatinas difíceis encontrarão muita diversão em mais de 35 horas de campanha.",1161,"The First Berserker: Khazan é um novo soulslike baseado no universo do aqui no Brasil.

"For a limited time, Target is offering an outstanding deal on one of thebest noise cancelling headphones. Right now you can get a pair ofSony WH-1000XM4noise cancelling wireless headphones for just $179.99 after you clip a 50% off Target Circle coupon (membership is free). This is the lowest price we've seen for this particular model and beats out last year's Black Friday price by $20. Sony's headphones are considered by many to be the best noise cancelling headphones out there, beating out stiff competition from other popular brands like Bose and Beats.

The Sony WH-1000XM4 isn't the newest model in its series - it's one generation behind theWH-1000XM5- but headphone technology moves at a snail's pace. Even 5 years after its original launch, the WH-1000XM4 is still an excellent headphone that performs favorably compared to newer heavy hitters. It offers great sound quality, effective active noise cancellation, and comfortable ergonomics (arguably more comfortable than the WH-1000XM5). It features USB Type-C charging with up to 30 hours of battery life, Bluetooth Multipoint for simultaneous pairing with up to two devices, and a compact profile thanks to its foldable, swiveling design. You'd be hard pressed to find a better headphone under $200.
If you want the current generation of Sony's headphones, then AliExpress is offering the imported Sony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphones for only $225.18 after coupon code ""IFP7FJZ"" is applied..  This product is stocked in a US warehouse, so it ships free and arrives within 1-2 weeks. Imported models are brand new and retail packaged, however they carry an overseas warranty that won't be honored in the United States. AliExpress makes up for it with a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days. Improvements over the WH-1000XM4 include better noise cancellation, better passive isolation, and sleeker aesthetics
Sony WH1000XM5 Reviewby Kevin Lee
""The Sony WH-1000XM5 is the big upgrade we’ve been waiting for from Sony’s flagship wireless headphones. The new design and AI makes the noise-canceling stronger while the ambient listening mode is splendidly natural. Audio quality is impeccable too – whether you want to listen to intricate classical music or a rocking action movie, these headphones can do it all.""

"This week is pure action and pure puzzle
byTyler Colp
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
The new game releases this week give you two choices: puzzles or action. There’s really no in between. Action fans get to fight monsters with magical powers inSouth of Midnightor take on intense multiplayer heists inMonaco 2. Puzzle fans get to explore an ever-changing mansion inBlue Princeor take the time to unravel the mysteries ofThe Talos Principle: Reawakened.
It’ll be a tough decision if you like both genres, because most of these games drop on the same day, but a few of them are less traditional than others.Star Overdrivesticks out in the action category as a game with monsters to fight but also hoverboard tricks to pull off. AndJumping Jazz Catsis a game where the action consists of an army of cats racing to complete minigames.
Here are our most anticipated game releases for the week of April 7.
Release date:April 8Platforms:Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis action game is steeped in folklore and set in the American Deep South. The world is infested with gruesome monsters that seem to be pain and trauma made manifest. Your job as Hazel, a magic-wielding Weaver, is to mend your community and hopefully find a place to call home yourself.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis pitch for this puzzle game is like nightmare mode for anyone in fear of getting stumped. It’s set in a mansion where the rooms and their puzzles change as each day passes. The goal is to find Room 46, but you’ll need to be extremely clever to keep up with the constantly shifting obstacles.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThey put the philosophical puzzle game into Unreal Engine 5. This updated version has all kinds of new stuff, including a new chapter in the story, quality-of-life improvements, and a tool to make puzzles yourself.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis co-op heist game requires teamwork and clever thinking. You get to play as unique characters with tools to overcome the various security measures and guards in your way. Each level is procedurally generated, too, so every run will be slightly different.
Release date:April 10Platforms:Nintendo SwitchTony Hawk’s Pro SkatermeetsNo Man’s Skyin this hoverboard action game. You get to ride around on alien planets, solve puzzles, and pull off tricks. And as if this game didn’t sound cool enough, you also fight enemies with a keytar.
Release date:April 10Platforms:Windows PCI’m not going to lie to you: I mostly chose this game simply because it’s calledJumping Jazz Cats. But it also looks pretty fun. You and up to eight other players get to run around and play minigames as little cats. Well, they’re called “minigames,” but they look more like a bunch of excuses to absolutely wreck the house of your absent owners.

"Amazon quietly restocked a bunch ofPokémon TCG bundles just days agoand stock is already running low. These Scarlet & Violet sets have been MIA for weeks, and now they’re back at retail prices. I already added a couple to my cart,Surging SparksBooster Bundle,Shrouded FableETB and Paldean Fates Booster Bundle. Trainers need to snap these up quick. If they’re gone by the time you get there, that’s on you.

Looking for the least expensive PlayStation 5 console you can your hands on? As part of its US Anniversary Sale, AliExpress is offering an importedSony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Editiongaming console for $367.94 shipped after $80 off coupon code ""MAYUE008"". This is a brand new and retail boxed product that is stocked in a US warehouse and qualifies for local delivery, which means it ships free and arrives within about 1-2 weeks.
I also spotted a couple of power banks on sale from INIU and Anker. If you’ve ever watched your phone die mid-flight or mid-text, you know why I’m excited. These things are cheap, fast, and less annoying than asking strangers for a charger at an airport. Do with that information what you will. Oh, and while we’re on the topic of things I absolutely don’t need but definitely want: theGamera: Attack of Legionaction figure is up for preorder at the IGN Store for a cool $560, and Humble Bundle just dropped a massiveDragonlance book bundlethat practically dares you to add 25+ fantasy novels to your backlog for the price of lunch.
I want this bundle purely for the thrill of cracking six packs in a row and pretending I’m building a deck for Worlds. The Surging Sparks expansion is still new enough to feel fresh, and at $45.02, it’s a decent value compared to scalper prices that make you question your financial decisions. If you just want to dip into the latest set without going full collector mode, this is it.
Shiny Pokémon are back, and apparently so is my addiction to them. The Paldean Fates bundle gives you six chances to pull something sparkly, and while $69.94 isn’t exactly pocket change, I think the potential dopamine hit is worth the gamble. It’s in stock, it ships fast, and I’ve made worse choices at 2 a.m. on eBay.
I’m not saying this is the nerdiest thing you can buy today, but it’s definitely on the leaderboard. Humble Bundle just dropped a massive Dragonlance collection; 25+ books for about the cost of lunch. If you’ve ever wanted to get lost in magical twin drama, cursed artifacts, or the politics of dwarves (because who hasn’t), this is your sign. Plus, part of your purchase supports Room to Read, so now your TBR pile can come with good karma.
In my opinion, this is the one to grab if you're all-in on the set. Nine booster packs, a Pecharunt promo, themed sleeves, dice, and an actually-useful storage box? For $54.96? I’ve spent more on less at Taco Bell. Plus, it's still Prime eligible, which means you don’t have to sell your soul for free shipping. Win-win.
This is what happens when you give kaiju collectors exactly what they want: a 9.5-inch figure of LEGION fromGamera 2, complete with flying parts, glowing bits, and articulation that would make Spider-Man jealous. Sure, it’s $560, but I’ve seen statues half as cool go for double that. If you’re the kind of person who rearranges shelf space for something before buying it, I totally get it.
This thing charges your phone like it’s got something to prove. At $26.98, it gives you a full week’s worth of backup power and a built-in flashlight just in case you drop your phone and your dignity under your car seat. I want it purely because it has an LED readout that makes me feel like I’m operating a mission control panel instead of just charging my AirPods.
I think this is the best deal of the day, and not just because it’s $17.99. It’s slim, light, and can survive a drop better than my will to stay off social media. Anker knows what it’s doing, and this charger just works. No random overheating, no mystery ports, just plug it in and keep scrolling through whatever app is currently ruining your sleep schedule.
Hulu + Live TVoffers a three-day free trialthat allows you to take the live TV streaming service for a spin. This is one of the overallbest streaming free trialsbecause it gets you a bundle of services. It is quite a bit shorter than the standard Hulu free trial of 30 days, but it's a great way to test it out over the weekend.
With a 240Hz refresh rate, Dual QHD resolution, and 0.03ms response time, this 49-inch ultrawide OLED is built for high-performance PC gaming. The 1800R curve and HDR True Black 400 make it incredibly immersive, while FreeSync Premium Pro helps keep gameplay smooth and responsive.
This Android tablet comes with an S Pen included, a 10.4-inch display, and Samsung DeX for multitasking. At under $200, it’s a solid pick for casual gamers, students, or anyone who wants a lightweight, entertainment-ready tablet with productivity perks.
Celebrate Women's History Month with a killer bundle featuring female-led games. Titles include Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, Control: Ultimate Edition,Darksiders III,Beyond: Two Souls, and more. It’s a $160+ value for just $12, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity.
With a whopping 10,000Pa of suction, self-refilling, self-emptying, sonic mopping, and even hot-air mop drying, the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra takes hands-off cleaning to the next level. It's packed with AI features and even supports pet tracking and video calls.
Amazon’s newest Kindleadds color to the mix with a 7"" Colorsoft display. It still lasts up to 8 weeks on a single charge and now supports wireless charging and full-color highlights. It's ideal for reading graphic novels, cookbooks, or anything where visuals matter.
Enjoy spatial audio, active noise canceling, and up to 40 hours of battery life. These over-ear headphones are compatible with both iOS and Android, and support lossless audio over USB-C. A strong option for commuters, creators, and music lovers.
This Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code ""IFPRZAZ"" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16"" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.
$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.
I think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.
If you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.
At $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.
$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.
This speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.
Crisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.
This speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.
Bass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.
XM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.
A wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.
My living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.
I didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.
This TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.
I want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.
This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.

"Microsoft has unveiled a list of Xbox Game Pass titles set to join the service in the first half of April 2025, revealing a strong lineup of first- and third-party games, including South of Midnight, Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition, Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls – Ultimate Evil Edition, and more.

It’s a remarkably strong month that was detailed in a recentXbox Wirepost. Expect major hitters to start dropping in tomorrow, April 3, kicking off the month with Gearbox Software’s Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition (Cloud, Console, and PC) for all tiers, while All You Need Is Help (Console), Still Wakes the Deep (Xbox Series X | S), and Wargroove 2 (Console) all join Game Pass Standard. There’s more than enough in this first block to keep even the most dedicated Xbox fan busy all month, but you’ll only have five days before South of Midnight (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) and Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls – Ultimate Evil Edition (Console and PC) arrive for all Game Pass subscribers April 8.
South of Midnight, Compulsion Games’ Deep South-set folklore adventure, is poised to be one of Xbox’s biggest releases of the year, and its presence on Game Pass will no doubt have hordes of players seeing what it has to offer. Microsoft’s official description sheds more light on how it will bring some life to Game Pass this month: “Explore the mythos and confront mysterious creatures of the Deep South in this modern folktale while learning to weave an ancient power to surmount obstacles and face the pain haunting your hometown.”
April 9 follows with Commandos: Origins (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, with Blue Prince (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) coming to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass tiers April 10. Finally, Hunt: Showdown 1896 (PC) will round out the Wave 1 drops come April 15 when it is added for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers.
Xbox Game Pass perks are also getting a refresh for the first half of April 2025.

"﻿If I have to buy another fucking Joy-Con, I’m going to scream
byCharlie Hall
Halfway through October 2021, my youngest daughter, just 7 years old at the time, came to me with concern in her eyes. TheNintendo Switchwouldn’t turn on, and its last few moments of operation were concerning. Something about a download that had just completed, she said, and a button that said “update.” That was the end of the line for that particular unit, but only the beginning of my troubles with a console that would proceed to try my patience until this very day — an experience that makes me loath to considerbuying the Nintendo Switch 2.
The Hall family had been victim to a technical snafu as old as mobile devices themselves: the dreaded low-power firmware update. That’s when a device, like an iPhone or a graphics card or a $250 red-and-black plastic hunk of shit, loses power while it’s upgrading its most important layer of software. Firmware refers to the pieces of code that tell a device that it’s a device and not a 398-gram brick, and as I took the tripartite console from my daughter’s tiny little hands — where it was cradled like a dead bird — I knew that it was a total loss. But that wasn’t the worst part.
Inside that black mirror of despair were dozens of tiny, furry neighbors — herdigital friends fromAnimal Crossing: New Horizons. The newisland backupfeature had only recently been introduced, and her idiot father hadn’t yet taken the time to perform the arcane rites required to save a Nintendo Switch game to the cloud.
Her friends were all dead, of that I was sure. So, too, was the bell-selling knickknack shop that she and her older sister had built from scratch before showing it off on the Polygon Twitch channel. My house, my wife’s house, thosedamnable ladders and bridges that took weeks to build, and, of course, the peach trees that we all loved so much… none of them were ever coming back.
Ultimately, it’s my fault. I’m the user here, and it was my error. But I get to beangry at Nintendofor not making something like backing up hundreds of hours of irretrievable gameplay, shared joyfully during the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, just a little bit easier, or — dare I say it — a feature that gets turned on automatically from the start.
Everything about the Switch is a quirk, and some of them are more obnoxious than others
But Nintendo doesn’t treat the cloud like other console manufacturers do. It doesn’t treat online storefronts like other console manufacturers do, either. Or onboard storage. Or game cartridges. Or online multiplayer. Or friends lists. Or televisions, for that matter. Everything about the Switch is a quirk, and some of them are more obnoxious than others.
While having our original Nintendo Switch replaced by a refurbished one set me back pert near $120, I’ve easily spent at least that much buying additional controllers over the years. Both of the Joy-Cons that shipped with our original Switch suffered fromJoy-Con drift, something that my children suffered through wordlessly for months before I realized it.
“What is happening to Mario?” I asked one day while watching the girls play in the basement.
“Oh, that’s just how the controllers work now,” said my oldest. I was incredulous. There is no scenario where I would accept anything other than absolute obeisance from a human input device, but here my kids were making do, trying to complete nefarious jumping puzzles with a joystick that was barely capable of walking a virtual avatar in a straight line. Suffice it to say that they eventually lost the taste for piloting the tiny red plumber — especially when it took the better part of two months to get our controllers back after being repaired under the warranty.
When the next two broke, I just threw them away. It wasn’t even worth a trip to the post office for me.
Today we’re in a better place, thanks. The girls both have healthy relationships with video game consoles like the Xbox Series X, with iPhones and iPads, and with Windows PCs, as well as a catalog of games that each of them can call home. But they remain literally afraid of the Nintendo Switch, a console that let them down multiple times for various reasons. I can’t even coax them to bring it along for road trips.
They won’t forget that experience, and I won’t either. And that’s why I’m waving off the Nintendo Switch 2. I’ve got enough to worry about in the year of our lord 2025 that risking a visitation from another wonky portable console isn’t even on my radar.

"Nintendo’s new Mario Kart is pricey
byMichael McWhertor
We knew there was a new Mario Kart coming to Switch 2, but we didn’t expect it to cost this much. After showing off the open-world racing gameMario Kart Worldon Wednesday during itsSwitch 2 Nintendo Directshowcase, Nintendo revealed that the game will have a $79.99 price tag. That’s new territory for Nintendo, which just two years ago made headlines bycharging $69.99forThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
ButMario Kart World’s high asking price doesn’t appear to be the standard for Switch 2 software. Nintendo also confirmed Wednesday thatDonkey Kong Bananza, coming to Switch 2 in July, will cost $69.99. Still, these are indicators that Nintendo is comfortable charging more not just for the Switch successor, but for its next-gen games too.
Those prices may only represent the digital versions of those Switch 2 games. Pricing announced in some territories shows that Nintendo plans to charge even more for the physical editions of games likeMario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananza.
Nintendo has not announced prices for other games or the Switch 2 upgrade packs that were revealed as part of Wednesday’s Nintendo Direct, though it did put a price on another Switch 2 launch game,Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, if only in Japan. That virtual exploration of the Switch 2 hardware will cost 990 yen for a digital copy, which will probably translate to a sub-$10 price in the U.S.
Price increases on software aren’t uncommon during next-generation console transitions. When the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 launched, standard game pricing jumped from $49.99 to $59.99, a price point that held steady for more than a decade. In 2020, alongside the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, prices crept up further, with some publishers charging $69.99 for certain games. Nintendo itself caught up with that trend withTears of the Kingdom,following Microsoft’s lead, with its first $69.99 game.
Despite the reality of inflation, the increasing cost of game development, and the value often associated with live-service games like Mario Kart, reaction to pricing for Switch 2 games has beenwidely negative. Combined with thehigh price of the Switch 2itself, Nintendo may have a harder time reaching the success of the original Switch than some expected.

"And you thought Lebron James in Multiversus was the wildest fighting games could get
byIan Walker
They actually did it. After teasinga mysterious collaborationwith Cristiano Ronaldo last year, SNK has announced the soccer player will be, not just a skin or promotional spokesperson, but a playable character in the upcomingFatal Fury: City of the Wolves. The fighting game launches in April.
Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of history’s greatest – and most controversial, due to multiple rape accusations made against him over the years — soccer players, both at the club level on teams like Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus, and internationally with the Portugal national football team. While odd on paper, his appearance inFatal Fury: City of the Wolvescan likely be attributed to his popularity in Saudi Arabia playing for the Al-Nassr football club since 2023, as SNK is currently owned by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s non-profit MiSK Foundation.
Ronaldo has also been known in recent years for arape allegationthat was first made public in 2017 when German website Der Spiegel published asettlementbetween the soccer player and an accuser who claimed Ronaldo raped her in Las Vegas in 2009. Ronaldo reportedly paid the woman a sum of $375,000 for signing a non-disclosure agreement.
The victim filed a civil lawsuit against Ronaldo in Nevada in 2018, charging the athlete’s team with violating the previous confidentiality agreement by denying the allegations publicly following the Der Spiegel report and requesting $25 million in damages. Her case wasdismissedin 2022 due to “bad-faith conduct” by her attorney, and a subsequent appeal wasdeniedthe following year.
Fatal Fury: City of the Wolvesis the first new entry in the pre-King of Fighters series in almost 25 years. Other playable characters include Andy Bogard, Mai Shiranui, and Joe Higashi as well as crossover appearances from Street Fighter cast members Chun-Li and Ken Masters. It launches on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on April 24.

"Amazon is really jacking up the gaming deals in theirSpring Deal Days sale, giving you the limited-time chance to buy a new wirelessXbox controller from just £35.99. While some of the other selections are £4.50 more, the whole selection of colours available for these Series X|S controllers has had a price reduction, so you're getting at least 33% off whichever one you like most.

As a second or spare controller for your Xbox Series X or S console, along with supported games on PC, all those on sale at Amazon right now include the following colours:
Although the standard Carbon Black and Robot White—those bundled with the Xbox Series X & S consoles respectively—have been reduced to the lowest price of £35.99, all of the alternative colors have been dropped to a slightly higher yet still impressive £40.49. If you're in need of a new controller to play the newest games, likeCall of Duty: Black Ops 6which is on sale now as well, this is a fantastic opportunity.
You have to flaunt Amazon a little bit more of your cash to add a splash of style to your setup with one of these vivid color schemes likeAstral Purple, but it does seem worth it. What's more, these other models include the controller's updated design, featuring the X, A, B, and Y buttons being switched from their respective blue, green, red, and yellow colours to match that of their controllers' body.
The original button colours are still shown as tiny dots next to each one, but this update overall gives the controllers a more modest, sleeker appeal that arguably justifies the slightly larger price investment.
For those after a controller with a design that boasts more than one solid colour, Amazon UK also has the Special Fire Vapor Edition of the Xbox Series X|S controller as well,reduced by 20% to £51.99. Featuring titular vapor-like red-and-orange swirls, this bold colour scheme will invoke a little extra energy into your console setup if that's what you're looking for.

"The biggest mystery of our era finally explained
byIan Walker
After months of speculation, we now know what happens when you press the Switch 2’s mysterious C button thanks totoday’s Nintendo Direct presentation.
The C button is all about GameChat, a new Switch 2 feature that looks a lot like Discord video chat. It allows you to communicate with friends in both handheld and docked modes using a microphone built into the gamepad as well as share your screen.
GameChat even works between people playing different games. Nintendo has also included built-in parental controls that will make it necessary for kids to get permission to use these features.
Switch 2 will also launch with a camera that puts you on screen, either overlaid on top of the gameplay or by yourself.
Nintendo Switch Online will be required to use GameChat, but the feature will be available without a membership through March 31, 2026.
The C buttonfirst appearedas a new, unmarked Joy-Con button during the Switch 2 revealback in January. Speculation as to its purposebegan immediately. Most thought about functionality first, guessing it might be for sharing screenshots or launchinga Miiverse-style social media hub, but others went a more silly route by envisioning the button as summoning the late, great Peter Falk as Lieutenant Frank Columbo or making a funny noise and nothing else. I’ll leave you all to argue whether Wednesday’s reveal is better or worse than those guesses.

"Assassin’s Creed Shadows has seen over 3 million players since launch, Ubisoft has announced.

The player milestone comes seven days after Shadows launched on May 20, and is up from the 2 million reported on day two, surpassing the launches of both Origins and Odyssey.
Other stats reported by Ubisoft today were already revealed by IGN’s coverage of an internal email in which the company contextualized Shadows’ opening weekend performance, sayingit’s better compared to Origins and Odyssey rather than the “perfect storm” 2020’s Valhalla launched into.
Shadows saw the second highest day one sales revenue in Assassin's Creed franchise history, behind only Valhalla, the biggest Ubisoft day one ever on the PlayStation Store, and has seen over 40 million hours played so far.
There is enormous pressure onAssassin's Creed Shadowsto do well for Ubisoft globally after a number of delays and the sales failure of last year’sStar Wars Outlaws. Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number ofhigh-profile flops,layoffs,studio closures, andgame cancellationsin the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release.
Things got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family wasreportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investorson a buyout deal that would let it preserve control of the company's intellectual property. So, the video game world is watching Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ early performance closely for signs of its success — or failure.
There’s also a lot of attention on Shadows’ Steam concurrents, which are being compared to those of other triple-A single-player games that recently released, as well as previous Assassin’s Creed games on Valve’s platform.
Shadows became the most-played Assassin's Creed game ever on Steam over the weekend with 64,825 peak concurrent players, although it’s worth noting that it was the first game in the series to launch day-one there since 2018's Odyssey. BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardsaw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.
It’s hard to make a call on whether Shadows is below, meeting, or exceeding Ubisoft’s expectations without knowing what those expectations were, a revenue figure, or a sales figure.
Money talks, of course, and irrespective of player numbers and engagement, it will be revenue brought in by Assassin’s Creed Shadows that determines the fate of not just the game, but Ubisoft itself. We may not get a clear picture of that until Ubisoft's next financial report in the coming months.

"If you’re a Minecraft die-hard, you might have seen one particularly sneaky Easter egg in the new film adaptationA Minecraft Movie— but all is not what it seems. According to Mojang Studios Senior Creative Director of Entertainment and producer on A Minecraft Movie, Torfi Frans Olafsson, that moment that seemed to be alluding to the 2010 Creepypasta storyHerobrineisn't an Easter egg, but a mistake the visual effects team ran out of time to fix.

Warning!Spoilers for A Minecraft Movie follow:
For context, A Minecraft Movie has a scene that takes place at the Woodland Mansion where Henry (Sebastian Hansen) meets an Enderman who puts him in a state where he’s able to see a vision of Steve (Jack Black), except the character is verbally berating him as his eyes go white. Because Herobrine is characterized as Steve with white eyes, fans were convinced that the moment signified that there was a future for the Creepypasta story within the MCU (Minecraft Cinematic Universe, duh).
However, Olafsson has cast doubt on this assumption. ""It’s super strange that all of their eyes were supposed to be purple but when it was rendered one of the characters eyes kept coming out white in the final rendered frames so we wound up keeping it like that, because the VFX studio ran out of time,"" he revealed onX / Twitter.
In the early Minecraft days, an anonymous poster on 4chan claimed they saw an in-game version of Steve with white eyes and weird powers showing up around the game. Following the post,a Creepypasta storysurfaced, which “revealed” that the character anomaly was actually the spirit of a dead player.
Olafsson's comment is being taken by many fans as a knowing wink to this being a genuine Herobrine Easter egg in A Minecraft Movie. After all, the joke is that it's an unfixable error, that Herobrine appears and can't be removed.
We’ve got plenty more on A Minecraft Movie, includinghow rowdy fans are creating wild scenes in the cinema, causing some to say it’s ruining their experience.
IGN’sA Minecraft Movie reviewreturned a 6/10. We said: “Napoleon Dynamite director Jared Hess puts a surprisingly specific and funny comic spin on A Minecraft Movie’s kid-friendly adventure, especially in its less antic first half.”

Used: Like New Condition
Looks and functions as if it were new. Moderate packing damage observed during inspection.
The PS Portal, Sony's handheld gaming accessory for the PS5 console, looks very much like an extended split-pad DualSense controller with an 8-inch 1080p LCD screen in the middle of it. It turns your PS5 into a gaming handheld by letting you stream games from your console at up to 60fps. The controller mirrors the same features found on the DualSense, including haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and a touchscreen interface that replaces the Dualsense's touchpad. The Portal can stream your games even when you're outside of your home, with the caveat that you have access tovery stable, very fastinternet connection. Keep in mind that the PS Portal is not a standalone device. This is strictly a remote player for the PlayStation 5, so you will need a PS5 to use it.
Update:You no longer need a PS5 to play games on the PS Portal. Now, rather than being limited to simply streaming games from a $500 console to a $200 handheld, Sony has introduced a feature that lets owners stream games directly from its PlayStation Now cloud streaming service. No PS5 required. Portal owners now have the option to either connect the Portal to their PS5 as before, or directly to Sony’s cloud servers. Choose the latter and suddenly you have access to a library of more than 120 games, including Ghost of Tsushima, Resident Evil 3 Remake, The Last of Us Part 1 Remastered, and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.It’s worth noting you must be a subscriber to the highest tier of PlayStation Plus, but $18 a month is much more attractive that splashing out $500 upfront plus an extra $70 a game.
It should be said that the PlayStation Portal isn’t the only way to stream your PS5 games over Wi-Fi within your home. You can mimic its functionality by downloading the PS Remote Play app on a mobile device, including other gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck.  That said, it's more complicated to set up and you'll lose out on some of the Dualsense's features.
PlayStation Portal Reviewby Seth Macy
""The PlayStation Portal is the most surprising device I've ever come away from loving after going in loaded with skepticism. It's such a better experience than using your phone with a slap-on controller, and it works so much better than I was anticipating. I really love the freedom it gives me to play my PS5 from anywhere with decent WiFi coverage, especially when the rest of my family was using the TV to (somewhat ironically) play the Switch. Bearing in mind that it’s in no way a stand-alone device and 100% requires a PlayStation 5 to function at all, the biggest things keeping the Portal from being a truly amazing device are its current lack of a way to access WiFi that requires a web browser to log in, and its lack of Bluetooth support for audio. For now, it's a great device that represents the best current solution for PlayStation Remote Play, and if it weren't for those two baffling caveats, I'd call this a must-own device for every PS5 owner who enjoys playing games on handheld – or has to compete for the household TV.""

"From House Flipper 2 to Crime Scene Cleaner, these are the best of the best
byMaddy Myers
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Spring is here, and that means it’s time for spring cleaning! No, I’m not referring to my actual home, which I guess I’m also going to clean at some point, but we aren’t going to discuss that today. I am referring, of course, to the far more soothing experience of cleaning up a virtual space in a video game. There’s just nothing quite like the sensation of moving a mop icon on top of a digital dirt pile and clicking, clicking, clicking until it all disappears. If real-life mopping were that satisfying and simple, maybe I would actually do it (instead I own thisrobot mop, which isgreat, but again, that’s not why we’re here).
You might not know it, given how often I talk aboutmy love ofElden Ringorparrying inDark Souls, but cleaning games are one of my favorite video game genres — the perfect counterpoint to a tough FromSoftware title, if I may say so. Also the perfect end to a tiring real-life day! The five games on this list have seriously soothed my brain, and now I pass them on to all of you.
Where to play:PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Windows PCDespite the title,House Flipper 2(and its predecessor,House Flipper) is not so much about flipping properties for resale as it is about doing miscellaneous cleanup jobs in a small town. Beyond brief email correspondence and cellphone calls with your boss, you never really need to interact with anybody in-game; you just go to various locations and use different cleaning implements and power tools to make total shitheaps into sparkling-clean, move-in-ready living spaces. You earn digital currency as you go, so you can unlock more tools to work even faster, but take it slow — every mission is a meditative experience worth treasuring.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Windows PCThe title of this game makes it sound like you might be some sort of official crime scene cleaner for a police department, but nope. You’re playing as a civilian who needs cash badly to help his sick daughter with expensive medical treatments, and you end up working for the mob to clean up crimes. It’s lucrative, OK? Despite the grisly title and dark premise,Crime Scene Cleaneris absolutely a comedy game, with the protagonist constantly delivering sarcastic one-liners about his predicament. Plus, the crimes requiring cleanup have often unfolded in bizarre and fun locations to explore, such as a museum filled with dinosaurs’ remains… and now, human ones.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Mac, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox OneAt first,Unpackingseems like a charming little experience in which you do the titular activity that no one enjoys doing in real life but that feels strangely satisfying in this game, perhaps due to the cute interior designs and animation style on display. Over time, though, you’ll realize there’s a story here of a specific person moving from place to place and living an entire life, reflected in the things they need to unpack at each one. The result is poignant and sweet.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Mac, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XDepending on what type of brain you have,A Little to the Left’s cleaning-oriented puzzles will either leave you frustrated or extremely satisfied… or both. This game isn’t so much about clicking on messes to make them disappear; instead it’s a series of hyper-specific object-based puzzles, most of which involve simply straightening things up. Others are more like aesthetic mind games that require you to figure out an ideal orientation for a certain set of objects (should they be ordered by size, by color, by shape…?). I couldn’t always tell what each puzzle required me to do, but for most of them, it was obvious enough and gave me the nice brain buzz when I figured it out.

"Amazon has recently dropped the price on the2TB SK Hynix P41 PlatinumPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVME solid state drive (SSD) to only $124.99 shipped. The SK Hynix P41 Platinum is one of thefastest PCI-E 4.0 SSDs available, has DRAM cache, and is considerably less expensive than other comparable SSDs like theSamsung 990 Pro($168) and theWD SN850X($154). This is an excellent SSD for either your PlayStation 5 console or gaming PC.

Update:Price has dropped again from $129.99 to $124.99.
SK Hynix might not be as recognizable of a brand as Samsung or Western Digital among consumers, but make no mistake that they are a major player in the flash memory market. SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and one of the world's largest memory chipmakers and semiconductor companies. They supply components for many reputable brands you've probably heard of, like Corsair and G.Skill.
The Platinum P41 is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read speeds of 7,000MB/s and write speeds of 6,500MB/s as well as random read speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and write speeds of 1.3 million IOPS. The Platinum P41 also has a dedicated DRAM cache, Most SSDs at this price point lack any DRAM cache and instead rely on HMB, or system memory, to cover the shortfall. In terms of reliability and stability, th Platinum P41 has been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written. It uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips, both of which are manufactured in-house. SK Hynix warranties this SSD with a 5 year warranty.
The SK Hynix P41 Platinum makes for a great secondary SSD for your PlayStation 5 console since it performs well above Sony's minimum speed recommendation of 5,600MB/s. It's possible this SSD will run fine without a heatsink, but we like to err on the side of caution and would recommend you install one for peace of mind. Besides, you can get a perfectly adequateslim PS5 heatsink for just $7.
The Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.

"Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition has hit its lowest price yet,now available for $49.99 at Amazon—its best deal to date, even beating Black Friday, according to our records, and even price-tracking siteCamelCamelCamel.

Originally released on October 8 forNintendo SwitchandPlayStation 4 (fully compatible with PS5), this collection brings together the first six mainline Final Fantasy games in their carefully remastered form. Square Enix has opted for refinement rather than reinvention, keeping the original pixelated aesthetic intact but sharpening it for modern displays.
The result is a collection that looks fantastic, whether on a massive TV or in handheld mode. The soundtrack has also received an orchestral upgrade, with legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu overseeing the new arrangements. On top of that, the package introduces a handful of thoughtful quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to disable random encounters and boost experience and gil gains—useful for those who want to focus on the story without the grind.
As a small but nostalgic extra, this edition includes a sticker sheet featuring 12 classic character sprites, including the Black Mage, a Moogle, Terra, Kain, and a mid-cackle Kefka. It’s not the most extravagant of bonuses, but it’s a fun little touch for fans of the series.
At its original $74.99 price, the collection was a tougher sell, but at $49.99, it's a much easier recommendation for anyone interested in the series’ origins. Whether you’re revisiting these classics or playing them for the first time, this is a well-executed remaster of six of themost influential RPGsever made. And with physical copies being the only collectible edition available, it might be worth picking up before they become harder to find, especially at this time.

The Deep Earth Collection, which includes the metallicVolcanic Red,Cobalt Blue, andSterling Silver. colorways are on sale for $54 after you apply coupon code:PLAY5in your shopping cart. That's about 33% off and better thanAmazon's Spring Sale.

Lenovo might not be the first store you'd think of for great deals on PlayStation controllers, but surprisingly, no one can match their pricing. This might be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, at least untilSony's PlayStation Days of Play Salethat will probably happen sometime in late May.
The original PS5 DualSense controller is decked out in the same white color scheme as the console itself and retails for $69.99. Since then,Sony has consistently released more and more colors, some of them more striking than others. In late 2023, Sony launched theDeep Earth collection, ""a new metallic colorway for PS5 accessories"" with aptly sounding names like Sterling Silver, Volcanic Red, and Cobalt Blue. These controllers retailed for $79.99 and were (and still are) one of the more striking color schemes. We rarely see these on sale compared to the other colors.
Color aside, the Dualsense is oft regarded as thebest PS5 controller under $100. It also makes for an excellent controller for your PC. The DualSense is modeled after the tried and true design and layout of previous PlayStation controllers, but it also packs in modern features such as haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone and speaker, integrated touchpad, internal gyroscope and accelerometer for motion sensing, and USB Type-C charging.

"Friendship opens in theaters Friday, May 9. This review is based on a screening at the 2025 SXSW Film and Television Festival.

Tim Robinson’s character in Friendship is so perfect for his comedic persona, it’s incredible that he didn’t write it himself. It was writtenforhim, to be clear; director Andrew DeYoung said in an interview last fall that he sent the screenplay to Robinson with a note that said he wanted Robinson for the part, and that he planned to shoot it like a Paul Thomas Anderson movie. (More on that later.) Friendless, clueless, and prone to fits of frustrated rage, Craig Waterman is like a character from Robinson’s cringe-comedy series I Think You Should Leave, with about as much depth and equal capacity for laughs.
Craig’s neighbor Austin is a perfect fit for Paul Rudd, too. Austin is a weatherman for a local news station, with a thick mustache, a glorious head of hair, a hot wife, and a successful local garage band. Austin has lots of friends, and likes to have them over for beers on a Friday night. Austin represents a certain type of quietly confident guy, the kind who collects vinyl and drinks craft brews and wears cool jeans that fit him just right. Craig, meanwhile, is neither confident nor quiet. He works for a company that specializes in making apps more addictive, is always holding an awkwardly oversized beverage, and buys all of his clothes from a company called Ocean View Dining.
The only person who can stand Craig is his wife Tami (Kate Mara) – and that comes and goes, frankly. He was the safe choice, a stable presence for Tami and their son Steven (Jack Dylan Grazer). Even so, Craig is inadequate as a provider: A running visual gag involves Tami trying to jam large floral arrangements into a tiny smart car, because Craig can’t afford to buy her a bigger one. He’s inadequate in a lot of ways, actually, and much of the humor in Friendship revolves around Craig’s metaphorical, feature-length cuckolding. His manhood is continually undercut by Tami, by Austin, by the guys at work, by Tami’s sexy firefighter ex, and even by Steven, who has two girlfriends and kisses his mom on the mouth.
Craig reacts like a Tim Robinson character, which is to say that he takes it until he explodes in a fit of impotent rage. Robinson’s comedy is all about inappropriate reactions to ridiculous scenes: Think of the I Think You Should Leave sketch with Tim Heidecker as a condescending, gazpacho-craving boyfriend who populates a game of Celebrity with the un-guessable names of ancient jazz musicians. And that style manifests from Friendship’s opening moments, at a support-group meeting where Tami says that her cancer has been in remission for a year now (this is never mentioned again, by the way) but that there are certain things that still bother her, like wondering if she’ll ever have an orgasm again. Then it’s Craig’s turn to share. “I’m orgasming just fine,” he says.
From there, we pivot to Craig’s burgeoning relationship with Austin, who’s new to the neighborhood and very generous towards the childlike idiot next door. They have a few “good hangs,” exploring the tunnels underneath their small town and foraging for wild mushrooms in the nearby woods. Then Craig humiliates himself at boys’ night, prompting Austin to politely tell him that he’s no longer interested in being bros. This happens a half-hour into this 100-minute movie, making its title somewhat misleading: Most of Friendship is about Craig’s freakout over being friend-dumped, rather than the friendship itself.
A series of escalating absurdist scenarios follow, the funniest of which sees Craig lying on the floor in the stockroom of a cell phone store and licking a toad an 18-year-old named T-Boy (don’t ask) tells him will take him on a mind-bending psychedelic journey. You’ll have to watch the movie to find out where Craig’s mind's eye takes him, but it’s silly and unexpected and gives Robinson the opportunity to have one of his signature tantrums. The surrealist touches in DeYoung’s filmmaking are minimal, but he is fond of the evocative push-ins and Steadicam tracking shots favored by his professed inspiration Anderson, an elevated directing style that feels like a tongue-in-cheek bit in a comedy like Friendship.
Rudd basically disappears after the first act, and Mara literally disappears into the sewers for a few scenes. Robinson’s frequent collaborator (and fellow chronicler of brain-rotted 21st-century guys) Conner O’Malley shows up for a cameo, standing on a chair and ranting about how “we should still be in Afghanistan.” Robinson loses his phone in a puddle, smashes another one against a wall, and ruins several pairs of OVD khakis. His physical-comedy instincts are impeccable, even when the whole thing starts to feel repetitive after a while. (For comparison’s sake: Friendship runs about as long as a full season of I Think You Should Leave.)
The overall effect is of a series of interconnected comedy sketches on the loose themes of manhood and male bonding, which are hilarious if you vibe with Robinson’s style of humor and insufferable if you don’t. Friendship got big laughs at SXSW, leaving a handful of Robinson naysayers alienated and stone-faced in their theater seats. Sounds like the premise for a Tim Robinson sketch.
Paul Rudd and Tim Robinson are both perfectly cast as neighbors – one cool and confident, the other a frustrated loser – in Friendship. The feature debut from director Andrew DeYoung is an absurdist take on the buddy comedy that plays like a loosely connected series of  sketches from Robinson’s Netflix hit I Think You Should Leave. That grows repetitive within a 100-minute timeframe, but DeYoung keeps things interesting with the kind of filmmaking flourishes you’d never see in a streaming sketch series.",968,"Friendship got big laughs at SXSW, leaving a handful of Robinson naysayers alienated and stone-faced in their theater seats.

"This article contains spoilers for theInvincibleSeason 3 finale.

After eight episodes featuringhugecharacter deaths, multiple Invincibles (Steven Yeun), and so, so much blood and guts, Invincible Season 3 is in the books. Unlike Season 2, which ended with a relatively quieter tag for the finale, Season 3 not only teed up atonof storylines for the already-in-production Season 4… It also included a mid-credits scene that sets up a storyline Invincible co-creator Robert Kirkman never got to do in the comic books.
Before we get to that closing montage – and mid-credits scene – a bit of explanation about the finale itself. It’s for the most part one, long fight scene as Invincible, Oliver (Christian Convery) and Atom Eve (Gillian Jacobs) take on the vicious Viltrumite warrior Conquest (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Conquest is ostensibly on Earth to prepare the world for Viltrumite, er, conquest, but as he explains repeatedly to Invincible, he really loves destroying and torturing things.
After Conquest seemingly kills Eve, Invincible, who has had both hands broken, absolutely loses it and bashes Conquest to “death” with his own head. Some might say this is sweet, sweet vengeance for Negan (also Morgan) famously bashing Glenn Rhee’s (also Yeun) head in on The Walking Dead, but it comes straight from the Invincible comics, which came out in 2009. So incredibly satisfying to watch if you want #Justice4Glenn, but also mostly just a nice coincidence.
In any case, Eve isnotdead and reveals – as fans who watched the Atom Eve Special learned – that when she’s put in moments of extreme stress, she’s able to get past the mental blocks that otherwise stop her from transmuting living matter, instead of just inert materials. However, eagle-eyed fans will also note that when she transmutes Invincible’s costume later in the scene when they’re about to have sex, it’s made of plants… So she may have broken through these blocks in a bigger way than she realizes.
The final conclusion of the episode, and the arc of the season, is that Invincible visits his half-brother Oliver in a hospital bed. And while Oliver thinks Invincible is going to tell him that killing is wrong… Invincible has decided that if anyone threatens his family again, just as Angstrom Levy (Sterling K. Brown) did in the previous episode, and Conquest this week, he won’t hesitate to kill them.
It’s a surprising move from the show, though again one pulled directly from the comic books, almost word for word. While the large majority of superhero media, from TV shows to movies, to the original comics wrestle with the “should heroes kill?” debate, Invincible has firmly fallen on the side of “yeah, when necessary.” Still, an ominous musical sting played under Invincible’s pro-death penalty statement points to more challenges coming the way of his realigned moral compass. So expect that this debate might not be as open and shut as the finale indicates.
Beyond that, the real eyebrow-raising moments are saved for that montage. So let’s break those Season 4 teases down, one by one.
Last seen in Season 2, Episode 6 “It’s Not That Simple,” the Sequids are incredibly dangerous Martian brain slugs who almost beat the Guardians of the Globe in their last encounter, including Invincible and Atom Eve. They had taken over the brain of an astronaut named Rus Livingston (Ben Schwartz), who was finally freed and brought back to Earth after a horrifying, harrowing ordeal. Unfortunately for Rus, after he returned to his apartment, which had been trashed by Shapesmith (also Schwartz), he threw up a Sequid in the sink – which immediately took over his body, again.
That plotline has been on hold since the aforementioned episode, but looks like it’s coming back in a big way in Season 4. While everything else has been going on this season, the Sequids have been steadily building an army in the sewers, including what looks like hundreds of human workers and others. Given we were told that if the Sequids ever made it to Earth it was game over for humanity… Yeah, that’s bad! “Not long now,” says Russequid. Uh-oh!
At the end of Season 3, Episode 4, “You Were My Hero,” the unstoppable Battle Beast was fighting a Viltrumite in the cold, dark reaches of space. We catch up to him here, as well as the scattered remains of the Viltrumite… BB is in suspended animation but is quickly picked up by an alien ship. And a few seconds after that, he wakes up, ready for battle. He wants “more!”
If things pan out on the TV show the same way they do in the comic, the ship was part of the Coalition of Planets, the group fighting back against the Viltrumites. Alongside Allen the Alien (Seth Rogen) and Nolan Grayson (J.K. Simmons), it looks like the Coalition finally has a fighting chance against the unstoppable aliens.
In one of the best casting coups on the show, the creepy, Cenobite-esque Technicians who fixed up Angstrom Levy, as first seen in Season 3, Episode 7, are voiced by Doug Bradley. You might know him better as Pinhead from the Hellraiser series. And in this teaser of coming attractions, we get to hear Bradley say somethingextremelyPinhead.
After revealing that Angstrom has a new arm thanks to them (Invincible accidentally amputated it last episode), Angstrom asks what they want in return. “Angstrom Levy, you have witnessed what our ambitions have done to our world, and what we have had to do to ourselves to survive here,” a Technician explains.
Angstrom thinks they want a new home, but the Technicians have other ideas. “That is only the beginning of the delights we will achieve together,” the Technician says. Now, the classic Hellraiser line is “We have such sights to show you” while the 2022 remake employed “greater delights await.” But come on, if you weren’t Leo Dicaprio pointing at the screen meme at that line, what are we even doing here?
In any case, to explain what the Technicians are up to is to spoil one of the great plot twists of the Invincible comics. Suffice it to say that they will tie into the action, and we have not seen the last of either Angstrom or the not-Cenobites.
Despite Invincible demanding Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins) show him Conquest’s dead body, it turns out that the dead body was a fake. In fact, Cecil has Conquest locked in a massive, underground chamber as the Viltrumite’s body reconstitutes itself.
Donald (Chris Diamantopoulos), Cecil’s right-hand man, protests that this is a mistake. And if you’ve read the comics, you know that Donald is correct: you cannot hold a massively powered Viltrumite like Conquest with mere Earth materials, no matter how secure Cecil makes the facility. Unfortunately for Cecil, as well as the world, in this case, Invincible was correct: Conquest should have been killed.
That brings us to the mid-credits scene. While everything else we’ve explained above happens in the comic books by Kirkman, Ryan Ottley, and Cory Walker, this scene is completely new. And in fact, it’s something Kirkman always wanted to do in the comics, but never found room for. Oh, and there’s a fantastic, surprise voice actor involved.
Right after the end credits begin, we cut to Damien Darkblood (Clancy Brown), the demon detective we haven’t seen since Season 1, Episode 4, “Neil Armstrong, Eat Your Heart Out.” In case you forgot – it aired back in 2021, after all – Damien was investigating Omni-Man, then set up by Cecil and sent back to Hell. As he was sucked down to the inferno, he threatened vengeance on Cecil… And that’s (potentially) what we’re seeing here.
Now missing his trenchcoat, Damien creates a summoning circle, which calls a demon lord voiced by none other than Bruce Campbell. And Damien hails to the king, baby, by bringing “the great beast… welcome news.” Damien explains that he has the means to restore the demon to his former glory, and the “infernal throne.” The key? A “surface dweller of great power, likes of which this planet has not seen for eons.” And furthermore, Damien explains that “his blackened heart will be bound to your service.” And how will they do that? By conjuring “him” to Hell.
In the comics, Damien Darkblood was even more of a blink-and-you-miss-him character than he was on the TV show. But as Kirkman explained to theCartoonist Kayfabe podcastin 2020, there was originally more planned.
“The thing that I really regret is I never had an adventure where the superheroes went into Hell,” Kirkman explained. “There’s been so many superhero comics where it’s like, they got to go fight Mephisto or something, and I was like, ah jeez, I never got around to that. And the Damien Darkblood character was there so I could eventually do a story like that, and I never got around to it.”
Part of the reason for this may be that the initial storyline and reveal of Omni-Man as a bad guy was supposed to go nearly double the length that it did in the comic. It ultimately came to a head in issues 12 and 13, versus the planned 25. That meant there just wasn’t as much room for Darkblood to be investigating Omni-Man, because… Well, there was nothing left to investigate. So credit to Kirkman and company for letting that planned story play out on the TV show in a way we never saw in the books.
The big question here is: who is Damien Darkblood referring to? Is it Invincible? Omni-Man? Cecil? We’ll know more when Season 4 of Invincible premieres on Prime Video.",1604,"The Invincible Season 3 finale aired on Sunday night.

"There’s no denying the Russo Brothers’ new Netflix filmThe Electric Statehas been the talk of the town since it debuted on Friday — and with the industry’s climate the way it is, fans have certainly been discussing itsuse of AI.

That said, Joe Russo, who alongside his brother Anthony directed Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, has defended the use of AI for voice modulation in The Electric State, claiming it was “something any 10-year-old could do after watching a TikTok video.”
""There’s a lot of finger-pointing and hyperbole because people are afraid,” Joe Russo insisted in an interview withThe Times. “They don’t understand. But ultimately you’ll see AI used more significantly.""
The filmmaker added that he sees potential in the technology. ""Also, AI is in its generative state now, where it has, as we call them, hallucinations. You can’t do mission-critical work with something that hallucinates,” Russo said. “That is a reason self-driving cars haven’t taken over, or why AI surgery is not taking place worldwide. But in its generative state, AI is best suited towards creativity.""
While many artists across a whole host of disciplines feel AI is actually the antithesis of creativity, it seems as though some of the studios are excited to use the tech when it’s ready to be implemented. Back in July 2024, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos claimed thataudiences “don’t care” if AI is used in the film and television programming they watch. Sarandos doubled down and asserted that the tech is ""a great way for creators to tell better stories.""
""Animation didn't get cheaper, it got better in the move from hand-drawn to CG animation, and more people work in animation today than ever in history,"" Sarandos said on the call. ""So I'm pretty sure there's a better business and a bigger business in making content 10% better than there is in making it 50% cheaper.""
For what it’s worth, not everyone seems to be embracing AI right off the bat. Last month,Marvel denied using AIto create teaser posters for the upcomingThe Fantastic Four: First Steps, despite one of the people in the imagery sporting a four-fingered hand.
The Electric State was directed and produced by Anthony and Joe Russo from a script by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, which was loosely adapted from a 2018 illustrated novel by Simon Stalenhag.

It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.

4TB for $259.99
The Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.
The Samsung 990 Evo Plus does not have a preinstalled heatsink. However, the 990 Evo Plus SSD is a newer single-sided SSD design that is power efficient and doesn't generate as much heat as SSDs from before. That means you probably don't need to use a heatsink and it should still work perfectly fine in a PS5 console without any thermal throttling. That said, you certainly could for peace of mind and I wouldn't see any disadvantage to that aside fromspending an extra $7.

"Star Wars Hunterspublisher Zynga has announced plans for the game to shut down entirely just nine months after it was released, and it appears plans to launch a PC version of Steam are scrapped.

The NaturalMotion-developed, free-to-download team-based battle arena game launched on Nintendo Switch and iOS and Android in June 2024. IGN’sStar Wars: Hunters reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Star Wars: Hunters’ lighthearted PvP fun is like a party at the Death Star: Impressive for a bit, but probably not a place you’ll want to hang around for too long.”
It seems the review was prescient, asZynga announcedthat “after careful consideration” it had decided the final content update for Star Wars: Hunters across all platforms would be released on April 15, with the game remaining playable until October 1, 2025.
“We understand this news may be disappointing and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly,” Zynga continued. “Your passion and dedication to the game and its community have meant the world to us, and we are committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process.”
Here are the logistics: on March 25, Season 5 will be extended by three weeks. Zynga will re-run events and shop bundles from the Season, and the Ranked Season will also be extended, giving players more time to hit Kyber 1 rank.
On April 15, the game’s final content update will be released for free and in-game purchases will be disabled across all platforms. New Support Hunter, Tuya, will join the game as part of the final update. Tuya will be available and playable for all users immediately at no cost, along with a slate of additional in-game content. Zynga will continue to run a final Ranked Mode leaderboard for players to compete in and run all battlefields and game modes in rotation.
And then, on October 1, online servers will officially shut down, and Star Wars: Hunters will no longer be playable beyond this point.
There’s no mention of the PC version,which was announced to launch on Steam in early access form this year, in the shutdown notice. Its Steam page now includes a notice that the game is “no longer available on the Steam store.”
Take-Two-owned Zynga is best known for mobile games FarmVille, Words with Friends, and CSR Racing, but with Star Wars: Hunters it branched out to console for the first time. Similarly, Star Wars: Hunters was meant to be the first Zynga-published game to launch on PC.
“The success of Star Wars: Hunters on mobile and Nintendo Switch devices has led to our decision to expand the game to PC,” said Yaron Leyvan, executive vice president, games, at Zynga, back in November.
“This is something our community of fans have been asking for and we are very excited to welcome even more players to Vespaara. This moment also marks a milestone for Zynga as we bring one of our games to PC for the first time.”

"When I was in high school, I would stay up ‘til all kinds of ungodly hours of the night playing PC games. I even stayed up five days straight once, just to get to the end of Baldur’s Gate II ‘Throne of Bhaal,’ but what fascinated me about PC games most was how inventive they could be.

One that struck my imagination powerfully was Red Faction, which caught my eye because it had some of the hallmarks of DOOM (a high-tech, first-person shooter set on Mars, you say?) yet it added an essential wrinkle; terrain deformation. Red Faction is set in the mines of Mars, and I could fire explosive weapons at walls, creating holes or destroying them, and even tunneling through rock to circumvent checkpoints. It was all about charting your own course and finding your own path to accomplish your goals. It was incredible.
Unfortunately, not a lot has been done with that idea in the intervening years, but when Rainbow Six Siege came out, the ability to freely climb and rappel up and down buildings, and shoot through or destroy walls and ceilings sent a delightful little tickle through my Red Faction-loving brain.
While Siege began as a far more focused (and less exploratory) affair than the old Volition shooter, that (and quite a bit more) is about to change with the arrival of the upcoming Siege X update. Apart from gameplay, graphical, auditory, and UI enhancements, it introduces what is shaping up to be a fantastic new permanent multiplayer mode: Dual Front.
In Dual Front, a predetermined seasonal Operator pool will dictate who you can play, and team sizes are bumped up to six per side. Instead of spawning directly inside (or outside) one target area, there are three large areas to choose from, each with its own objective, so your team of six will need to split up to focus on both defending and attacking different locations simultaneously.
While the scope has expanded, much of the great core gameplay remains the same. When a match starts, each team will spawn in their squad HQ and one of two locations in your team’s sector will start a countdown to a Defend mission. The     is true for your opponents, so each team will need to defend one spot while attacking another. How you handle that, and where you decide to go, is up to you.
What’s more, there is a neutral zone in between the mirrored zones held by each team, and extra objectives will appear there. Completing those objectives, such as rescuing a hostage and getting them to an extraction point, will give your team a big boost in the back-and-forth struggle for supremacy, so even if you fail to defend your first location or attack the enemy base, victory is still possible.
Since Dual Front expands the contested space so significantly, I was moving between attacking and defending to suit the team's needs, creating a more free flowing experience with way more variation between matches than your standard Siege match. What results is a fluid, chaotic mess I had a blast with.
The seasonal Operator pools will be updated every month, and because your squad will need to do a little bit of everything, you’ll have access to both Attacker and Defender Operators on the character select screen. When you die during a match, you’ll quickly respawn and re-select your Operator, so changing strategies on the fly to counter your enemies is a central (and delightfully fun) part of the game now.
Several times during my preview, it looked like my current (attacking) team was in a great spot, so I would rush across the map to help my other beleaguered comrades who were fighting for their lives to defend our own base objective. Sometimes, everything was as it seemed: I arrived in time, and our team brought home a victory. Other times, I got separated from my team only for them to be ambushed by reinforcements. Each match was tense, because in maps as large as Dual Front’s, it’s difficult to know where the enemy is until they become a capital “p” Problem.
Speaking of navigating larger areas, I should mention some of the new gameplay additions. You can now rappel around corners of buildings and even sprint while rappelling, so it’s easier to poke around and find ways to get inside structures. New fire extinguishers create concussive blasts and visual obfuscation when destroyed, gas pipes can be shot or damaged to create jets of fire before exploding and scattering fire around on the ground, and metal detectors can be disabled temporarily or permanently. Overall, it’s more fun to play in the space, and there is a lot more space to play in on Dual Front’s mirrored map.
Siege X also marks a shift in monetization. After the update, Siege will adopt a free-to-play model, and for casual versus competitive stuff, here’s the skinny: casual and onboarding playlists, unranked quickplay, and Dual Front are all free, and will grant access to up to 26 Operators and skins. Siege Cup and Ranked modes will be pay-to-unlock, and grant access to all 50 Operators. So if you are jumping in as a casual player, there are no barriers to entry, but new players who want to get more serious on the competitive side will need to fork over some cash. If you already have Siege, don’t worry; you will keep everything you have, and retain access to all modes (and as an added bonus, Siege players will get a badge showing off the year they started and a little bonus for each year of Siege they played).
Some other updates in the Siege X package include five modernized maps (Clubhouse, Chalet, Bank, Kafe, and Border), enhanced visuals, audio, first-person shadows, new menus, better player onboarding, the ability to inspect weapons, and a lot more. The dev team has also committed to introduce a new Operator (or remastering an existing one) each season, and a bunch more.
But all those enhancements pale in comparison to Dual Front, which is on track to become my favorite mode for Siege, and once Siege X launches, it’s likely to be the only mode I’ll play as Siege marks its upcoming tenth birthday in an incredibly fun way.",1047,"Siege X includes five modernized maps, enhanced visuals, audio, first-person shadows, new menus, better player onboarding, the ability to inspect weapons, and a lot more.

"A leaked image suggests Steam is coming to the Xbox PC app — and maybe consoles, too
byOli Welsh
Microsoft seems intent on tearing down the norms of game-industry competition between platforms. Not content with publishingprecious first-party games on rival consoles, it now looks as though Xbox is ready to link arms with the leading PC gaming platform, Steam.
The Verge reportsthat Microsoft briefly published an image on Thursday depicting a new, cross-device user interface for Xbox. A filter for “Steam” is clearly visible in the view of a user’s game library shown in the image.
The image was published in a blog titled “Opening a Billion Doors with Xbox” about Microsoft’s currentplatform-agnostic strategy. (Sample quote: “Our goal is simple: to make every screen in the world an Xbox.”) The image was apparently quickly removed by Microsoft after The Verge inquired about it.
The publication of the image seems to have been a mistake. Does it really indicate that Steam integration is coming to Xbox? And, in a world where every screen is an Xbox, what does that mean exactly?
It’s certainly not outlandish that Microsoft might seek to make users’ Steam libraries visible within the Xbox PC app in this way. The Verge’s sources said that Microsoft plans to make every game installed on a PC visible within the Xbox app, and other PC game launchers, like GOG, do this.
But there’s also a real chance that Microsoft is thinking of expanding Steam integration beyond desktop PCs. The image shows the new Xbox UI running on multiple devices: a laptop, a phone, a tablet, and an Asus ROG Ally handheld, as well as a TV. Xbox consoles are also pictured. This is consistent with Microsoft’s announced strategy tocombine Windows and Xbox experiencesin a new, unified UI that will reportedly feature on anXbox-branded PC handheld from a partner manufactureras early as this year.
Could Steam integration come to future Xbox consoles as well as desktop and handheld PCs? It’s far from fanciful to suggest it. Xbox chiefPhil Spencer told Polygon last yearthat he thinks console platforms should be more open, like PCs, and that he’s open to putting rival storefronts like the Epic Games Store — or, it follows, Steam — on Xbox consoles.
Windows Centralrefers to persistent rumors of a partnership between Microsoft and Valve to put Steam on the next generation of Xbox consoles — rumors that Polygon has also heard (but not verified). The next-gen Xbox consoles — a dedicated handheld, and a successor to the Xbox Series X — aresaid to be more PC-like devices, running on a Windows-based development environment.
Considering all that, it’s surprisingly easy to picture Steam as an integral part of Xbox in future. This latest image is likely a mock-up, and its publication was surely an unintended slip. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a sign of things to come.

"Wildgate is something new from former StarCraft 2 and Hearthstone vets
byMichael McWhertor
Developer Moonshot Games, which is part ofthe studio founded by former Blizzard Entertainment CEO Mike Morhaime, revealed its long-in-development debut game on Tuesday. It’s callWildgate, which its creators describe as “a crew-based first-person shooter.” That description seems to be underselling Moonshot Games’ ambitions for the multiplayer action game.
Wildgate, likeSecret Door’sSunderfolk, is actually a complex but compelling mix of genres. It’s a blend of team-based, first-person shooter gameplay, resource gathering, ship-to-ship combat tactics, subterfuge, and extraction, all of which combine into something that looks intriguingly chaotic and unpredictable.
InWildgate, players take on the role of Prospectors who plunder for space wreckage in pursuit of a McGuffin called the Artifact. Winning requires either escaping from the anomaly known as the Reach through the titular Wildgate, or by eliminating all the other Prospectors you’re playing against. There appears to a wide range of tactics at play. Prospectors can send out probes to survey the Reach in search of treasure and hazards; go on mining and loot expeditions; invade opponents’ ships to sabotage them; and engage in nail-biting ship battles during escape attempts.
There will be a variety of Prospectors, each with their own abilities and tools, and a range of ships to choose from. The Reach is procedurally generated for every game ofWildgate, which should help keep the action fresh every time.
“Wildgatewas designed for anyone that’s ever wanted to go on a daring space adventure alongside a fearless crew,” said Jason Chayes, studio head of Moonshot Games, in a news release forWildgate’s announcement. “Players are invited to work together and confront evolving cosmic threats – whether they’re mysterious hazards of the Reach – or presented by rival Prospectors. We’re counting on you to bring your best-laid plans… and hey, even if they don’t pan out for the win, we’ve found that some of our favorite experiences are the ones we least expect.”
A preview playtest forWildgatewill be available April 10-14, Moonshot and Dreamhaven, the sister studio to Secret Door, announced. The full game is expected to launch sometime in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Steam), and Xbox Series X.
“Wildgate rewards cooperation and tactical mastery in a way that realizes Dreamhaven’s goal to bring players together and help them create lasting memories,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and co-founder of Dreamhaven, in a statement. “Since every match of Wildgate plays differently, there’s tons for you and your friends to discover as you explore the Typhon Reach. Ship-vs-ship combat brings an element of chaos that makes for an especially fun time, and we’re looking forward to players experiencing it for themselves during the playtest.”
Dreamhaven was founded in 2020 by Morhaime two years after the veteran game developerleft Blizzard Entertainment after more than 27 years with the company. Moonshot is led by producer Jason Chayes (Hearthstone,StarCraft 2), designer Dustin Browder (StarCraft 2,Heroes of the Storm), and artist Ben Thompson (Hearthstone,World of Warcrafttrading card game).

"Testing the ergonomics of Nintendo’s new console
byRuss Frushtick
If you were handed aNintendo Switch 2, you might not initially realize it. Sure, it might feel a little bigger in the hand, but otherwise the experience of holding Nintendo’s long-awaited follow-up feels familiar, with all the pluses and minuses that go along with that.
Delving a bit deeper, though, the improvements do become apparent. You just have to hunt for them.
When in handheld mode, the Switch 2 is about an inch wider and a half-inch taller than the original Switch. This increased size allows the Joy-Con 2 controllers to hug the new 7.9-inch screen, which is also noticeably bigger than the original Switch’s 6.2-inch display. While playingMario Kart World, I really appreciated the increased screen real estate, allowing me to soak up the image of a cow on a motorcycle doing backflips over Donkey Kong. But I was surprised to find that the increased size really helped with the ergonomics of the device as well.
It’s no secret that the original Nintendo Switch was a one-way ticket to Hand Cramptown. I can’t say that the Switch 2 will alleviate all of the issues people had when playing games in handheld mode, but I have some hope. Because the Joy-Con 2 controllers are a bit longer, I was able to fully grip the controller without my pinkie and ring fingers dangling uselessly under the console. More fingers on the device itself means more support and therefore less wrist and hand strain when playing for long periods of time.
Unfortunately, this is entirely subjective, and someone with smaller hands might not have the same experience. In fact, Polygon’s Chelsea Stark felt that the comfort levels were pretty comparable between the original Switch and the Switch 2, but did note that she really felt the weight difference — the Switch 2 is about 34% heavier, weighing 1.18 pounds with both Joy-Cons attached.
I found the increased size of the new Joy-Cons to be beneficial in other ways. If you’ve ever played a multiplayer game using a single Joy-Con tilted on its side, you understand misery. On the Switch 2, that experience is measurably improved on a few fronts: For one, the added size makes it so the buttons and analog stick aren’t right on top of each other, and your hands aren’t quite so smashed together as they were when holding the teeny-tiny original Joy-Con. The tiny, rectangular trigger buttons in this solo Joy-Con mode are also elevated and far easier to press on the Joy-Con 2, so drifting inMario Kart Worldwill be that much more viable in this setting. Is it as good as holding your own dedicated controller? It is not. It still feels weird and offset, a consequence of the Joy-Con having to work for both handheld and solo play, but it’ll work in a pinch.
Size improvements have also been made to the analog sticks and face buttons, which are slightly larger than they were before. When using Joy-Con 2s in the new grip controller, it didn’t feel like I was totally hamstrung not having a full Pro Controller, like I would have been with the original Switch’s grip. I still don’t think I’d want to play a 60-hour Zelda adventure using just the grip — mostly because swapping between the right analog stick and face buttons still feels unnatural because of the way they’re stacked — but it might allow me to eke out some more play time before having to call it quits.
There are also more subtle differences that make using the Switch 2 far more enjoyable than the original. Connecting a Joy-Con 2 to the device using the new magnetic attachment feels incredible, as it clicks securely into place without the slight wiggle you might have felt with the original Switch’s rail system. There’s also a significantly stronger rumble hiding within the Switch, capable of boosting the feedback with a lot more fervor than before.
But with these improvements, it’s hard not to feel like there’s a pretty significant downgrade in comfort and playability when sticking with the stock Joy-Con 2s over, say, the new Switch 2 Pro Controller. If you play a lot of games, it does feel like the Pro Controller will be a mandatory purchase. Thanks to the new kickstand and the larger screen size, tabletop play does become a much more viable option than before. (It’s a good thing the Switch 2 will bebackward-compatible with the original Switch Pro Controller.)
After eight years, I was hoping more would have been done to make the ergonomics of the Switch 2 a dramatic improvement. The goal of allowing the Joy-Con 2s to function in a variety of circumstances (attached to the tablet, in one hand, sideways as a mini controller, and even as a mouse), probably has a significant impact on making something comfortable to hold for long periods of time. Which is to say: Third-party accessory manufacturers will once again swoop in with all sorts of zany grip solutions to make the Switch 2 a cushier experience. It’s just a shame that Nintendo wasn’t able to solve all of these problems on its own.

"Microsoft will bring Rockstar Games’Grand Theft Auto 5to Xbox Game Pass and GTA 5 Enhanced to Game Pass for PC on April 15.

This striking addition to the Wave 1 April 2025 lineup was announced in anXbox Wire post, revealing that the service’s biggest new title of the month is only a few weeks away from dropping. It’s an especially enticing reveal, as the PC Game Pass version of GTA 5 comes with that all-new Enhanced update Rockstar dropped in early March.
“No matter what version you’re playing, everyone will have access toOscar Guzman Flies Again, the latest update where you can take to the skies — taking control of the McKenzie Field Hanger in Grapeseed,” an official description from Xbox explained. “Play new arms trafficking missions, fly new aircraft, and more.”
Its arrival in two Tuesdays will mark a triumphant return to Game Pass after Rockstar’s open-world masterpiece was previously removed from the service. However, while the addition will mark the title's first time on PC Game Pass, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows as far as many die-hard GTA fans are concerned.
GTA 5 Enhanced arrived on PC March 4as a free update, bringing access to all the latest vehicles, performance upgrades in Hao’s Special Works, animal encounters, and visual bumps. It was a promising addition that also resulted in GTA 5 becomingRockstar’s worst-reviewed title on Steamas players latched onto account migration issues that kept them from bringing their GTA Online profiles over to the new version.
If you’re a newcomer to Los Santos, then you likely won’t have much to worry about. If you’re returning to the world of GTA 5 Online and looking to migrate your account over to that shiny new Enhanced upgrade, you might find yourself out of luck. For now, it appears the issues with account migration are still ongoing.
Meanwhile, we’re still waiting for any news aboutGrand Theft Auto 6. Our last GTA 6 update ensured thatRockstar intended to deliver its next open-world trend-setter sometime this fall, though we’restill waiting on that elusive release date.

"Nintendo revealed all of thejuicy details about the Switch 2during its April Direct. Theprice of the new consolewasn't too much of a surprise, but the reveal of the cost of first-party Switch 2 games at launch was definitely an eyebrow raiser. Most notably,Mario Kart World is going to cost $80on its own at launch. In addition to that, Nintendo is launching a new line of Switch 2 accessories that have gotten similar price increases compared to the original Switch.

The only Switch 2 accessory I was concerned about was the new Switch 2 Pro controller, which is now priced at a whopping $80. I already have multipleSwitch Pro controllersat home and would prefer not to  have to buy a new version. Thankfully, Nintendo confirmed in its developer interview that the original Switch Pro controllerwill be compatible with Switch 2.
While many folks will choose to opt for the newer Switch 2 Pro controller, it's not going to be necessary for most games. If you already have a Switch Pro controller, you should be fine holding onto that so you can save $80 to spend on new games. If you don't already have a Pro controller and are planning on buying the Switch 2, the standard Switch Pro controller is still a cheaper option right now at $69.99.
It's possible these older controllers could sell out before the Switch 2 arrives to make room for the newer controller. Amazon already has a signifcant lack of stock and is currently only offeringthird-party alternatives. Alongside compatiblity for the regular Switch Pro controller, Nintendo has also stated that the original Joy-Con controlllers will also be compatible – though we generallyrecommend the Switch Pro controller over Joy-Confor most games.
If the only accessory you really care about getting your hands on is the new Switch 2 Pro controller, you're going to have to wait until the console launches. The new controller will be officially available alongside the launch of the Switch 2 on June 5. You should be able topreorder the new console starting on April 9, which is likely when the official accessories will also become available for preorder. The Switch 2 Pro controller will only be compatible with the Switch 2, however, so you won't be able to use it on the standard Switch.
Listings for the Switch 2 Pro controller have already started to go live at Walmart and Best Buy, but with no preorder date shown. Walmart also includeslistings for the Switch 2 gamesyou'll be able to preorder soon.

"Amazon has recently dropped the price on the2TB SK Hynix P41 PlatinumPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVME solid state drive (SSD) to only $124.99 shipped. The SK Hynix P41 Platinum is one of thefastest PCI-E 4.0 SSDs available, has DRAM cache, and is considerably less expensive than other comparable SSDs like theSamsung 990 Pro($168) and theWD SN850X($154). This is an excellent SSD for either your PlayStation 5 console or gaming PC.

Update:Price has dropped again from $129.99 to $124.99.
SK Hynix might not be as recognizable of a brand as Samsung or Western Digital among consumers, but make no mistake that they are a major player in the flash memory market. SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and one of the world's largest memory chipmakers and semiconductor companies. They supply components for many reputable brands you've probably heard of, like Corsair and G.Skill.
The Platinum P41 is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read speeds of 7,000MB/s and write speeds of 6,500MB/s as well as random read speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and write speeds of 1.3 million IOPS. The Platinum P41 also has a dedicated DRAM cache, Most SSDs at this price point lack any DRAM cache and instead rely on HMB, or system memory, to cover the shortfall. In terms of reliability and stability, th Platinum P41 has been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written. It uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips, both of which are manufactured in-house. SK Hynix warranties this SSD with a 5 year warranty.
The SK Hynix P41 Platinum makes for a great secondary SSD for your PlayStation 5 console since it performs well above Sony's minimum speed recommendation of 5,600MB/s. It's possible this SSD will run fine without a heatsink, but we like to err on the side of caution and would recommend you install one for peace of mind. Besides, you can get a perfectly adequateslim PS5 heatsink for just $7.
The Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.

"David Fincher and Brad Pitt are reportedly re-teaming to revive aOnce Upon a Time in Hollywoodsequel script written by original director Quentin Tarantino.

Details on what could eventually be a groundbreaking entry in Tarantino’s resume come fromThe Playlist, which says the Se7en duo is propping up the unexpected film to come to Netflix, continuing Fincher’s long-lasting relationship with the streaming giant. Should everything proceed according to plan, the currently untitled Once Upon a Time in Hollywood sequel would see Pitt return as stunt-double star Cliff Booth.
How such a script came into Fincher’s possession is its own wild story. The Tarantino screenplay is said to be an evolved version of a story previously known asThe Movie Critic, a project previously lined up to be the Pulp Fiction mastermind’s final filmbefore it was suddenly shelved last year. Tarantino was seemingly uninterested in letting the idea fade to black and is getting Fincher to bring it to life.
The Playlist’s sources say Netflix paid $20 million to acquire the screenplay with an expected $200 million budget and plans to shoot in California in July – just three months from now. No additional casting details have been confirmed just yet, but Leonardo DiCaprio is not expected to return as Rick Dalton. Fincher and Pitt are putting aside all other projects to focus on this new Once Upon a Time in Hollywood sequel.
Deadlinelater corroborated The Playlist's findings that a Once Upon a Time in Hollywood sequel is in development. Its sources say Pitt received Tarantino's blessing to present the script to Fincher, resulting in the wildly surprising project that is now in the works.
Once Upon a Time in Hollywood premiered in 2019 and is largely viewed as yet another outstanding entry in the Tarantino pantheon. That said, what could eventually be known as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood 2 has a lot to live up to. The original project came with an unambiguous ending that tied up its story with a brutal bow. However, much of its world has been explored elsewhere.
In 2021,Tarantino released a novelizationcovering the movie’s events while expanding upon its take on a 1960s California. It broughta few interesting revelations about Cliff Booth’s pastto the conversation, including an answer to whether or not the dog lover really did kill his wife as teased in the movie. It’s a book that will no doubt carry more meaning when the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood sequel finally sees the light of day, though it’s unclear just how important to the story it will be.

"Here's our first look at Nintendo's newly designedNintendo Switch 2game boxes.

While the OG Nintendo Switch's game covers simply boasted a small Nintendo Switch logo in the top left-hand corner, the Switch 2's branding is far more prominent, with a red band stretching across the entire width of the case and a larger Nintendo Switch 2 logo.
There's also a change for Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives, too. While Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive game covers don't have any further information or branding on them, covers for games playable on both the original and Switch 2 systems all include a clear statement about Switch 2's upgrade information.
For instance, The Nintendo Switch 2 edition ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wildincludes the text: ""Includes the Nintendo Switch game and the Nintendo Switch upgrade pack. Upgrade pack also available separately.""
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games,some of which cost $79.99, clearly mark the boxes as such to let buyers know what they're getting.
You can see the new designs for yourself in the slideshow below:
There's now also a QR code on the bottom right of all game covers that takes you swiftly to the official Nintendo website.
At last, theNintendo Switch 2 has a release date. It's coming on June 5, 2025, with prices starting at $449.99. A bundle is also available withMario Kart Worldincluded for $499.99, although if you want to buy Nintendo's signature racer separately,it's $79.99.

"Amazon has the best deal right now on an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT prebuilt. You can pick up theSkytech Blaze4 RX 9070 XT gaming PCfor only $1,599.99 after a new $100 instant discount. That's a great price for a newly released GPU that stands toe to toe with an RTX 5070 Ti (or RTX 4080), which could easily run you well over $2,000 in this absurd market.

This Skytech gaming PC is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 7700 processor, Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU, 16GB of DDR5  RAM, and 1TB M.2 SSD. This is a pretty nicely thought out configuration, with a competent AMD processor and DDR5 RAM with an optimal DDR5-6000MHz speed rating. The AMD Ryzen 7 7700 features a max boost clock speed of 5.3GHz with 8 cores, 16 threads, and a 32MB L2 cache. You won't see much of a gaming performance uplift if you were to go for a newer Ryzen 7 or even a Ryzen 9 processor, especially at higher resolutions. Going by the photos, a 360mm aio liquid cooling system keeps CPU temps down. The entire system is powered by a generous 850W 80PLUS Gold power supply.
We rated the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT a ""perfect"" 10/10. Even though it costs $150 less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the 9070 XT beats it out in several of the games we tested. In a few benchmarks, the results aren't even close. The 9070 XT also has 16GB of VRAM, the same as the 9070 and 5070 Ti.
AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas
""PC Gaming has been in a decadent spiral since 2020, and the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is a reminder that it doesn’t have to be that way. This graphics card has no problem maxing out any game you throw at it at 4K, even with ray tracing enabled, and does so at a price that makes the competition look downright greedy. I can’t predict the future, so only time will tell if the launch price holds up. What I do know is we need more graphics cards like the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT.""

"Haworth is one of the major players in the world of luxury seating. It has recently partnered with Xbox and its Halo franchise to deliver compellinghigh-end options to gamers. I've spent a good amount of time with its Haworth Fern, trimmed in a unique gradient color, to see if it's worth your investment. Spoiler alert, it's fantastic.

Ergonomic chairs have a tendency to blend together, but the Haworth Fern is at no risk of being confused with anything else. It has a unique wave-like design and open lumbar channel revealing its fronds, lending it a very unique and stylish appearance. You can pick it up in mesh, leather, or knit fabric, with prices ranging from $1,100 to just under $1,900.
It’s a luxury chair through and through, but through a partnership with Microsoft, it has locked gamers squarely in its sights. It offers both Xbox and Halo themed versions of its flagship Fern chair, as well as an Xbox version of its Very gaming chair. These themed versions lock down your choices, but I've yet to see one that doesn't look good. None are overstated, but are also clear matches for their source material. You don't need to worry about losing features if you opt for one of these, however. They are the same in features and comfort as the personalized versions you can craft yourself.
If you decide to configure your own, there's a huge array of customization options. There are four fabrics to choose from: mesh, digital knit, gradient knit, and leather. You can pick from six different colors of mesh and eight for the digital knit, a soft fabric that textures the backrest with tasteful chevrons. Digital Knit takes the same fabric but exchanges the chevron pattern for a gradient that extends from the top of the backrest to the waterfall edge of the seat, and there are five to choose from. Finally, there’s leather, which is available in black, gray, tan, and “luggage” which comes in a camel-like desert brown.
There's quite an array of additional configuration options too. You can outfit the chair with a headrest and an additional lumbar support, choose between 4D armrests or limit them to height only, add forward tilt to accompany the default backward tilt, and decide whether you want a plastic or aluminum base, as well as the finish you would like. All told, it’s one of the most configurable chairs I’ve reviewed. There’s a handful of quick-ship options but most are stated to ship in around five business days. Tan and luggage leather options are made to order and take about three weeks.
No matter which material you choose, every Fern comes with a fabric, cushioned seat and offers the same basic array of ergonomic adjustments. Whether you’re choosing an entry-level version or are opting for a top-of-the-line executive chair, it’s designed to be comfortable and supportive for long hours at a desk, and is made to look every bit the luxury that it is.
It all starts with the backrest. The Fern uses what Haworth calls the Wave Suspension System. This encapsulates the entire backrest, which is actually multiple parts that come together into a cohesive whole. The core of the system sits between the plastic rear frame and the front face. Behind the fabric, supporting your back, is a flexible “cradle.” This is a skeletonized grid sculpted to match the contours of your spine and provide structural support. It mates with the “fern” from which the chair takes its name. This piece quite literally looks like a fern with a “stem” in the center that’s surrounded by flexible “fronds.” The stem is a central channel for the optional adjustable lumbar support. The fronds are support leaves that work with the cradle to maintain targeted support as you sit and move throughout the day.
The Fern is considered a “high-back” chair, so the backrest reaches to the upper back. At 5’8”, it comes up to my shoulders. You can pick up an optional headset that mounts to the top and can move up and down but isn’t angle- or depth-adjustable. It truly does look like a wave and the contours guide you toward the center, aligning with the chair’s lumbar support.
Around the back, the “stem” area is open, giving you a peek at the chair’s internals. If you pick up the added lumbar, its polished aluminum handle lives here, so it’s a functional feature as much as it is an aesthetic one. I recommend getting it if your budget can stretch that far. The chair’s natural contouring is good but the lumbar provides firm, targeted support and is one of the biggest ways you can guarantee that it provides exactly what your unique anatomy requires.
The seat is well padded with formed foam. Its contours guide you toward its center, aligning with the chair’s lumbar support. It's not exceptionally thick but is padded enough to hide the frame and remain comfortable without fear of it becoming too soft over time. On the right side, you'll find a lever to adjust its height, as well as a crank to raise or lower the recline tension. Another paddle controls the tilt lock, allowing you to adjust the recline from being locked upright to a deep recline. It's not a full lay like you'll find with a gaming chair. However, it's perfect for kicking back with a controller.
The armrests come in clutch here. They offer a wide degree of adjustability, much more than your average gaming chair despite sharing the same four axis of adjustment. When it comes to width, they can be tucked right in to support your elbows when holding a controller in your lap or set wide and out of the way. The cushions are soft but resilient. You can lean into them all day long without making yourself sore. I also like that they attach to the frame in thick aluminum channels, so if you do choose to lay your weight into them, you don't need to worry about damaging the plastic.
The headrest is also adjustable, but it's quite simple. It's fairly thin and just moves up and down. It's best positioned between the neck and head and does a good job of offering support there, but it lags behind some competing high-end task chairs, like the Steelcase Gesture, that allow you to angle and depth in addition to height. It gets the job done, but it's far from a make or break feature.
The Haworth Fern is an excellent chair that justifies its high asking price. I’ve been testing it for some time and have put it through its paces over long work days and gaming sessions. In both cases, it has performed exceptionally well and my back has been pain-free throughout. I was sent a gradient knit version, and it’s gorgeous: easily one of the most visually interesting chairs of its type. There was a bit of a wait time as it was made to order, but it is now available with standard shipping. The craftsmanship, quality, and final aesthetic were much worth the wait. The Fern lives up to the hype.
As a rule, chairs like this are fairly simple. They don't take long to wrap your head around, and the controls, while very important to understand and adjust properly, are straightforward once you understand what they do. I still recommend taking the time to read up each and try out slightly different positions and tensions until it feels just right for your body.I was a bit of a Goldilocks with this review, especially when it came to recline tension, but now that it’s set, I really only need to adjust the height and armrests and am glad I took the time for that initial setup.
The controls for the chair are well laid out and easy to use. I like that the seat depth slider is on the opposite side from the other controls and is set back a bit so you have to be intentional about making that specific adjustment. I was less likely to unlock the seat by accident, which is always a pain since the adjustment is so core to your comfort in the chair. I also liked that I didn’t have to get up to make depth adjustments. During initial setup, it definitely made it easy to find the right position and sped up the process.
The materials and build quality are also excellent. The Fern competes with the heaviest hitters in this industry and stands tall: it lacks nothing next to the Herman-Miller Embody, for example, or the Steelcase Leap V2. I would rank it right alongside those flagship offerings without a moment's hesitation. Haworth also offers an excellent 12-year warranty on its chairs. So should anything go wrong or become damaged from normal use, you have an assurance that your investment is protected.
Over the course of this review, I sat in the chair for as long as 7 hours with minor standing breaks in between — without any time lost to assembly as it comes pre-assembled. I have used it reclined with a controller and sitting upright with a mouse and keyboard. I have typed tens of thousands of words, edited photos and videos, prepared spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations, and have generally lived a good chunk of my work life in the chair. And I have done all of that, gotten up, and moved on with my day without feeling any discomfort. It's a case where the chair is a fantastic match for my body.
Just as importantly, it has left me feeling very satisfied with it as my daily driver. I walk into my office and enjoy seeing it at my desk. I appreciate the small details and the high quality craftsmanship throughout its design. And that gradient is just a chef’s kiss when it comes to unique and modern styling, balancing aesthetic with professionalism in a way that’s as at home in a professional office as it is in a gaming den.
The only criticism I really have of it, apart from its high price, is its headrest. It really does feel like an afterthought. And because of the way in which it is attached, through a slit in the fabric of the backrest, it’s not something you can remove and replace. I'm happy it's there, but I wish it offered more adjustability and support.
Taken as a whole, it is fantastic, but there's no way around its high price. With that in mind, it's worth considering a chair like this as an investment in the quality of your work and gaming life. Even though it costs a tidy sum, broken up over the 12 years of its warranty, the yearly cost seems much more reasonable. While it certainly isn't for everyone, it's hard to argue that it's anything less than exceptional.
The Haworth Fern is availabledirectly from Haworthbeginning at $1,100 and extending to around $1,900. It’s available in mesh, Digital Knit, Gradient Knit, and Leather and in a wide range of colors and patterns. It is alsoavailable on Amazonfor a similar price; however, use caution if purchasing from third-party to ensure warranty coverage.
The Haworth Fern is exceptional in just about every way. It's comfortable, supportive, extremely well made and designed to last for years to come. It doesn't come cheap, just like other chairs of its caliber, but if you are looking for a chair that will return its investment in the quality of your daily desk life and pain-free time away, it's well worth considering.",1928,"Haworth Fern has a unique wave-like design and open lumbar channel revealing its fronds.

A gloriously good deal for a magnificent set of books. We've also seen plenty ofcomics, likeUltimate Spider-Man, and even select vinyl (also within the 3 for 2 promotion) included in the deals.

"No video games for you!Superbadco-writerSeth Rogenhas revealed that Sony foundJonah Hill's character so ""reprehensible"" that reps insisted he stay away from aPlayStationduring a video game scene in the now-beloved comedy.

“On Superbad, we were told that Jonah Hill’s character, Seth, was so reprehensible to the studio that they were like, there’s a scene where they’re playing video games and [Sony] was like, ‘Jonah can’t touch a PlayStation,’ ” Rogen told Rotten Tomatoes in a South By Southwest 2025 red carpet video.
“They were like, ‘We can’t have him interact with our products, because it’s too vile a character.’ And I was like, ‘It’s based on me, that’s very insulting.’ But we accommodated them, ultimately.”
Sony Pictures co-financed the film, so they had a lot of leverage over a few top-notch comics trying to make a generational comedy. Ultimately, instead of Hill’s Seth keysmashing his controller and yelling at the TV screen when he died in-game, Michael Cera’s character Evan can be seen playingThe Getaway: Black Mondayon PS2 in that scene. But fun fact: there’s actually a bit of a gag with one of Cera’s lines here. He mentions using an M16 assault rifle in the game — but The Getaway: Black Monday, a British cop game, doesn’t even include them in the weapons arsenal. Go figure.
Rogen was at SXSW to promote his new Apple TV+ seriesThe Studio, which had its world premiere at the festival just days ago.
Superbad also starred Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Emma Stone, alongside memorable cameos from Bill Hader and Rogen himself. Rogen co-wrote the script with Evan Goldberg and Greg Mottola directed.

There is something perfectly simple and catchy about the Wii eShop’s theme song. It’s been remixed and parodied, even becoming the perfect sketch fodder forNirvana the Band the Show. You’re probably already humming it right now.
While that music was so iconic, there is a surprisingly practical reason that later system shops, like the Nintendo Switch, didn’t feature a theme song. That trend will continue on Switch 2.
“Unlike back then, the eShop now has lots of videos that are showcasing the games,” Nintendo Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto said. “We didn’t want to intrude on that, so we don’t have music there.”
I asked this in an interview that took place after these same Switch 2 hardware developers did a longer press conference with a large group of press in New York on Wednesday. During that interview, another Switch 2 developer, Takuhiro Dohta, said Kawamoto had “strong feelings” about the eShop. Kawamoto followed up that he “probably booted the Wii Shopping Channel the most out of any application [on the Wii].”
Kawamoto did tell me the Wii Shopping Channel music still gets stuck in his head, which of course it does.
As for actual improvements to this quiet Switch 2 eShop, Kawamoto said on Wednesday his focus was performance.
“I wanted to make sure that it was a smooth experience. That the scrolling of the list doesn’t stall, that it’s very smooth, pages load fast,” he told the room in New York.
We’ll see more of the Switch 2’s eShop when the console launches June 5.

"Don’t hold your breath forThe Witcher 4. According to the developers at CD Projekt, it won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest.

Speaking in afinancial calloutlining projections of future profits, CD Projekt said: “Even though we do not plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026, we are still driven by this financial goal. And although it’s very ambitious, we stand a chance of achieving it within the given timeframe.”
That rules out a launch this year, which no-one really expected, a launch next year, which some had hoped for, and sets 2027 as the earliest The Witcher 4 will come out. But that’s if everything goes to plan, and as we all know, the video game industry has a hard time with its plans. Could The Witcher 4 end up being a 2028 game? It sounds possible.
Either way, 2027 at the earliest suggests The Witcher 4 may well end up targeting the next-generation of consoles, with Sony no-doubt working on its PlayStation 6 plans as we speak, andMicrosoft rumored to be targeting a 2027 release for its Xbox Series X successor and an Xbox handheld. But is it a cross-gen game, as Cyberpunk 2077 was when it released in December 2020?
If it is a cross-gen game, with a version for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, could The Witcher 4 end up working on Nintendo Switch 2? It seems unlikely at face value, but The Witcher 3 ended up on the Switch, so miracles do happen.
Here's what we know: The Witcher 4 is the first in a new trilogy of Witcher games set after the events of The Witcher 3. But rather than star Geralt as protagonist, Ciri is the main character this time around.
Speaking exclusively to IGN ahead of The Witcher 4 reveal, executive producer Małgorzata Mitręga said Ciri was “the very organic, logical choice.”
“It was always about her, starting from Saga when you read it in the books. She's an amazing, layered character. And of course, as a protagonist we said goodbye to Geralt previously. So this is a continuation. I guess for all of us it’s like she was meant to be. That was always her.”
In January, speaking to IGN as part of a wider interview on Netflix’s upcoming animated film,The Witcher: Sirens of The Deep,Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle backed CD Projekt’s decision, even though it sees Geralt take a back seat.
“I'm really excited,” he said. “I think it's a really good move. I mean, I always thought that continuing the Saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons, but mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because people, I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done.”
And in February,the director ofThe Witcher 4clarified that a new video featured the same in-game model of Ciri after some had thought her face looked different.

"Netflix's President of Games, Alain Tascan, is expecting a future generation that relies less on gaming consoles as major players like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo push forward with new hardware.

The lead of the streaming giant’s video game division shared his thoughts on how gaming fans might soon play their favorite titles during an interview withThe Game Businessthat took place following a Netflix presentation in San Francisco. During the event itself, Tascan was asked if the streamer had any intention of taking a crack at console gaming, but he’s not so sure younger gamers are even interested in what something like a PlayStation 6 could bring to the table.
“[When it comes to] console, we started to look at the future where the platform is agnostic,” he explained. “Look at the younger generation. Are eight year-olds and 10 year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6? I am not sure. They are wanting to interact with any digital screen, whatever it is, wherever it is, even in the car. With console you’re thinking about high definition, you’re thinking about the controller […] If we look at this older model, I think it will restrain us.”
Tascan told The Game Business that he’s got a soft spot for console gaming despite his concerns, specifically calling out Nintendo’s Wii as a personal favorite. He’s spent many years at studios such as EA, Ubisoft, and Epic Games in the past, so the idea of more traditional console game releases is far from foreign for him. For Netflix, though, things are trending in a different direction.
While the company has a proven track record for creating game adaptations for its IPs with subscription add-ons like Stranger Things 3: The Game, Too Hot to Handle: Love Is a Game, and more, it’s also experimented with giving users access to notable, familiar games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition. Each game can be played straight from a mobile phone if a subscriber chooses, and as Tascan clarified during that recent event, Netflix will be doubling down on this strategy as it develops party games and establishes itself as a hub for kids and gamer families.
“I am very vigorous about lowering friction and eliminating it if we can,” he told The Game Business. “I see that the subscription is friction as well. Maybe good friction because it makes business sense, but still we did the test of eliminating subscription for [mobile game] Squid Game: Unleashed. And we may do other tests.”
He continued: “But the other friction is having enough controllers for family. Having a piece of hardware that might be expensive, that’s another friction. Waiting for a game to download, that’s another friction. I am [looking at] all the obstacles, and asking if we can reduce them as much as possible.”
Netflix said in early 2024 that games engagement had tripled throughout 2023, signaling that it would continue investing in the space in the future after a 2021CNBCreport suggestedless than 1% of subscribers were tapping into its gamesofferings. In October 2024, the streaming giant cut back on its gaming ambitions when itshut down its AAA studio headed by former Overwatch, Halo, and God of War developers. AGame Developerreport from last month said cuts had also recently hit Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, a teamNetflix picked up in 2021.
As Netflix seeks to tap into a market that it expects to be uninterested in game consoles, there’s little reason to doubt we’ll see something like aPlayStation 6ornext Xboxfrom Sony and Microsoft, respectively. Nintendo, meanwhile, is teetering on the edge of a brand-new console generation with itshighly anticipated Switch 2 device. It will pull back the curtain on its new tech with a focused Direct presentation next week, with many fans expecting to hear more aboutwhat features the Switch 2 brings to the table, its release date, andhow pre-orders are being handled.

Palworlddeveloper Pocketpair has one word on its mind, and it’s “beefy.”
During a conversation withIGNat the recently concluded Game Developers Conference, communications director John Buckley saidPalworldwon’t be coming to Switch because the open-world, crafting-focused Pokémon-like is “a beefy game.” A potential Switch 2 release, however, is “worth considering” if Nintendo’s next console is “beefy enough.”
“We haven’t seen [the Switch 2] specs yet,” Buckley said. “Like everyone else, we’re waiting. I’m walking around GDC hoping someone will tell me, but everyone I’ve spoken to says they haven’t even seen them. We did a lot of optimization for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with. Still work to do, but we’re really happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible.”
Palworldmadeheadlinesleading up to its January 2024 release due to its uncanny similarities with the Pokémon franchise both in monster designs and gameplay. The Pokémon Company eventually sued Pocketpair forpatent infringement, prompting an update toPalworld’s summoning mechanicsjust three months later. And while neither studio has said much about the legal proceedings in the months since,PC Gamerreports Buckley briefly addressed the controversy during his GDC talk.
“We did legal checks beforePalworldreleased and they were all cleared in Japan,” Buckley said. “So obviously when the lawsuit was announced we were like, ‘What?’ Pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge [Pokémon] fan, so it was a very depressing day, everyone heads down and walking in the rain.”

"The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card was released in late February for $749.99, but good luck finding one at that price. As with the rest of the Blackwell lineup, everyone from personal sellers to themanufacturers themselveshave joined in on theprice markup bonanza. Fortunately there's a way to get around these shenanigans, and that is by purchasing a prebuilt gaming PC instead. Amazon is currently offering CyberPowerPC and Skytech RTX 5070 Ti gaming desktops starting at $2,099.99. That's a reasonable price considering the fact that theRTX 5070 Ti has proven to be nearly identical in performance (within 5%) to the RTX 4080 Super.

Of all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and already marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled. Heck, even if you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti might be the better value than the RTX 50870 since both are equipped with the same 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM.
Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas
""At $749, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is the best 4K graphics card for most people, delivering much better value than either the RTX 5080 or 5090. Across my entire test suite, this GPU soared at 4K, coming within striking distance of much more expensive graphics cards, and that’s before taking multi frame generation into account, which will make the RTX 5070 Ti even better at hitting extremely high framerates, albeit with a hit to latency.""
Amazon has the best deal right now on an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT prebuilt. You can pick up the  for $1,799.99. That's a great price for a newly released GPU that stands toe to toe with an RTX 5070 Ti (or RTX 4080) for about $300 less than the least expensive RTX 5070 Ti prebuilt listed above.

"Nintendo has confirmed that those sleek new Switch 2 game cards won’t always carry an actual game and will, instead, sometimes simply contain a key for a game download.

The Super Mario Bros. company detailed how it will update its approach to physical game cartridges in acustomer support postpublished shortly after this morning’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. It explains that, when the Switch 2arrives this June, you’ll be able to carry on purchasing physical Switch games just as you’ve done for the last eight years, but there are a few things to keep in mind.
The post in question focuses on game-key cards: physical cards that only contain a key to download your chosen game. That means there’s no actual game data on the card you insert into your Switch 2, so you’ll need to download it once the card is inserted. Every game-key card case will be appropriately labeled on the lower portion of the front of the box, so if you’re concerned about what exactly you’re purchasing, you should have a heads-up right away.
News that Nintendo will utilize these game-key cards for Switch 2 has already taken hold of physical gaming fans who prefer the simplicity of plug-in-play without the need for lengthy download periods and an internet connection to get set up. The concern is that these are little more than fancy key holders that will soon replace all standard cartridges, but there are few reasons to believe this is actually the case for now.
Many have already taken to social media to point out that, while some early looks at Switch 2 box art, including covers for games likeStreet Fighter 6and theBravely Default remaster, do indeed feature that game-key card disclaimer, others, such asMario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananza, do not.
It appears the game-key card approach will likely be reserved for a few especially hefty games that might benefit from the key strategy, such as something like Hogwarts Legacy or Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Even then, developer CD Projekt Red hasalready confirmed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will ship with a game cardthat comes in at a whopping 64 GB on the Switch 2’s launch day.
Additionally, as explained during the Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo seems pretty proud ofthe new tech its upgraded red game cards support. They’re said to come with faster data reading speeds than what was seen with the original hybrid console from 2017, a fact the company wouldn’t need to point out if all of its cartridges were simple key containers. Let's not forget that Nintendo has bent the definition of what a game card offers before, with some notable original Switch examples beingLA NoireandNBA 2K18, which both required additional downloads out of the box.
It’s far too soon to tell just how many Switch 2 games will rely on game-key cards, but we know all will be revealed as launch draws closer. For now, the Nintendo Switch 2 is primed to click into action come June 5, 2025. For everything revealed during today’s all-encompassing Direct, clickhere.

"Havingfundamentally transformed the X-Men franchiseand debuteda brand new incarnation of the Ultimate Universe, writer Jonathan Hickman is gearing up for his next great Marvel epic. Today Marvel Comics revealed new details about Imperial, a four-issue event series that promises to reshape the fabric of the wider Marvel Universe.

Similar to how 2023's Ultimate Invasion paved the way for the ongoing Ultimate Universe line, Imperial is designed to shake up the status quo for Marvel's cosmic characters and lay the foundation for a new line of comics. In this series, many of the traditional power players in the Marvel Universe will be destroyed or overthrown, leaving room for new empires to rise in their place. The series will specifically center around the Hulk family, Black Panther, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Nova Corps, and other cosmic kings and queens.
Imperial will be written by Hickman and drawn by Federico Vicentini (Miles Morales: Spider-Man) and Iban Coello (Venom). Hickman's Ultimate Spider-Man collaborator Marco Checchetto is drawing the covers for the series.
""I'm very excited about this project as I’m obviously a huge fan of all things Marvel Cosmic,"" Hickman said in a statement. ""The goal here is to kind of do what we did with the recent Ultimate line for all of our space titles, except having the setup book (Imperial) be more of an event than a world-building exercise (like Ultimate Invasion). The art team is killing it, and we’re all just very excited for what’s happening in this special corner of the Marvel Universe.""
Based on the cover and concept art revealed so far, we can infer certain things about the big changes coming in Imperial. It seems the Nova Corps will be decimated (again), while Star-Lord looks to play a central role in the conflict. It also appears that an entire family of Hulks will take control of the bloody world of Sakaar. And given Black Panther's presence in the story, it's a safe bet that the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda has a part to play in this conflict.
Imperial #1 will be released on June 4, 2025. Let us know your theories about the book in the comments below.

"Star Wars Hunterspublisher Zynga has announced plans for the game to shut down entirely just nine months after it was released, and it appears plans to launch a PC version of Steam are scrapped.

The NaturalMotion-developed, free-to-download team-based battle arena game launched on Nintendo Switch and iOS and Android in June 2024. IGN’sStar Wars: Hunters reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Star Wars: Hunters’ lighthearted PvP fun is like a party at the Death Star: Impressive for a bit, but probably not a place you’ll want to hang around for too long.”
It seems the review was prescient, asZynga announcedthat “after careful consideration” it had decided the final content update for Star Wars: Hunters across all platforms would be released on April 15, with the game remaining playable until October 1, 2025.
“We understand this news may be disappointing and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly,” Zynga continued. “Your passion and dedication to the game and its community have meant the world to us, and we are committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process.”
Here are the logistics: on March 25, Season 5 will be extended by three weeks. Zynga will re-run events and shop bundles from the Season, and the Ranked Season will also be extended, giving players more time to hit Kyber 1 rank.
On April 15, the game’s final content update will be released for free and in-game purchases will be disabled across all platforms. New Support Hunter, Tuya, will join the game as part of the final update. Tuya will be available and playable for all users immediately at no cost, along with a slate of additional in-game content. Zynga will continue to run a final Ranked Mode leaderboard for players to compete in and run all battlefields and game modes in rotation.
And then, on October 1, online servers will officially shut down, and Star Wars: Hunters will no longer be playable beyond this point.
There’s no mention of the PC version,which was announced to launch on Steam in early access form this year, in the shutdown notice. Its Steam page now includes a notice that the game is “no longer available on the Steam store.”
Take-Two-owned Zynga is best known for mobile games FarmVille, Words with Friends, and CSR Racing, but with Star Wars: Hunters it branched out to console for the first time. Similarly, Star Wars: Hunters was meant to be the first Zynga-published game to launch on PC.
“The success of Star Wars: Hunters on mobile and Nintendo Switch devices has led to our decision to expand the game to PC,” said Yaron Leyvan, executive vice president, games, at Zynga, back in November.
“This is something our community of fans have been asking for and we are very excited to welcome even more players to Vespaara. This moment also marks a milestone for Zynga as we bring one of our games to PC for the first time.”

"Look, we get it. You're busy. Things are happening onlineconstantly. You can't stay up to date on everything, all of the time. And that even means that you occassionally will miss a trailer or preview for an upcoming movie.

But worry not, because we've got a round-up of some of the biggest trailers of the past week that you can watch right here. From a return to the John Wick universe in Ballerina to the next film from Paul Thomas Anderson to Happy Freakin' Gilmore 2, scroll on to check them all out...
Adam Sandler finally returns forHappy Gilmore 2on July 25 on Netflix. That's only 31 years after the original comedy classic! The first film's Julie Bowen, Ben Stiller, and yes, even Shooter McGavin himself, Christopher McDonald, also return.
This is just a 20-second teaser but it's for the next film from Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, etc.).One Battle After Anotherstars Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro, Sean Penn, and Regina Hall, and promises to be Anderson's biggest production yet. Here's the elevator pitch from Warner Bros.: ""When their evil enemy resurfaces after 16 years, a group of ex-revolutionaries reunites to rescue one of their own's daughter."" The film will hit theaters, including IMAX, on September 26.
John Wick may be dead -- long live John Wick! -- but that doesn't mean his universe doesn't continue on. Case in point, Ballerina (AKA the awkwardly named From the World of John Wick: Ballerina), which actually even has the Keanu Reeves character cameoing in it (since the film is a mid-quel set between John Wick 3 and John Wick 4). But really the one and only Ana de Armas stars as another assassin who also can dance! The second full trailer for the film debuted this week, but we also had anexclusive gallery of photosfrom the picture too. Ballerina hits on June 6.
This documentary is billed as ""an expansive and revelatory inside look at the 18 monthsJohn Lennon and Yoko Onospent living in Greenwich Village in the early 1970s."" The doc was shot in a reproduction of the New York City apartment where the famed couple lived and includes restored, never-before-seen material of Lennon's only full-length, post-Beatles concert (the One to One benefit concert from August 1972). One to One: John & Yoko opens exclusively in IMAX on April 11.
Eliois the next film from Pixar, the story of an 11-year-old (Yonas Kibreab) who can't wait to be abducted by aliens. Which, of course, he is. Specifically, Elio finds himself in the Communiverse, where he's mistaken for the leader of Earth, resulting no doubt in various misadventures. Other voice talent includes Zoe Saldaña as Aunt Olga, Remy Edgerly as Glordon, Brad Garrett as Lord Grigon, Jameela Jamil as Ambassador Questa, and Shirley Henderson as OOOOO. The film hits on June 20.
In theaters on June 13, A24'sMaterialistsis a romantic comedy starring Madame Web, Captain America, and Reed Richards... er, Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans, and Pedro Pascal. Here's the logline: ""A young, ambitious New York City matchmaker finds herself torn between the perfect match and her imperfect ex. The love triangle begins to have harsh and life-threatening effects on her clients as business mixes with romance."" But do they have superpowers?

"I think today might be the day my wallet throws in the towel. Woot is coming in hot with one of thebest PS5 game dealsI’ve seen all year, and Sony’s decided we’ve all earned a full-blown audio upgrade. Between the markdowns onnoise-canceling headphones,portable speakers, andhome theater gear, it's giving ""treat yourself"" energy with ""I won’t regret this at all"" delusion.

I want at least three of these, but I’m pretending to be financially responsible and only putting two in my cart. If you’ve been eyeballing anything fromhigh-end headphonestosmart display cases for your action figures (I meancollectibles), now’s probably the best time to stop window shopping and start adding to your cart.
This Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code ""IFPRZAZ"" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16"" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.
$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.
I think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.
If you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.
At $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.
$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.
This speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.
Crisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.
This speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.
Bass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.
XM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.
A wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.
My living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.
I didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.
This TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.
I want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.
This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.

"The GOG Preservation Program is growing with a solid list of inductees, including classic titles like Silent Hill 4: The Room, Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption, Fallout 2, Deus Ex, and more.

The PC digital storefrontdetailedhow it planned to expand its retro-gaming-focused service yesterday, providing fans with a lineup of games it has committed to support for the foreseeable future. It’s a list of 26 titles thatGOG sayswill “remain playable in their best versions” that players can safely assume they’ll have access to for years to come.
Silent Hill 4: The Room is one title that will benefit from the GOG Preservation Program in more ways than one. In addition to securing its future, GOG says the entry’s status with the service means it comes with “missing content that was never available on PC before.” This includes the reintroduction of Hauntings, which spruce up that iconic Silent Hill atmosphere with spooky effects, such as flickering lamps and possessed telephones. Modern controller support has also been added.
F.E.A.R. Platinum, which waspromised last month, arrives as an especially nice addition, too, as its original developer, Monolith Productions, wasshuttered by Warner Bros. last month. As more studio closures occur and the industry leans toward a digital future, it’s a perfect example of what GOG aims to accomplish with the Preservation Program.
You can see the March 2025 additions to the GOG Preservation Program, along with discounts as part of the currentSpring Sale, below.
The GOG Preservation Program is a relatively new initiative from the CD Projekt Red-owned storefront that serves as the company’s commitment to keep a selection of games up-to-date and available for PC players. More than 100 games are supported through the program, and judging by today’s announcement, the list will only continue to grow.
""The GOG Preservation Program is our commitment to preserving gaming history,"" GOGsaid at the time of its reveal late last year. ""Through the program, players can trust that their games will always be up to date and ready to run on current and future PC setups.

"﻿If I have to buy another fucking Joy-Con, I’m going to scream
byCharlie Hall
Halfway through October 2021, my youngest daughter, just 7 years old at the time, came to me with concern in her eyes. TheNintendo Switchwouldn’t turn on, and its last few moments of operation were concerning. Something about a download that had just completed, she said, and a button that said “update.” That was the end of the line for that particular unit, but only the beginning of my troubles with a console that would proceed to try my patience until this very day — an experience that makes me loath to considerbuying the Nintendo Switch 2.
The Hall family had been victim to a technical snafu as old as mobile devices themselves: the dreaded low-power firmware update. That’s when a device, like an iPhone or a graphics card or a $250 red-and-black plastic hunk of shit, loses power while it’s upgrading its most important layer of software. Firmware refers to the pieces of code that tell a device that it’s a device and not a 398-gram brick, and as I took the tripartite console from my daughter’s tiny little hands — where it was cradled like a dead bird — I knew that it was a total loss. But that wasn’t the worst part.
Inside that black mirror of despair were dozens of tiny, furry neighbors — herdigital friends fromAnimal Crossing: New Horizons. The newisland backupfeature had only recently been introduced, and her idiot father hadn’t yet taken the time to perform the arcane rites required to save a Nintendo Switch game to the cloud.
Her friends were all dead, of that I was sure. So, too, was the bell-selling knickknack shop that she and her older sister had built from scratch before showing it off on the Polygon Twitch channel. My house, my wife’s house, thosedamnable ladders and bridges that took weeks to build, and, of course, the peach trees that we all loved so much… none of them were ever coming back.
Ultimately, it’s my fault. I’m the user here, and it was my error. But I get to beangry at Nintendofor not making something like backing up hundreds of hours of irretrievable gameplay, shared joyfully during the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, just a little bit easier, or — dare I say it — a feature that gets turned on automatically from the start.
Everything about the Switch is a quirk, and some of them are more obnoxious than others
But Nintendo doesn’t treat the cloud like other console manufacturers do. It doesn’t treat online storefronts like other console manufacturers do, either. Or onboard storage. Or game cartridges. Or online multiplayer. Or friends lists. Or televisions, for that matter. Everything about the Switch is a quirk, and some of them are more obnoxious than others.
While having our original Nintendo Switch replaced by a refurbished one set me back pert near $120, I’ve easily spent at least that much buying additional controllers over the years. Both of the Joy-Cons that shipped with our original Switch suffered fromJoy-Con drift, something that my children suffered through wordlessly for months before I realized it.
“What is happening to Mario?” I asked one day while watching the girls play in the basement.
“Oh, that’s just how the controllers work now,” said my oldest. I was incredulous. There is no scenario where I would accept anything other than absolute obeisance from a human input device, but here my kids were making do, trying to complete nefarious jumping puzzles with a joystick that was barely capable of walking a virtual avatar in a straight line. Suffice it to say that they eventually lost the taste for piloting the tiny red plumber — especially when it took the better part of two months to get our controllers back after being repaired under the warranty.
When the next two broke, I just threw them away. It wasn’t even worth a trip to the post office for me.
Today we’re in a better place, thanks. The girls both have healthy relationships with video game consoles like the Xbox Series X, with iPhones and iPads, and with Windows PCs, as well as a catalog of games that each of them can call home. But they remain literally afraid of the Nintendo Switch, a console that let them down multiple times for various reasons. I can’t even coax them to bring it along for road trips.
They won’t forget that experience, and I won’t either. And that’s why I’m waving off the Nintendo Switch 2. I’ve got enough to worry about in the year of our lord 2025 that risking a visitation from another wonky portable console isn’t even on my radar.

"You don't have to wait for the new 2025 LG TVs to drop to score a great deal on an older generation model. Right now, you can pick up a 202365"" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TVfor just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday. The LG Evo C-series of TVs have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVs, especially for 4K HDR movies and gaming.

The LG Evo C3 is a 2023 model, just one year behind the 2024 LG Evo C4. So what are the differences? Aside from the $650 price difference, not much. The most important trait -- picture quality -- is more or less identical. Where the C4 improves on the C3 are an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate.
OLED TVs are considered the best TVs you can buy right now. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, they offer better image quality, deeper blacks, better contrast ratio, wider color gamut, and super fast response times. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV are easily the best type of TV for viewing 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations.
The LG C3 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel and all four HDMI 2.1 ports for running 4K at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. It also supports variable refresh rate (VRR), auto low latency mode (ALLM), and DTS audio, which is good for people who still watch Blu-ray discs. The C3 is also much easier to set up than its predecessors; the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that drops the weight to a mere 36 pounds.
The LG Evo C-series TV is ourfavorite high-end 4K TV of 2025because of the brilliance of its OLED display along with a host of quality features that don't quite push it to the point of an excessively high price. This model brings better contrast and clarity than the previous year's already luminous LG C2. It’s a sight to behold, especially when you add in the deep blacks and well-balanced colors on the crisp 4K screen. Once you choose OLED, it's hard to go back to anything else.
The LG Evo C5 hasn't yet been released, butit was showcased during CES 2025. At least on paper, the improvements of the C5 seem to be incremental, with no major ground breaking updates that would make you want to hold off until its launch. More importantly, the C5 will probably release at a very high retail price which will take months to get down to a level that's competitive with other TV deals.

"You’ll have to wait until 2026, though…
byZoë Hannah
You read that right — there’s a brand-new Rhythm Heaven game,Rhythm Heaven Groove, coming to Nintendo Switch… in 2026. Nonetheless, fans are likely thrilled to have any update on any new game in a series that hasn’t had a new title since 2015 for the Nintendo 3DS.

In true Rhythm Heaven form, the game will have tons of mini-games inside, but all of the games will test your sense of timing. You might even have to practice polyrhythms!
The game was announced at Thursday’s Nintendo Direct, which streamed live just six days before the planned Switch 2 Direct on April 2. The Nintendo Switch 2 is slated for launch within 2025, so it’s likely thatRhythm Heaven Groovewill be compatible with both the original Switch and its successor.

"An unused 60 fps mode raises a lot of questions
byIan Walker
A programmer poking around the newly releasedXenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Editionon Switch has discovered references toan unused 60 fps modein the game’s code, fueling speculation of a potential upgrade on Switch 2 when Nintendo’s next console rolls around later this year.
Switch modder MasaGratoR shared a screenshot of theXenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Editioncode to X on March 19. Henotedthat this 60 fps mode is “implemented only partially” because it “causes weird issues” when activated.
“Gameplay is rendered every second frame, so even though it outputs 60 FPS you get in fact 30 usable frames,” MasaGratoRaddedwhen asked about the issues presented by the higher framerate. “Cutscenes sometimes are working fine, sometimes some objects are jittering like hardcoded to be 30 FPS, sometimes it’s again every second frame rendered.”
While it’s entirely possible this code is just leftover evidence of the developers at Monolith Soft trying to get 60 fps working on the original Switch, the Switch 2 specssuggested by leaksshould be more than enough to handle such a framerate boost. Nintendo has yet to say whether or not backwards-compatible Switch games will be upgraded on Switch 2.
Xenoblade Chronicles Xfirst launched on Wii U in 2015, somehow cramming a massive, roleplaying adventure into a tiny space andgarnering praiseas one of the best games on the doomed console.Definitive Edition, available on Switch since March 20, features improved visuals and new story content.

Warning!Potential Donkey Kong: Bananza spoilers follow:
In most key art associated with the game, we see Kong smashing a fist into the ground, throwing up a shower of rocks and rubble, with the purple, rock-like Odd Rock behind him. The image on the Korean website essentially showed the same, but with one key difference: Odd Rock is missing, and a young Pauline is holding on for dear life to Kong's necktie.
This is the first time Pauline's been acknowledged in any of the images, teaser trailers, or hands-on previews shown thus far, suggesting Nintendo was perhaps hoping to keep her appearance a surprise. Whoops!
More intriguingly still, Pauline's young age suggests Donkey Kong Bananza could be a prequel of some sort — although again, Nintendo's tight-lipped on that for now.
""I think Bananza is on track to be one of the most gorgeous Nintendo games I’ve seen,"" we wrote in ourDonkey Kong Bananza first hands-on preview. ""It really does take advantage of Switch 2's hardware — the environments are beautiful and DK’s animations are wonderfully expressive, and I left feeling like the next generation of first-party Nintendo games had truly arrived.""

"Blizzard is reportedly receiving a number of pitches for new StarCraft video games from Korean studios.

In an article brought to the internet’s attention by X / Twitter account@KoreaXboxnews,Asia Todaylisted four Korean companies who are reportedly competing with each other to develop new games based on the StarCraft IP and secure publishing rights: NCSoft, Nexon, Netmarble, and Krafton. Apparently some of these companies have traveled to Blizzard’s headquarters in Irvine, California, to make their pitches.
NCSoft, which is behind the Lineage and Guild Wars MMOs, is said to have pitched a StarCraft RPG of some kind (an MMORPG?). Nexon, maker of The First Descendant, has pitched a “unique” use of the StarCraft IP. Netmarble (Solo Leveling: Arise, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad) is hoping to make a StarCraft mobile game. And Krafton, the company behind battle royale PUBG and The Sims competitor inZOI, wants to make a StarCraft game “based on its own development capabilities.”
Of course, video game companies pitch other video game companies all the time when it comes to securing publishing rights and development contracts. And it may be the case that nothing mentioned here goes anywhere. But StarCraft fans will certainly take note of Blizzard’s reported interest in doing… something to expand the much-loved sci-fi universe, given how long it’s been since the last game in the franchise came out. Activision Blizzard declined to comment when contacted by IGN.
It’s worth remembering that in September, it emerged thatBlizzard was making a third attempt at developing a StarCraft shooter, with former Far Cry executive producer Dan Hay, who joined Blizzard in 2022, leading the charge.
The news came from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier while speaking to IGN’s Podcast Unlocked, below, about his recent book, Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment. Hay’s StarCraft shooter is mentioned in the book, and IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey asked Schreier if it’s likely to actually come out.
“If it’s not canceled!” Schreier replied. “This is Blizzard after all. Their history with StarCraft shooters is not good.
“Yes, that is a project that as far as I know is in development, or at least as of the time that I wrote this book was in development. They are working on a StarCraft shooter, StarCraft is not dead at Blizzard.
“The goal of the book isn’t to get a bunch of scoops about upcoming things. That wasn’t the purpose of this book at all, it was very much to tell a story and focus on stuff that had happened. But this felt like such an interesting and useful nugget to include because it really just shows you that Blizzard cannot quit StarCraft shooters.”
That was a reference to Blizzard’s infamous attempt to release a StarCraft shooter in the past as part of a bid to expand the StarCraft franchise beyond its real-time strategy origins.StarCraft Ghost, announced in 2002, was going to be a tactical-action console game in which you played as a deadly Ghost operative in the employ of the Dominion, but it was canceled in 2006 after a series of delays.
A second attempt to make a StarCraft shooter, codenamed Ares, was canceled in 2019 so Blizzard could focus onDiablo 4andOverwatch 2. Ares was reportedly “like Battlefield in the StarCraft universe,” but, like Ghost, fell by the wayside.
More recently, in November,Blizzard was spotted hiring for an “upcoming open-world shooter game,”with all signs pointing to it being a StarCraft FPS.
Things are slowly ramping up for StarCraft. Blizzard recently releasedStarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection on Game Pass, and announced a StarCraft crossover with Warcraft card game Hearthstone.

"Scarlet Witch actress Elizabeth Olsen has suggested she will not be in eitherAvengers: Secret WarsorAvengers: Doomsday.

Marvel Cinematic Universe fans had hoped to see The Scarlet Witch return following the events ofDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.
Warning!Spoilers for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Agatha All Along Season 1 follow.
Scarlet Witch apparently died at the end of the 2022 MCU film andfailed to make a dramatic return in Disney+ show Agatha All Along, much to the disappointment of fans.Olsen had saidshe’d be up for playing Scarlet Witch once again, “if there’s a good way to use her.”
Then,MCU boss Kevin Feige issued a tease that got Scarlet Witch fans excited. “We had Agatha Forever on Disney+ just now, and that series was great for us,” he said. “Since then, there have been a lot of questions about Wanda on fans' minds... So all I can say is that we're excited to find out when and how the Scarlet Witch might return.”
If that return to the MCU does happen, it apparently won’t be in Avengers. Speaking toThe Hollywood Reporter, Olsen insisted she won’t be in London for the filming of the Russo brothers’ two upcoming Avengers movies, Doomsday and Secret Wars.
Why? She wants to focus on her non-Marvel movies right now. Doomsday and Secret Wars will soon start shooting in London via back-to-back productions, whereas Olsen is about to film a pilot for FX drama Seven Sisters.
Is this a ruse? Could Olsen be offering a diversion in her response to The Hollywood Reporter’s question? It wouldn’t be the first misleading misdirection from a member of the MCU’s cast. Perhaps everyone wants Scarlet Witch’s involvement in Avengers to be a big surprise if and when it happens, and ruling it out in interviews will help.
Here’s what we know: Iron Man actorRobert Downey Jr. is set to return as Doctor Doom, andBenedict Cumberbatch returns as Doctor Strange in Secret Wars. Elsewhere, we have vague rumblings about who will turn up in the film, with everyone from The Fantastic Four to the Thunderbolts rumored to be in the cast.
All eyes will be on London to see which MCU stars are in town when the filming takes place. Expect plenty more reports from eagle-eyed fans to hit the internet in the coming months.
The MCU rumbles on regardless.Thunderbolts*comes out in May 2025, TV showIronheartis out in June, and Phase 6 kicks off withThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsin July.
Earlier this month,the Russo brothers said they see Avengers 5 and 6 as a “new beginning”that will lay the foundation for whatever comes next in Phase 7 of the MCU.
“The only thing I’ll say about the movie is this: we love villains who think they’re the heroes of their own stories,” Joe Russo said. “That’s when they become three-dimensional and they become more interesting. When you have an actor like Robert Downey, you have to create a three-dimensional, well shaped character for the audience. That’s where a lot of our focus is going.”
Avengers: Doomsday is currently set to arrive in theaters May 1, 2026 and Secret Wars arrives about a year later in May 2027.
Late last year, Feige teased the introduction of X-Men characters in the ""next few"" MCU movies. Feige told an audience at the Disney APAC Content Showcase in Singapore that fans would see “some X-Men players that you might recognize” in the next few MCU movies, but he stopped short of saying which characters or what movies.
On bringing the X-Men into the MCU, Feige added: “I think you will see that continues in our next few movies with some X-Men players that you might recognize.
“Right after that, the whole story of Secret Wars really leads us into a new age of mutants and of the X-Men. Again, [it’s] one of those dreams come true. We finally have the X-Men back.”
Feige has also said the X-Men will be an important part of the MCU’s future following Secret Wars. ""When we were preparing for Avengers: Endgame years ago, it was a question of getting to the grand finale of our narrative, and then we had to start all over again after that,” Feige said. “This time, on the road to Secret Wars, we already know very well what the story is going to be until then and afterwards. The X-Men are an important part of that future.”
In October, Marvel Studios added three untitled movie projects to its 2028 release schedule: February 18, 2028; May 5, 2028; and November 10, 2028. It seems increasingly likely one of these movies is X-Men.

"Valve’s masterpiece still carries the platform on its back
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
New Half-Life games make me do stupid things. WhenHalf-Life 2came out on PC, I trekked to GameStop to trade in my Xbox, controllers, and games. I had hoped to score hundreds in trade-in credit, but the associate discovered my console was soft-modded and quartered the quote as a result — barely enough to cover the game. It didn’t run very well on my parents’ eMachines desktop (as a console player at the time, I didn’t know what recommended specs were). I was very sad when a port of the game eventually came to Xbox.
Half-Life: Alyxlaunched on March 23, 2020, nearly five years ago. I actually had a solid gaming PC that could run it. However, I didn’t have a VR headset, which is a necessary component. I immediatelyhadto have one, ideally a model that wouldn’t leave a $1,000 crater in my checking account likeValve’s Indexwould. I ended up buying a refurbishedOculus Riftfor $250 or so, and over the course of a memorable week, I beatAlyx, then promptly returned the headset for a refund while my jaw was still on the floor from its incredible finale.
It wasn’t long until I bought the wire-freeQuest 2later in 2020, another questionable financial decision, but I kept this one. Then I replayedAlyxthe way that it was meant to be experienced, which is with roomscale movement — no headset-tracking base stations required. I could kneel down, turn around, and just generally feel like I existed in the world, without concerns of tripping over a cable tethering me to my PC.
These hoops were worth jumping through forHalf-Life: Alyx, and those of you who’ve played it would likely agree. I haven’t played a VR game since with as much graphical polish, as much atmosphere, or as much consideration for different play styles and varying levels of comfort with VR mobility. It’s also the best-paced game I’ve played in VR; it’s the only title I’ve wanted to keep playing beyond my “oh, I don’t feel so good” threshold, which is somewhere around the 30-minute mark.
While the end goal of most of its encounters is to shoot bad guys and creatures with guns,Alyxoffers more open-endedness to encounters and to exploration in general. Once you clear a room, you can practice thwipping and throwing items with your gravity gloves, play the piano, or gawk at the stellar quality of theliquid shaders in bottlesbefore you smash them on the ground. You can open cabinets, fridges, and more, stacking each item you pull out realistically on top of the others. Why you would want to do that is beyond me (also, I did this), but the point is that youcoulddo it.Alyxput you in charge of how you spent your time in VR, not the other way around.
It’s trite to say this five years after launch, butHalf-Life: Alyxfelt like a door being kicked open, revealing what’s possible in VR. And, with the backing of one of gaming’s most beloved developers, I considered its release a possible turning point for VR tech going mainstream. I just really wanted everyone to be able to try it.
VR headset adoption has grown exponentially since 2020, thanks to Meta’s somewhat affordable Quest lineup of headsets. ThePlayStation VR 2can now be used on PCs, no longer exclusively tied to the PlayStation 5 (and it’s $200 less than it was at launch,costing $399.99). But since owning a powerful, costly gaming PC is the other part of the equation, that growth hasn’t made it all that much easier for more players to try games likeHalf-Life: Alyx. I wish Valve would port the game to PS5 so PSVR 2 owners could play it there. But since it hasn’t happened yet, more than two years after the headset’s launch, I’m not holding my breath. Maybe Valve is prepping a version of the game for its oft-rumored wire-free VR headset “Deckard” that our pals atThe Vergehave written about. Or maybe it’s not.
While there have been other great VR-only games sinceAlyx(Horizon Call of the Mountain, Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR, Batman: Arkham Shadow, to name a few that swung for the fences), the virtual reality segment has struggled to keep up the pace with new, must-play games. That’s sad, though it makes me treasureHalf-Life: Alyxeven more. It was a huge gamble to release the long-awaited prequel to one of the most influential games in virtual reality, requiring hardware that very few had then, and still very few have today. To that end, every developer making VR games is knowingly making a huge gamble that may not pan out in their favor.
Sure, I wish thatAlyx’s story could be played directly on consoles and PC so that more fans can play the game, but without gravity gloves, that would spoil all of the fun. When or if that’ll ever happen isn’t for us to decide. So, go ahead, do a stupid thing and buy a VR headset just so you can playHalf-Life: Alyx, even if you return it right after (I won’t tell). The game is just$17.99during the Steam Spring Sale, which lasts until March 20.

"AliExpress has dropped the price of the professional-gradeXbox Series X Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Controllerto only $74.42 shipped after you apply coupon code ""IFP3TXY""in cart. That's a huge price drop from its normal $140 list price and nearly the same cost as a standard Xbox controller. Note that this is a Hong Kong or Japanese import model in new retail packaging, but you won't find it cheaper anywhere else. AliExpress also offers a 90-day return policy on this item.

The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core wireless controller is physically the same controller as the older generation Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, which retails for a much higher $180. That means that the Core controller retains all the integrated pro gaming features like adjustable-tension thumbsticks, wrap-around rubberized grip, and shorter hair trigger locks. It's a much superior option to the standard Xbox Core controller that the current gen consoles come with.
Aside from the color scheme, theonlydifference is that the original Elite controller comes with more accessories: extra sets of paddles, thumbsticks, D-pad, and a travel case. The Elite Series 2 Core doesn't come with any of those accessories. You can buy them separately as acomponent packfor $59.99, however if you do want the component pack, you'll save money by getting the non-Core edition right off the bat (see below).
AliExpress also just dropped the price on a new retail boxed (imported) Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 wireless gaming controller – component pack included – to $100 shipped. This controller retails for $180 and the lowest price we've ever seen for this controller stateside is about $130-$140.

"Final Fantasy VII Rebirthis now available at its lowest price so far.Woot is offering the game for $32.99for PS5, a significant drop from its regular price of $69.99. For those who have been waiting to pick it up, this is a great opportunity to do so at a significant discount, and potentially one of the best deals of the year.

It's hard to imagine the game dropping any further in price anytime soon, making this likely the best opportunity to buy it at the lowest price possible in 2025. With such a steep discount, I wouldn't be surprising if it sells out quickly, so if you're interested in picking it up, don't wait too long.
In our 9/10 review, Michael Higham called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth“a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth,” and “an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long.” While it takes some creative liberties in reimagining the classic, he described it as “thrilling and unexpectedly impactful.”

It's hard to imagine the game dropping any further in price anytime soon, making this likely the best opportunity to buy it at the lowest price possible in 2025. With such a steep discount, I wouldn't be surprising if it sells out quickly, so if you're interested in picking it up, don't wait too long. The game is available now on PS5 and Xbox One, and is expected to be available on PC and Mac in 2018."
"Here are the best deals for Wednesday, March 12. Highlights include a rare discount on a (used) PlayStation Portal accessory, Lenovo-exclusive price drops on PS5 DualSense metallic controllers, the first discount we've seen on the iPad Air with M3 chip, USB Type-C cables for only $2.99 apiece, Destiny-themed SteelSeries gaming headsets, and more.

Used: Like New Condition
Looks and functions as if it were new. Moderate packing damage observed during inspection.
ThePlayStation Portalhas never been discounted, but at least you can save on a used one.Amazon Resale(a rebranded Amazon Warehouse) currently has Used: Like New condition PS Portals in stock for only $158.70 shipped. It retails for $199 new, so that's a substantial 20% in savings. A Sony warranty may or may not be included, but Amazon Resale items benefit from the same 30-day return policy you get for buying a new item. We expect this item to sell out pretty quickly.
Lenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.
Amazon is offering a 6-foot INIU USB Type-A to USB Type-C cable for only $2.99 when you apply promo code ""C2ALZ6LN"" during checkout. You can add as many cables as you like and the discount should be applied to each and every cable. These cables are sheathed in nylon braiding for durability and can be used for both data sync and charging (Quick Charge 3.1A compatible). This is a great opportunity to stock up.
If you're thinking of jumping on the AMD bandwagon for your next upgrade, now is certainly the right time to do so. Alongside theRyzen 7 9800X3Dwhich debuted earlier this year, AMD has just released its two higher-end Ryzen 9 siblings in the Zen 5 ""X3D"" stack: the9950X3Dis available for $699 and the9900X3Dis available for $599. Collectively, these processors represent the best gaming chips across both Intel and AMD. Pure gamers should go with the 9800X3D and allocate their funds elsewhere; creators with deeper pockets and a penchant for gaming will benefit from the immense performance uplift on the new Ryzen 9 processors thanks to their increased core count and cache.
Thenew iPad Airsits in the middle of Apple’s tablet lineup, with better specs than the baseline iPad, but it’s not as powerful as the iPad Pro. That said, if you need more computing power in a tablet than what the baseline device above offers, the new iPad Air with M3 chip will likely suit you just fine.
As you can tell by the name, it has Apple’s powerful M3 chip, and it supports Apple Intelligence, unlike the baseline model. It’s also compatible with a new Magic Keyboard (see it at Apple) that has a row of function keys and a trackpad.
As part of its Spring Sale, SteelSeries is taking 40% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets. The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Desinty 2 in-game items.
As part of a generalHP Days Sale Event, you can score an excellent deal on a 4K-capable gaming PC. Right now, theHP Omen 25L GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super Gaming PChas dropped to $1,399.99 shipped after you apply $50 off coupon code ""HPDAYSPC50"". This is quite easily the lowest price we've seen for a prebuilt RTX 4070 Ti Super gaming desktop.
Amazon is offering a four-pack ofApple AirTagskeyfinders for only $64.49. That's over $35 off the retail price and only $16.10 for each AirTag. This is a very practical accessory for anyone who owns an iPhone and tends to lose small wearables like wallets, keys, or remotes.
4TB for $259.99
Samsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.
Apple's best earbuds are on sale today. Amazon is offering the second generationApple AirPods Prowireless noise-canceling earbuds for only $169.99 shipped, a savings of 32% and the best AirPods deal so far this year. That's about $20 more than theApple AirPods 4 with ANC, down from its usual $70 price premium. Between the two, the AirPods Pro is stillthe superior earbudsbecause it offers better sound quality and noise cancelation.
You can grab this 10,000mAh power bank for only $8.99 after you clip the 10% off and 40% off clippable coupons on the product page. We very rarely see 10,000mAh power banks listed for under $10 so grab this one while you can. This will charge a Nintendo Switch from 0% to 100% about 1.9 times.
For a limited time, Hulu is offering four months of Disney+ and Hulu Basic (Ad-Supported) Bundle for just $2.99 per month. The normal cost of this subscription is $10.99 per month. This deal only comes around a handful of times per year and worth it for just the Disney+ subscription alone.
Pick up a five pack of USB Type-C cables for a grand total of just $7.96 after you apply promo code ""UNWEXMFD"". That averages out to about $1.59 per cable. Lengths include two 3.3ft, two 6.6ft, and an extra long 10ft cable. They're all rated for up to 60W of USB Power Delivery and are encased in a durable braided nylon sheath.

"As Nintendo had teased, Nvidia has now discussed the custom GPU powering the Nintendo Switch 2, although it failed to go into the level of detail tech enthusiasts were hoping for.

In ablog post, Nvidia confirmed what IGN had reported earlier today from Nintendo itself: that its GPU enables AI upscaling via DLSS and ray tracing.
Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is an AI-powered technology that uses machine learning to upscale lower-resolution images in real-time, enhancing both performance and image quality in games.
There is a little more detail on offer here on the Switch 2’s GPU. Nvidia described it as a “custom Nvidia processor featuring an Nvidia GPU with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements.”
Nvidia continued: “With 1,000 engineer-years of effort across every element — from system and chip design to a custom GPU, APIs and world-class development tools — the Nintendo Switch 2 brings major upgrades.”
Those upgrades include up to 4K gaming in TV mode and up to 120 FPS at 1080p in handheld mode. Nintendo Switch 2 also supports HDR, and AI upscaling “to sharpen visuals and smooth gameplay.”
The new RT Cores bring real-time ray tracing, delivering “lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows for more immersive worlds,” Nvidia continued.
Tensor Cores, meanwhile, power AI-driven features like DLSS, “boosting resolution for sharper details without sacrificing image quality.”
Interestingly, Nvidia said the Tensor Cores also enable AI-powered face tracking and background removal in video chat use cases, “enhancing social gaming and streaming.”
During the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed the C button, which is used for new chat functionality that incorporates an external camera and the microphone in the Switch 2 itself. Nintendo made a point of saying the tech is smart enough to pay attention to the player’s voice and filter out background noise.
And here’s the big claim from Nvidia:
“With 10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2 delivers smoother gameplay and sharper visuals.”
There’s no detail on how it’s determined that graphics performance. It will no doubt be left to experts such asDigital Foundryto run the numbers once the Switch 2 launches in June.
Elsewhere, Nvidia said the Tensor Cores “boost AI-powered graphics while keeping power consumption efficient,” and the RT Cores “enhance in-game realism with dynamic lighting and natural reflections.”
Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) via Nvidia G-SYNC in handheld mode “ensures ultra-smooth, tear-free gameplay.”
In a hardware-focused roundtable Q&A in New York yesterday, attended by IGN,Nintendo representatives confirmed the Switch 2 uses DLSS, but did not specify which version of the tech, or whether it had been customized for Switch 2. It was a similarly vague response when Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2’s GPU is capable of ray tracing.
And what about the GPU itself? Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, chimed in to say Nintendo prefers not to get in the weeds on things like the GPU.
“Nintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec,” he said. “What we really like to focus on is the value that we can provide to our consumers. But I do believe that our partner Nvidia will be sharing some information.”
In January, the internet spotted a patent, filed July 2023 but published for the first time earlier this year,that described AI image upscaling technologythat would help keep video game download sizes small enough to fit on a physical game cartridge while offering up to 4K textures.

"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is one of my overall favorite games. I first started playing it back in 2020 like everyone else and have been started up a new island several times since then. The series is just so cozy and stress-free, and LEGO has done a great job of capturing that aesthetic. LEGO has released quite a few Animal Crossing sets as it continues to build up theLEGO Nintendo brand, but the one that I personally like the most has just dropped to its lowest ever price.

The LEGO K.K.'s Concert in the Plaza set has dropped down to only $41.20 as part of theAmazon Spring Deal Days Sale. That's a 48% discount that drops the price lower than we've ever seen it before.
This LEGO Animal Crossing set wasfirst released back in August 2024alongside the Fly with Dodo Airlines set and various new LEGO Mario options. Tthe price has only recently started to drop, and with this discount it'slower than it has ever been beforeon Amazon. It's unlikely we will see a lower price than this, even for Prime Day or Black Friday, so right now is a great time to buy if you've already been considering it.
The set itself is only 550 pieces, so it can be easily put together in an afternoon. The centerpiece of the set is the classic Plaza and Resident services where Tom Nook is usually located, but it also comes with K.K's driveable camper van, a café, and a little tree permanently stuck in fall. You also get a little minifigure K.K. Slider (guitar included), Isabelle, and Audie. AlthoughK.K. Slider songsare not included, you could always have them play in the background while you put it together.
LEGO has been fairly consistent in releasing new Nintendo sets each year. Last year there were several months where new LEGO Animal Crossing sets came out, and most recently we hadthree new sets arrive in January 2025. That being said, there are currently no new Animal Crossing sets that have been announced for this year. More may arrive in the second half of the year, but right now, there are still only 10 sets featured on theLEGO Animal Crossing page.",366,"The LEGO K.K.'s Concert in the Plaza set has dropped down to only $41.20 as part of theAmazon Spring Deal Days Sale.

"Ubisoft previously said Valve’s handheld wasn’t powerful enough
byOli Welsh
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Ubisoft has announced thatAssassin’s Creed Shadowswill be supported on Steam Deck at launch, despite previously saying that Valve’s handheld was not powerful enough to run the upcoming blockbuster.
In aposton the official Assassin’s Creed X (formerly Twitter) account, Ubisoft said, “Many of you have been asking about Steam Deck. We are happy to say that we are supporting Steam Deck at launch and are currently awaiting the level of classification from Valve. More info to come soon.”
By “level of classification,” Ubisoft is referring to whether Valve will tag the game as Verified or merely Playable on the handheld. To attain Verified status, games must run well on default settings, plus have controls and an interface that are well configured for the device. But Ubisoft seems confident enough to make Steam Deck support official.
It’s a surprising move, because as little as a month ago,Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ technology director Pierre Fsaid in a tech Q&Athat the game “will not be compatible with Steam Deck, due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC.”
Assassin’s Creed Shadowsis very much a cutting-edge, AAA production. It is not being released on last-generation consoles and thePC system requirementsdon’t even allow for ray tracing to be turned off. Getting it running well on the capable but relatively humble Steam Deck will not be an easy feat for Ubisoft’s engineers.
Until recently, the Steam Deck has been able to keep up with most recent releases. But this deep into the console generation, with support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One becoming a rarity, the three-year-old device is struggling to run new releases likeMonster Hunter Wilds— and it’s questionable whether it has a big enough user base for developers to actively support it. In that context, Ubisoft’s decision to support the device withAssassin’s Creed Shadowsis laudable, if not brave. It will be interesting to see how well the game performs on Steam Deck.

"Several of thenew 2025 Samsung TVsthat were showcased earlier this year atCESare now available for purchase at Samsung's official online store. Select Samsung Neo QLED and OLED TVs are currently in stock and they ship out immediately for as early as April 9-10 delivery. Alternatively, you can pick up select models at your local Best Buy. Not every TV has been released yet, but I expect more models to become available soon.

Samsung showcased several of their top models duringCES 2025. Here's a quick rundown of the biggest highlights. At the moment, exact pricing for each model is unknown.
Samsung revealed a total of six Mini-LED TV models for 2025, and three of the models are available for purchase starting today. The Neo QLED QN990F andQN900Fare true 8K TVs with some incremental improvements like the new anti-glare tech, the One Connect wireless transmitter box, and access to Samsung's Art Store, which was previously retricted to the Frame TVs. The Neo QLEDQN90F, QN85F,QN80Fand QN70F are the new 4K Mini-LED models. The highest end model is the QN90F and it will feature the same 165Hz refresh rate, Gen 3 processor, and anti-glare coating as the S95F. The mid-range QN85F will be Samsung's first 100"" TV.
The new OLED TVs - the S95F, S90F, and S85F - feature several incremental upgrades over its predecessors. The S95F, Samsung's flagship model, boasts a new NQ4 AI Gen 3 processor, a faster 165Hz refresh rate, an improved anti-glare coating, and an upgraded QD OLED panel that promises up to 2,000 nits of brightness. The S90F will also feature the Gen 3 processor, 144Hz refresh rate with VRR, and a QD OLED panel with up to 1,300nits of brightness (for TV models 55"" and up). TheS85Fremains the ""budget"" OLED TV with a Gen 2 processor and is the only model that's available now.
Not yet released
The Frame Pro will make its debut this year alongside the standard Frame TV. The Frame Pro finally features the superior Neo QLED Mini-LED panel for richer and brighter colors, a faster 144Hz refresh rate, the new anti-glare tech, and wireless hookups in the form of a ""One Connect"" box that can be stowed away discreetly. The standard The Frame TV will still be available too, at a significantly lower cost I assume.
Samsung QN90D (2024) Reviewby Jaron Schneider
Samsung’s 2024 mini LED QN90D is a very nice television that refines the interface and adds a host of new features that increase the value of the offering. It’s expensive, but the brightness, color quality, wealth of HDMI 2.1 ports, built-in gaming, and more make a solid argument to warrant the asking price.
Like just about everyone else in the industry, Samsung is going all in on AI. Samsung's new tech for 2025 is their ""Vision AI"", which can recognize the content you're watching, including specifics like the actors or setting, and display relevant personalized commentary in real-time. In addition, more TV models this year will be equipped with AI Upscaling Pro and AI Motion Enhancer Pro which work in tandem to optimize image quality on the fly. Other features include Active Voice Amplier Pro, which uses AI to isolate and enhance voices, AI Optimization, and AI Energy Mode.
Samsung is also decisively moving many of their TV panels to the matte-like anti-glare coating we saw on the S95D in 2024. This anti-glare anti-reflective tech doesn't desaturate like we typically see with anti-glare coatings from other brands, and yet reflections are minimized to the point that you'll never notice them..

"The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card was released in late February for $749.99, but good luck finding one at that price. As with the rest of the Blackwell lineup, everyone from personal sellers to themanufacturers themselveshave joined in on theprice markup bonanza. Fortunately there's a way to get around these shenanigans, and that is by purchasing a prebuilt gaming PC instead. Amazon is currently offering CyberPowerPC and Skytech RTX 5070 Ti gaming desktops starting at $2,099.99. That's a reasonable price considering the fact that theRTX 5070 Ti has proven to be nearly identical in performance (within 5%) to the RTX 4080 Super.

Of all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and already marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled. Heck, even if you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti might be the better value than the RTX 50870 since both are equipped with the same 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM.
Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas
""At $749, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is the best 4K graphics card for most people, delivering much better value than either the RTX 5080 or 5090. Across my entire test suite, this GPU soared at 4K, coming within striking distance of much more expensive graphics cards, and that’s before taking multi frame generation into account, which will make the RTX 5070 Ti even better at hitting extremely high framerates, albeit with a hit to latency.""
Amazon has the best deal right now on an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT prebuilt. You can pick up the  for $1,799.99. That's a great price for a newly released GPU that stands toe to toe with an RTX 5070 Ti (or RTX 4080) for about $300 less than the least expensive RTX 5070 Ti prebuilt listed above.

"As Nintendo had teased, Nvidia has now discussed the custom GPU powering the Nintendo Switch 2, although it failed to go into the level of detail tech enthusiasts were hoping for.

In ablog post, Nvidia confirmed what IGN had reported earlier today from Nintendo itself: that its GPU enables AI upscaling via DLSS and ray tracing.
Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is an AI-powered technology that uses machine learning to upscale lower-resolution images in real-time, enhancing both performance and image quality in games.
There is a little more detail on offer here on the Switch 2’s GPU. Nvidia described it as a “custom Nvidia processor featuring an Nvidia GPU with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements.”
Nvidia continued: “With 1,000 engineer-years of effort across every element — from system and chip design to a custom GPU, APIs and world-class development tools — the Nintendo Switch 2 brings major upgrades.”
Those upgrades include up to 4K gaming in TV mode and up to 120 FPS at 1080p in handheld mode. Nintendo Switch 2 also supports HDR, and AI upscaling “to sharpen visuals and smooth gameplay.”
The new RT Cores bring real-time ray tracing, delivering “lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows for more immersive worlds,” Nvidia continued.
Tensor Cores, meanwhile, power AI-driven features like DLSS, “boosting resolution for sharper details without sacrificing image quality.”
Interestingly, Nvidia said the Tensor Cores also enable AI-powered face tracking and background removal in video chat use cases, “enhancing social gaming and streaming.”
During the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed the C button, which is used for new chat functionality that incorporates an external camera and the microphone in the Switch 2 itself. Nintendo made a point of saying the tech is smart enough to pay attention to the player’s voice and filter out background noise.
And here’s the big claim from Nvidia:
“With 10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2 delivers smoother gameplay and sharper visuals.”
There’s no detail on how it’s determined that graphics performance. It will no doubt be left to experts such asDigital Foundryto run the numbers once the Switch 2 launches in June.
Elsewhere, Nvidia said the Tensor Cores “boost AI-powered graphics while keeping power consumption efficient,” and the RT Cores “enhance in-game realism with dynamic lighting and natural reflections.”
Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) via Nvidia G-SYNC in handheld mode “ensures ultra-smooth, tear-free gameplay.”
In a hardware-focused roundtable Q&A in New York yesterday, attended by IGN,Nintendo representatives confirmed the Switch 2 uses DLSS, but did not specify which version of the tech, or whether it had been customized for Switch 2. It was a similarly vague response when Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2’s GPU is capable of ray tracing.
And what about the GPU itself? Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, chimed in to say Nintendo prefers not to get in the weeds on things like the GPU.
“Nintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec,” he said. “What we really like to focus on is the value that we can provide to our consumers. But I do believe that our partner Nvidia will be sharing some information.”
In January, the internet spotted a patent, filed July 2023 but published for the first time earlier this year,that described AI image upscaling technologythat would help keep video game download sizes small enough to fit on a physical game cartridge while offering up to 4K textures.

"Helldivers 2has a new patch that makes key balance changes and bug fixes to Sony's third-person co-op shooter.

Patch 01.002.200 tweaks the balance on a number of weapons and stratagems. Developer Arrowhead also increased the number of AI calculations the game can perform, which primarily impacts scenarios with a high number of spawned enemies, improving their response times in those situations. However, this comes with a slight trade-off in game performance, Arrowhead said.
The upshot of these gameplay changes is that the Automatons specifically will present a tougher challenge as they now have increased reaction speed in large groups. Expect Helldivers 2's already imposing bots to act smarter and make decisions faster.
And here’s a useful improvement: the stratagem loadout menu has undergone an updated categorization of the different stratagem groupings.
Meanwhile, publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment announced Helldivers 2’s next Warbond, called Borderline Justice. The theme this time is 'space cowboy,' and in keeping with that theme there are new weapons including the R-6 Deadeye lever-action hunting rifle, the LAS-58 Talon ""revolver"" secondary, and the TED-63 Dynamite.
The GS-17 Frontier Marshal is space cowboy-themed medium Helldiver set, as is the GS-66 Lawmaker heavy armor, which comes complete with cowboy holster and bandolier. The Gunslinger armor passive gives your secondary increased reload speed, increased draw/holster speed, and reduced recoil. The warbond launches March 20.
Helldivers 2’s ongoing Galactic War is currently focusing on the Illuminate alien faction,which is slowly pushing a black hole towards Super Earth. Where this is going is anyone’s guess, but speculation points to potentially taking the fight to the Illuminate’s home world, or maybe finally fighting back on Super Earth itself.

"Amazon is hosting aBig Spring Salethis week (March 25-31), with deals on selectbooks,Blu-rays, toys, and more. Sure, some toys are meant for kids, but when it comes toNerf guns, LEGO (like theLEGO Wednesday Set) and beloved character plushies, I think anyone can enjoy these cozy collectibles.

I've rounded up the best deals I could find across popular franchises and characters, includingPokémon, TMNT, Disney, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and beyond. Whether you're buying for yourself or want to gift to a loved one, these cute plushies are affordable, adorable, and worth checking out.
One of the most popular plushie types sold these days is reversible plushies, giving you two sides of a character. It's essentially a two-in-one collectible, allowing you to switch up the expression you want to display based on your own mood on any given day. The TeeTurtle brand is one of the most common brands offering reviersible plushies, which is found above from Avatar: The Last Airbender, TMNT, and the Axolotl stuffed animals.
A personal favorite of mine is theInside Out 2 Embarrassed Character plush. I love the Inside Out movies and characters, and I appreciate the fact the plush is weighted for extra comfort and anxiety relief. Plus, it's only $14.40. In fact, most of these picks are below $15 with the exception of Kirby and Grogu!
TheSquishmallows Storeis loaded with fan-favorites right now on Amazon. There are select 10-inch Harry Potter plushies on sale, a cute lava lamp plush, a huggable Iron Man plush, and more squishy pals you can collect below during the Big Spring Sale.
AsPokémon toysremain popular, it's rare to see big Pokémon plushie deals on the most popular characters. That said, depending on the size and type you're seeking to find, there actually are some on sale this week, so don't miss out!
While Amazon is one of the more convenient places to shop, it isn't the only place where you canbuy popular plushies. Two of the best alternatives to Amazon are Target and Walmart, which will often have inventory when Amazon runs out. These two retailers also usually have more 20-inch versions in stock as well. For Pokémon fans specifically, you can also findPokémon SquishmallowsfromPokemon Center.

"Atomfalllooks like a hit, with 1.5 million players reached and, ahem, 300,000 cups of tea drank.

Rebellion’s brand new IP set in the north of England is the company’s most successful launch in its 32-year history, it said. Rebellion is the developer behind the popular Sniper Elite series of games, as well as the spin-off Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army entries.
Here's the official blurb:
“We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall,” said Jason Kingsley CBE, CEO and co-founder of Rebellion.
“To have surpassed the 1 million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off.
“We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series.
“We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game.”
While Atomfall launched simultaneously across PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series X and S and Xbox One,it also released on Game Pass as a day-one title, which will have significantly boosted player numbers.
Rebellion did not say how many copies of the game were sold, however, preferring, like Assassin’s Creed Shadows maker Ubisoft, to go down the player number route. But it did provide some fun stats to back up it announcement.
Over 316,000 Atomfall players, for example, have killed the scientist at the very beginning of the game. In total there have been over 3.7 million kills using the cricket bat, while over 4 million pasties and 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed.
IGN'sAtomfall reviewreturned an 8/10. We said: ""Atomfall is a compelling, post-apocalyptic survival story that satisfyingly bends to your choices and discoveries no matter which direction you take.""

"Thank your own personal deity—possibly Kratos—it’s Friday! Even though it’s Autumn for Aussies, it’s time to spring into ludicrous Spring Salesavings on Steam. If the picks of that litter don’t interest you, I’ve sniffed out console-based bargains on grand adventures, pulse-pounding action, or quirky indie gems; there’s a little something for everyone.

In retro news, I'm (somehow) celebrating the 23rd birthday of the OG Xbox, a console that blew my mind at launch (even though I was happily married to a PS2). This was the chunky vehicle that brought Microsoft into the console gaming world. And while it didn't have the prettiest design or the greatest library of games, it gave us two important contributions to gaming:Haloand Xbox Live.
While some N64 enthusiasts may argue thatGoldenEyepaved the way for quality console first-person shooters, it wasHalothat revolutionised the genre. Almost every FPS that came after Halo utilised its control scheme and a modified version of its health system. But where Halo truly succeeded was in providing console gamers with the first-of-its-kind 16-player LAN battles. This was the first shooter that made my PC gaming mates jealous, and I still own and adore myLimited Edition Crystal Xbox. Even though ants once tried to take it over and turn it into a very expensive vivarium.

"Pokémon Go, alongside Niantic's broader gaming division, was recently acquired by mobile gaming juggernaut Scopely. The $3.5 billion sale has players a little worried about what it means for the walk-around monster-catching game, and its director is trying to assuage those fears.

In anew interview with Polygon, Pokémon Go senior product director Michael Steranka discussed the sale to Scopely and what its plans are under theMonopoly Go!publisher. Steranka said he's been looking online at some of the player theories. ""What I would love to be able to get across is like, 'Hey, it’s actually great,'"" Steranka said. ""It’s going to be a good thing for the game and for the communities out there.""
Concerns over Pokémon Go's futurerun the gamut, from monetization and mechanics to influence from Saudi-based ownership. When asked about the potential for intrusive ads and playtime restrictions, Steranka said ""definitively no, that is not happening in Pokémon Go — not now, not ever.""
""Again, Scopely really recognizes how unique this game is, and they’ve told us themselves that they would be foolish to try to change the recipe of what’s made this such a huge hit and a success,"" Steranka insisted.
""So yeah, absolutely not. We will not be building into our games any type of obtrusive ads or anything like that. I just really want to reiterate Scopely as a company, the way that they operate is they give all of their teams the agency to make the decisions that’s right for their games. And that is not something that we feel would ever be right for Pokémon Go.""
Steranka went on to stress that the Go team does not sell player data to third parties, ""full stop,"" and that it only leverages location data for game operations, with any data needed stored on U.S.-based servers and following all ""incredibly strict"" regulatory best practicies as best it can.
Getting out and going outside will remain a core focus, too, even after leaving Niantic: ""And I would be remiss if through this transaction, Pokémon Go became Pokémon Stay at Home,"" Steranka said.

"Having launched in 2019, Apple TV+ is one of the youngest streaming services available today. Over the years, the Apple-owned platform has grown into a powerhouse of original TV shows, likeTed LassoandSeverance, as well as movies likeKillers of the Flower Moon. While it may not release new content at the same pace as something like Netflix, Apple TV+ is only a fraction of the price and comes bundled with just about every new Apple device purchase, making it easier than ever to check out its growing library. Below, we'll break down what Apple TV+ is as a service, how much it costs, and how to sign up for a free trial.

Apple TV+ offers a 7-day free trial for all new subscribers. Simply head over to theApple TV+ homepageor app and you'll be greeted with a button that says ""Accept Free Trial."" NewiPhones,iPads, Apple TVs, and Mac computers also come bundled with a 3-month Apple TV+ trial, which requires manual activation through the Apple TV app on the device. In both cases, once your trial ends, your subscription will automatically renew at the standard monthly rate of $9.99/month.
Apple TV+ is an award-winning streaming service featuring Apple Originals — exclusive series, movies, documentaries, and more, with new content added every month. While it was a bit barebones when it launched in 2019, Apple TV+ has grown its library to over 180 series, with breakout hits like Ted Lasso, Severance, and Silo, as well as over 80 original films, including Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. Apple TV+ was also thefirst streaming service to receive an Academy Award for its original film CODA, which released in 2022.
While Apple TV+ may not boast a massive library like Netflix, it's long maintained a ""quality over quantity"" approach when it comes to its original programming with something that will surely appeal to just about anyone, regardless of age.
Apple TV+ is one of the least-expensive streaming services at $9.99/month.Since there's no ads by default, there's no ad-supported or limited tiers to worry about.
Aside from standalone subscriptions, Apple TV+ is included in a bundled service calledApple One. The lowest-tier Apple One plan gives you access to four subscriptions: Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and a 50GB iCloud+ plan, all for $19.95/month. The Premier Apple One plan costs $37.95/month, adding Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, and an upgrade to 2TB of iCloud+ storage.
If you're a current college or university student, you can sign up for aApple Music plan that includes Apple TV+at a discounted rate of $5.99/month. Apple Music usually costs $10.99/month on its own, so this is quite the deal.
Treated as a separate subscription, Apple TV also hosts Major League Soccer streams. TheMLS Season Passstarts at $14.99/month, and Apple TV+ subscribers get a $2 discount.
Apple TV+ is available to stream on all of your Apple devices including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV set-top boxes. Additionally, you can stream Apple TV+ on a variety of internet-connected smart TVs, Roku devices, Amazon Fire TV devices, Google TV devices, as well as PlayStation and Xbox consoles.

Tucked in amongst a lot of dry business talk about sales milestones and long-term perspectives, CD Projektrecently confirmedto investorsThe Witcher 4won’t be released by 2026, pushing its potential launch window into the unimaginably far-off year of 2027 and beyond.
“Even though we do not plan to releaseThe Witcher 4by the end of 2026, we are still driven by this financial goal,” CD Projekt chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz said, referring to the company’s stated ambitions of pulling in a net profit of 2 billion złoty (around $515 million USD) from 2023 to 2026.
The Witcher 4wasfirst revealedsans release date atThe Game Awards 2024. A lengthy cinematic trailer depicted side characterCiri taking over as the series’ playable protagonistin place of long-time series face Geralt of Rivia.
“We’re kicking off a brand-new Witcher saga, this time with Ciri as the heart of the story!” game directorSebastian Kalemba said at the time. “It feels so good to finally be able to say those words — for the longest time we knew that we wanted Ciri to be the protagonist ofThe Witcher 4; it just felt natural to us and we believe that Ciri deserves it. In this game we want to explore what it means to truly become a witcher by following Ciri on her Path. This trailer is a taste of both that, and just how dark and grounded the world of The Witcher can be.”
The first entry ina new trilogy,The Witcher 4is one of three Witcher projects currently in development, a group that also includes a remake of the franchise’s 2007 debut and a multiplayer-inclusive project codenamed Sirius at Boston-based subsidiary The Molasses Flood.

"Sony and game developer Santa Monica Studio have revealed the Dark Odyssey collection, aGod of War Ragnarökupdate coming to players next week that features in-game equipment themed after one of the franchise's most iconic outfits.

Sony detailed all of the goodies included in its God of War 20th anniversary plans in aPlayStation.Blog post. Dark Odyssey is the real headline here, as it includes a war chest of cosmetic treats for all God of War Ragnarök owners across PlayStation 5 and PC. It’ll arrive as a free update March 20.
Everything included in Dark Odyssey features a clean, black-and-gold look that will no doubt have Kratos and co looking better than ever as they tear their way through Norse mythology. Atreus and Freya both receive their own cosmetic sets as part of the patch, too, as do a variety of the player’s shields and weapons.
The show-stealer, though, is a Dark Odyssey appearance and armor set for Kratos that hearkens back to a skin originally only rewarded to players who managed to beat God of War 2 on God Mode difficulty. Players can claim the content in any Lost Items chest in the base game or immediately in God of War Ragnarök’s roguelike Valhalla mode after the update drops. The patch will also finally introduce the option to customize the appearance of Kratos’ weapons without sacrificing each weapon’s respective ability.

Highlights include a collection of some snazzy social media assets (that you can downloadhere), an art showcase coming as part ofa collaboration with Los Angeles’ Gallery Nucleus, new merch, sales, multiple vinyl releases covering the franchise’s history, and more. You can pre-order a series of God of War vinyl collections as well as the 20th anniversary retrospective hardcover bookthrough the IGN Storenow.

"AndaSeatisn't as big of a name in the congested gaming chair market as some other brands like Secretlab, DXRacer, or Razer, but rest assured it makes somehigh-quality gaming chairs. Right now, there's anAndaSeat April Salegoing on with up to $220 off gaming chairs. These instant discounts stack with our 10% off IGN code ""AndaIGN"".

The Kaiser 3 offers great value for a high-end gaming chair that competes with other chairs that cost $500 or more. The base model currently costs $386.10, which is about $60 cheaper than the Kaiser 4, and shares most of the same features. You lose out on the 5D armrests and the lumbar is less adjustable, but that's about it.
In hisAndaseat Kaiser 3 review, Mark Knapp wrote that ""The AndaSeat Kaiser 3 makes some meaningful improvements to the series’ design, including a wide seatbase that does away with metal bolsters for hours-long comfort and a flexible lumbar support built in. It uses magnets here and there in a gimmicky but not useless way, and it offers all the premiums that one should expect at this price in a well-polished package. It’s not quite perfect, still suffering some from the aggressive racing-style design, but it proves a great chair nonetheless.""

For 2025, AndaSeat has just released a new line of gaming chair that's sure to be a hit with the budget-minded audience. TheAndaseat Novis gaming chair– which retails for just $199 – is now shipping. Even better, you can use our 10% off IGN code ""AndaIGN"" to drop the price further to $179.10. The Novis looks like it has most of the comfort, features, and styling of other high-end gaming chair minus some of the more common gimmicks (like ""4D"" armrests).
Use 10% off code: AndaIGN
The Kaiser 4 is AndaSeat's flagship chair. The price normally starts from $569 but this sale drops it to $476.10 after the IGN code. It's only available in Extra Large with a weight capabity of 395lbs so this is a very spacious chair. You can choose among eight different color options in PVC leather or two different color options in fabric. It has all of the creature comforts you'd expect in a quality gaming chair, like a unibody 2mm tubular steel frame, one-piece high density foam with a plush seat bottom (softer, in my experience, than the very firm Secretlab seat), four-way lumbar adjustment system, 5D armrests, up to 135 degrees of recline and a rocking toggle, included magnetic armrests, and more. This chair sounds a lot like the Titan Evo, and you'd be right; the design, features, and build quality are very similar, minus the price tag.
Overall, Mark Knapp didn't like it as much as the Kaiser 3, however. In hisAndaseat Kaiser 4 review, he wrote that ""The AndaSeat Kaiser 4 has great lumbar support and one of the best headrest pillows you'll find on the market, but its janky armrests are a major blemish on the overall design, and its firm seat won't be for everyone. If you have the AndaSeat Kaiser 3, everything but the lumbar support may feel like more of a downgrade than an upgrade – and if this is your first gaming chair, you can do much better within the premium market.""

If you don't care for the distinct styling of gaming chairs, Andaseat also recently released a traditional-style task chair model called the X-Air. It's also less expensive, with the standard model starting at only $341.10 after the coupon is applied. This chair features a softer suede-like material that feels more comfortable than traditional mesh chairs. It comes standard with plenty of adjustability, but you can upgrade to the Pro model to get the dynamic lumbar adjustment, 5D armrests, and a 3D headrest. The Pro model also comes in a couple of very unique colors.
Both the Andaseat Kaiser 4 and 3 are excellent gaming chairs that are on par with the quality you'll find from more expensive chair manufacturers. That said, if you're willing to spend substantially more,Secretlabis still ourfavorite gaming chair brand. Secretlab recently released its flagship Titan Evo chair in a ""Nanogen"" edition and it is, in our opinion, the new best gaming chair. In ourTitan Evo Nanogen Edition review, Chris Coke wrote that ""the Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen Edition deserves every bit of the overwhelming praise I’ve given. Granted, at $799 it’s significantly more expensive than the original and not far off from an entry-level Herman-Miller. But the return it offers in comfortable, supportive gaming is well worth the extra cost thanks to dramatically improved materials in both the fabric and multi-layered padding. The Titan Evo Nanogen Edition is class-leading, and is hands-down the most comfortable gaming chair I’ve ever used.""
Secretlab also released anew recliner add-onto anyone who already owns the Titan Evo chair, and it has turned out to be a very practical addition that's worthy of its lofty $200 price point. In ourrecliner add-on review, Chris Coke wrote that ""while both comfort and value are subjective things, the recliner is able to take the Titan Evo and transform it from one of the best racing style gaming chairs to standing head and shoulders above the competition at its price point. It’s novel enough that I wouldn’t be surprised to see other brands following suit in the near future. If you don’t mind paying for it, it’s an absolutely killer upgrade for your gaming chair.""

"It feels like we've been speculating for years about what the specs of Nintendo's long-rumored Nintendo Switch upgrade might be. Now that we finally know, the results are a bit more impressive than many would have thought, including supporting 120fps and up to 4K resolution when the system is docked.

In a segment during today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo showed off a number of elements of the system. For starters, the Nintendo Switch 2 has a bigger built-in screen than the Switch 1, at 7.9 inches. It's the same thickness (13.9mm), but with about double the pixels, supporting a 1080p screen in handheld at up to 120fps. And it's an LCD screen, supporting HDR. Docked, it can support up to 4K resolution and HDR as well.
The Joy-Con 2 controllers are connected via magnets and detached by pressing a release button on the back. The SL and SR buttons on the side are bigger, so they're easier to play with horizontally, and the left and right sticks are also larger. And this segment officially revealed the mouse control support in the Joy-Con controllers, too.
The handheld Switch 2 has a built-in microphone with noise canceling technology and 3D audio for compatible games. And it has a larger, sturdier stand than the Nintendo Switch that can be adjustible to different heights. There's also top USB port that can be used for external camera connectivity, or to charge the system while in tabletop mode.
Finally, we learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage.
The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, and will cost $449.99 USD, or $499.99 if you buy a bundle with Mario Kart World. You can catch up on everything announced at the Nintendo Direct todayright here.

"Nintendo has discovered QR codes
byTyler Colp
Friend codes continue to exist onNintendo Switch 2, but adding people will be slightly easier than it was on Switch 1, Nintendo confirmed to Polygon in a recent interview.
The heart of the friends list system on Switch 2 remains the same as it was on Switch 1. That’s why you can transfer it to the new console without much fuss. But the unique string of numbers that you have to punch in for every person you add is now optional.
You can scan a QR code with the Nintendo Switch phone app instead, vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen told Polygon. You can add notes for every friend too, which can help you remember who they are if they change their username.
Trinen said these improvements were important to make because of things likeGameChat, Nintendo’s Discord-like voice and video chat app. GameChat only works with your friends and even has a dedicated C button on the right Joy-Con. Trinen says the way it “replicates that face-to-face experience you get in the same room is crucial for what we want out of a chat system.”
In other words, Switch 2 won’t revolutionize how you add friends on Nintendo’s online service. You won’t be able to search for someone’s username and tap a button. You will need to find some other way outside of the console to share your friend or QR code with someone. Maybe when the third iteration of Switch comes out, Nintendo will join every other social platform in making this process less of a pain. But it won’t be doing that with Switch 2, which is set to launchin June.

"The Nintendo Switch 2 is finally hereand as previously reported the Switch 2 will be largely backwards compatible with Switch 1 games. However, there appears to be a concerted effort from Nintendo to introduce specially enhanced versions of Switch 1 games to the Switch 2. And these seem to go beyond just a graphical boost and framerate bump.

As Nintendo breaks down, there will be primarily three types of games playable on the Switch 2.Native Switch 2 gamesthat are developed for the system and cannot be played on the original Switch. Compatible Switch 1 games whose cartridges can slot right into the Switch 2 and be played natively on the console. And Switch 2 Edition games which are Switch 1 games that will receive new features and performance enhancements when played on Switch 2.
This doesn’t include classic games that are available through Nintendo Switch Online which includes a library of games from the NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and now GameCube.
The main takeaway from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is that Nintendo appears to be trying to throw in a little extra for anyone playing a Switch 2 Edition of a Switch 1 game.
For example, Super Mario Party Jamboree was a Switch game and the Switch 2 Edition will come with a new suite of content called Jamboree TV that will take advantage of the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, Switch 2 microphone, and the Switch 2 USB-C camera that will be sold separately.
Along with upgraded resolution up to 1440p in TV mode and better frame rate, there will be new minigames and online functions as well.
Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which will be a cross-gen game, will support mouse controls with Joy-Con 2, and multiple display modes like Quality Mode which runs at 60fps in 4K when docked, or 1080p at 60fps on handheld; or Performance Mode which runs a 120fps in 1080p when docked, or 120fps in 720p in handheld mode. All modes will support HDR.
Other Switch 2 Edition titles will get new story content like Kirby and the Forgotten Land’s Star-Crossed World add-on, whileThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdomwill gain additional support for the Zelda Notes service in the Nintendo Switch App that will give you guides and game help.
Some games, like Pokemon Legends: Z-A will only feature performance and resolution bumps as part of the Switch 2 Edition label.
The Switch 2 is set to be released on June 5, 2025 and that’s around when the first batch of Switch 2 Edition games will arrive.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will get Switch 2 Editions on the day of the console’s launch on June 5, 2025.
Switch 2 Editions for Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV will arrive a little later on July 24, 2025. Same for Kirby and the Forgotten Land’s update which will arrive on August 28, 2025.
Neither Metroid Prime 4: Beyond of Pokemon Legends: Z-A have release dates yet so both Switch 2 Editions are scheduled for sometime in 2025.
That depends. If you don’t own the Switch 1 version of the game, then you can purchase the Switch 2 Edition at retail, which will be distinct thanks to the new red-colored physical game case. The digital versions will also feature a prominent Switch 2 logo so you know you’re buying the right edition for your Switch 2.
If you own the game on Switch 1 and want the upgrades that will be added in the Switch 2 Edition you will need to purchase an upgrade pack from Nintendo. The upgrade packs will be available at select retailers, the official My Nintendo Store, and Nintendo eShop. However, Nintendo has not revealed how much an upgrade pack will cost just yet.
Some upgrade packs, like the upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom will be included in a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. This is the same membership that gives Switch owners access to online features and the classic library.
So there you have it, that’s everything you need to know about the Switch 2 Editions of a game. We’ve detailed previously how Nintendo is making thejump to the Switch 2 fairly seamlessthanks to its backward compatibility stance, and it looks like Nintendo is looking to bolster its launch library with improved versions of Switch classics.

"As a part of Microsoft's ongoing efforts toimplement artificial intelligence into basically everything, the company is preparing to introduce its AI Copilot into your Xbox experience to give you gaming advice, help you remember where you left off last time you played, and perform other tasks.

Announced today, Copilot for gaming will be rolled out for Xbox Insiders through the Xbox mobile app sometime soon for testing. If you're not already aware, Copilot is Microsoft's existing AI chatbot (that replaced Cortana in 2023) that's already integrated into Windows. The gaming version will have a handful of features at launch. You can ask it to install games on your Xbox for you (a process you can already do now just by pushing a single button on the app), and you can also ask it about your play history (in case you forgot what you were doing last time you played), achievements, library, or for a recommendation of what to play next. You'll also be able to speak to Copilot for Gaming directly on the Xbox app while you're playing, and it will serve you answers in the same way Copilot currently does when asked questions via Windows.
Probably the biggest use-cases touted by Microsoft available at launch is Copilot as a gaming assistant. You can already ask Copilot questions about games any time on PC, such as how to beat a boss or solve a puzzle, and it will source answers via Bing from various online guides, websites, wikis, and forums. Soon, you'll also be able to ask it those same questions on the Xbox app.
""Our goal is to have Copilot for Gaming source the most accurate game knowledge — so we are working with game studios to make sure the information Copilot surfaces reflects their vision, and Copilot will refer players back to the original source of the information.""
Unshockingly, Microsoft does not intend to limit itself to just these Copilot functions. In a press briefing, Microsoft spokespeople discussed other future possibilities for Copilot in video games, including as awalkthrough assistant to explain basic game functions, remember where items where left in a game, or tell you where to find new ones, or as a helper in competitive games that could offer strategy suggestions and tips in real-time to counter opponents' moves, or explain how and why an engagement unfolded the way it did. Though it was emphasized that these were both just ideas they were toying with, the presentation made clear that Microsoft is insistant on finding ways to integrate Copilot closely with regular Xbox gameplay. And Microsoft confirmed to me that it will eventually work with not just first-party studios, but third-party studios for integration into their games as well.
With that in mind, I asked Microsoft if Copilot gaming would be opt in or opt out of use, or if users could opt out of having their data used to train it. The answer is that yes, Xbox Insiders can opt out during the preview, but the door was left open for Copilot to be mandatory in the future. Here's what a spokesperson said:
""During this preview on mobile, players will be able to decide how and when they want to interact with Copilot for Gaming, whether it has access to their conversation history, and what it does on their behalf.
""As we preview and test Copilot for Gaming with players early, we will continue to be transparent about what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices players have around sharing their personal data.""
IGN understands that Copilot is not being limited to just player-focused usage, and that Microsoft will be providing an overview on plans for developer use in asession at the Game Developers Conference on Monday next week.

"Nintendo just revealed so much about the Nintendo Switch 2 during its latest Direct, but we have learned even more since the hour-long presentation ended, including the new console's tech specs. While we still have a lot of questions, let's break down what's new with the Switch 2.

This had been touched on before, butNintendo reiteratedthat this new system will feature a 7.9-inch wide color gamut LCD screen that is capable of outputting at 1080p (1920x1080). This is a big upgrade from Switch 1's 6.2-inch screen, the Switch OLED's 7-inch screen (although we will miss OLED!), and the Switch Lite's 5.5-inch screen.
There is also support for HDR10 and VRR up to 120 Hz, which means games can jump up to 120fps if they and your setup allow it.
It was also confirmed that slotting the Switch 2 to its new dock will allow games to be played in 4K (3840x2160) at 60fps or 1080p/1440p (1920x1080/2560x1440) at 120fps. We know these higher-end graphics are made possible by a ""custom processor made by NVIDIA,"" but sadly we are currently given no further details in regard to Switch 2's CPU/GPU.
What was revealed, however, was the battery life. The Switch 2's internal battery is a Lithium-ion battery with 5220mAh, and this will allow for approximately 2 - 6.5 hours of battery life and a charge time of three hours when in Sleep mode. Nintendo noted these are ""rough estimates"" and that the ""battery life will depend on the games you play.""
This battery life is just about the same as the launch model Switch 1 as it boasted a range of 2.5 - 6.5 hours. On the other hand, the Switch 2's battery life is a downgrade from the three newer Switch models - Nintendo Switch (4.5 - 9 hours), Nintendo Switch - OLED Model (4.5 - 9 hours), and Nintendo Switch Lite (3 - 7 hours).
Elsewhere, we learn that the Switch is approximately 4.5 inches tall x 10.7 inches wide x .55 inches thick with the Joy-Con 2 attached. This translates to a weight of roughly .88 pounds without Joy-Con 2 and 1.18 lbs with them attached.
The weight of the Switch 2 is an exact match for the current Switch 1 model, but it is both taller and longer than any current model with Joy-Con attached;
Speaking of Joy-Con, we sadly don't get the confirmation that they are using Hall Effect joysticks that would likely preventthe drifting issues many Switch owners experienced.They very well may use them, asit was hinted at in a patent from 2023,but we'll have to wait to find out for sure.
On the audio front, the Switch 2 supports linear PCM output 5.1ch. If you want a surround sound effect, that can also be enabled via headphones of the built-in speaker after a system update.
For storage, the Switch 2 will feature 256 GB of internal storage, which is another upgrade from the 32 GB available on the Switch and Switch Lite and the 64 GB on the Switch - OLED Model. Another big difference here is that the Switch 2 will require microSD Express cards for up to 2TB of extra storage, meaning the microSDXC cards the current Switch models support will not be able to be transferred over to the new console.
To wrap up, it was also revealed the Switch 2 will support Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi 6), it will have 2 USB-C ports, a 3.5mm 4-contact stereo mini-plug (CTIA standard), and a built-in monaural microphone with noice cancellation, echo cancellation, and auto gain control.

"Amazon is really jacking up the gaming deals in theirSpring Deal Days sale, giving you the limited-time chance to buy a new wirelessXbox controller from just £35.99. While some of the other selections are £4.50 more, the whole selection of colours available for these Series X|S controllers has had a price reduction, so you're getting at least 33% off whichever one you like most.

As a second or spare controller for your Xbox Series X or S console, along with supported games on PC, all those on sale at Amazon right now include the following colours:
Although the standard Carbon Black and Robot White—those bundled with the Xbox Series X & S consoles respectively—have been reduced to the lowest price of £35.99, all of the alternative colors have been dropped to a slightly higher yet still impressive £40.49. If you're in need of a new controller to play the newest games, likeCall of Duty: Black Ops 6which is on sale now as well, this is a fantastic opportunity.
You have to flaunt Amazon a little bit more of your cash to add a splash of style to your setup with one of these vivid color schemes likeAstral Purple, but it does seem worth it. What's more, these other models include the controller's updated design, featuring the X, A, B, and Y buttons being switched from their respective blue, green, red, and yellow colours to match that of their controllers' body.
The original button colours are still shown as tiny dots next to each one, but this update overall gives the controllers a more modest, sleeker appeal that arguably justifies the slightly larger price investment.
For those after a controller with a design that boasts more than one solid colour, Amazon UK also has the Special Fire Vapor Edition of the Xbox Series X|S controller as well,reduced by 20% to £51.99. Featuring titular vapor-like red-and-orange swirls, this bold colour scheme will invoke a little extra energy into your console setup if that's what you're looking for.

"For the last several years it’s felt like Nintendo just hasn’t cared that much about Donkey Kong. As Nintendo gifted pretty much every one of its cherished characters their best outingeveron Switch, the great ape who once stood high atop the girders of Nintendo’s essential arcade cabinet faceplanted hard on the concrete with a litany of ports, remakes, and remasters. But on Switch 2, Nintendo is finally giving one of gaming’s biggest icons the love he deserves with abrand new, flagship, launch window 3D action-platformer, and if the first 30 minutes we spent with Donkey Kong Bananza are any indication, Mario’s original rival is looking poised to stand tall once again.

It’s hard to talk about Bananza without referencing that darn plumber as just seconds after jumping into its Underground World, the significant parallels to Super Mario Odyssey became abundantly clear. While Nintendo hasn’t confirmed the developers of Bananza, after playing it we’re willing to bet Odyssey developer Nintendo EPD Tokyo is behind it.
Bananza’s setup will feel instantly familiar to anyone who’s spent hours throwing Cappy and collecting Power Moons. DK is joined by an adorable assistant (this time in the form of a purple rock who talks and sings) to scour self-contained explorable sandboxes for Golden Bananas, some of which are found by completing story missions while others are sprinkled across the landscape just waiting to be found. As you explore, you find isolated linear challenge rooms that dial back the exploration in favor of testing your combat and platforming abilities. There are other collectibles to find too, like gold presumably playing the role of coins, dozens of fossils (which we didn’t find a use for during our demo) and currency  we’re hoping will be used to outfit Donkey Kong in the local flavor. Even the UI is reminiscent of Mario’s globetrotting adventure! So if you were disappointed  the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct lacked a big, flashy 3D Mario, I'm here to tell you that Donkey Kong Bananza feels like the sequel to that formula we’ve been clamoring for, it just happens to star the giant monkey instead.
Like the best Nintendo games, Donkey Kong’s brand new moveset completely suits him as a character and feels right the moment you step into his shoes (okay, big hairy feet). Bananza is furiously fast and delightfully destructive as Donkey Kong can demolish most of the terrain in his path, and we spent our demo transforming the lush opening area filled with grass, trees, and lakes into DK’s personal chaotic excavation site. DK punches forward, upward, and downward, instantly destroying most materials and oftentimes carving a makeshift path to follow that can lead to entirely new areas. At one point I was punching through a mountain just for the heck of it and a valuable collectible fell into my lap, so there’s definitely value to breaking ground everywhere you can – it may lead to a groundbreaking discovery.
If pulverizing every stone wall in sight sounds overwhelming, it really didn’t feel that way in the moment, which is likely due to how much fun we had controlling Donkey Kong. In addition to turning everything to rubble, Donkey Kong can also pick up giant stone boulders from the ground, walls, or wherever, and hurl them to obliterate nearby enemies. Or, he takes a page out of Link’s book and can use the stone slab to boogie board at a rapid pace across the landscape. There are surely dozens of unique moves and chain combos waiting to be discovered and I can imagine how much fun speedrunners will have trying to master DK’s moveset, which already feels ripe with expressiveness and possibility.
Bananza’s central theme of exploration via destruction was present throughout every second of our demo, even down to the map screen. Instead of a simple top-down overview of the landscape, the map here is a fully-rendered 3D model of the entire areain its current state,meaning when you pause to get your bearings, you can see all of the walls you’ve punched and caves you’ve carved. It’s like the Hero’s Path feature in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom cranked up to 11, and it felt like an incredibly impressive touch.
That map helped us track down challenge rooms which rewarded us either with Golden Bananas or a ton of cash. And unlike Odyssey, there’s no more wondering if you have a Moon left to find and going inside to wait for Cappy to tell you, because the entrance to each bonus room tracks how many Golden Bananas you’ve found and how many more are waiting within. We saw three of these rooms in Bananza’s opening area, with each focusing on either platforming, combat, or destruction: we had to monkey bar our way through an obstacle course, take down three stone enemies before time ran out, and blast through as much gold ore as possible to take home a big payday. They were all fun and unique and left me excited to see what other challenges are in store.
I also think Bananza is on track to be one of the most gorgeous Nintendo games I’ve seen. It really does take advantage of Switch 2's hardware – the environments are beautiful and DK’s animations are wonderfully expressive, and I left feeling like the next generation of first-party Nintendo games had truly arrived.
Donkey Kong Bananza is out July 17 for $69.99, and I might destroy my entire house if I have to wait that long to play it again.

"Earlier this year, Dell rebooted the legendaryAlienware Area-51lineup of prebuilt gaming PCs, but until recently you could only configure it with one graphics card option - the RTX 5080. That's no longer the case. Starting now, you can choose to equip your Alienware Area-51 with an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU and - finally - an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 GPU starting at $5,499.99. Better yet, you won't have to wait months for your system to arrive; Dell estimates an early April ship date.

The $5,500 config might be the ""base"" configuration for an Alienware Area-51 gaming PC equipped with a 5090 GPU, but at that price, I would still expect stacked specs, and fortunately, this configuration delivers. It's equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU, 32GB of DDR5-6400MHz RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. TheCore Ultra 9 285Kis Intel's latest flagship CPU and offers stellar workstation and gaming performance. It's not quite the performance uplift we wanted from the i9-14900K, but right now there's nothing better from the Intel camp. The processor is cooled by a massive 360mm all-in-one liquid cooler, and the system is generously powered by a 1,500W 80Plus Platinum-rated power supply.
Dell unveiled the new Alienware Area-51 gaming PC at CES 2025. The chassis looks similar to the 2024 R16 system with aesthetic and cooling redesigns and updated components. The I/O panel is positioned at the top of the case instead of the front, and the tempered glass window now spans the entire side panel instead of just a smaller cutout. As a result, the side panel vents are gone, and instead air intakes are located at the bottom as well as the front of the case. Alienware is now pushing a positive airflow design (more intake than exhaust airflow), which means a less dusty interior. The internal components have been refreshed with a new motherboard, faster RAM, and more powerful power supply to accommodate the new generation of CPUs and GPUs.
The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 has emerged as the most powerful consumer GPU on the market. Although Nvidia has prioritized software updates, AI features, andDLSS 4 technologyto improve gameplay performance, the 5090 still boasts an impressive 25%-30% uplift over the RTX 4090 in terms of pure hardware-based raster performance. The 5090 also has more (32GB vs 24GB) and faster (GDDR7 vs GDDR6) VRAM compared to the 4090. This GPU is extremely difficult to find at retail price andis currently selling for $3,500-$4000 on eBay.
Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 FE Reviewby Jackie Thomas
""The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 has officially taken the performance crown from the RTX 4090, but with less force than previous generations. When it comes to traditional non-AI gaming performance, the RTX 5090 provides one of the smallest generational uplifts in recent memory. However, in games that support it, DLSS 4 really does deliver huge performance gains – you just have to make your peace with the fact that 75% of the frames are generated with AI.""

"22 years later, Nintendo is giving us the goods
byJulia Lee
At long last, it’s finally happened.Kirby Air Rideis getting a sequel:Kirby Air Ridersfor theNintendo Switch 2later this year.
We don’t know much about the game yet, but seeing the newly refreshed graphics is enough. The game is being directed by the man, the myth, the legend himself, Masahiro Sakurai, who also directed the original game (and is, y’know, Kirby’s original creator). Notably, this was the last Kirby game Sakurai directed, moving on to direct the Super Smash Bros. series starting withBrawlin 2008.
If you’re not hip to one of the best multiplayer games for the GameCube, let me break it down for you.Kirby Air Rideis a fast-paced racing game where you don’t press any button to accelerate — your warp stars and rides are running fast and hot on their own. You are controlling which directions the rides are going, and pivotal to any Kirby game, you can suck up enemies to copy their abilities and take out your allies. There’s beautiful winding paths, great music, and just overall great vibes.
But the meat ofKirby Air Ridethat set it apart from other racing games was its “City Trial” game mode, where you would be plunked down against three others in a huge city map, and you’ll have five minutes to collect as many power-ups as you can — and if you’re lucky, find the three parts of a legendary air ride machine. After those five minutes of chaos are up, there’ll be a match of some kind, whether it’s a race, a duel, a contest to see who can take out the most enemies, etc. Whoever wins that, wins the game! That being said, you don’t really know which mini-game will appear at the end, so your investment into a ride that can glide infinitely may be wasted when it turns out you have to fight King Dedede.
That being said, the new look forKirby Air Ridersdidn’t show off any new version of City Trial, but it’ll likely live on in the new title, as it’d be criminal to launch this game without it.
The best way to stay up to date on all things Nintendo Switch 2.

"Amazon quietly restocked a bunch ofPokémon TCG bundles just days agoand stock is already running low. These Scarlet & Violet sets have been MIA for weeks, and now they’re back at retail prices. I already added a couple to my cart,Surging SparksBooster Bundle,Shrouded FableETB and Paldean Fates Booster Bundle. Trainers need to snap these up quick. If they’re gone by the time you get there, that’s on you.

Looking for the least expensive PlayStation 5 console you can your hands on? As part of its US Anniversary Sale, AliExpress is offering an importedSony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Editiongaming console for $367.94 shipped after $80 off coupon code ""MAYUE008"". This is a brand new and retail boxed product that is stocked in a US warehouse and qualifies for local delivery, which means it ships free and arrives within about 1-2 weeks.
I also spotted a couple of power banks on sale from INIU and Anker. If you’ve ever watched your phone die mid-flight or mid-text, you know why I’m excited. These things are cheap, fast, and less annoying than asking strangers for a charger at an airport. Do with that information what you will. Oh, and while we’re on the topic of things I absolutely don’t need but definitely want: theGamera: Attack of Legionaction figure is up for preorder at the IGN Store for a cool $560, and Humble Bundle just dropped a massiveDragonlance book bundlethat practically dares you to add 25+ fantasy novels to your backlog for the price of lunch.
I want this bundle purely for the thrill of cracking six packs in a row and pretending I’m building a deck for Worlds. The Surging Sparks expansion is still new enough to feel fresh, and at $45.02, it’s a decent value compared to scalper prices that make you question your financial decisions. If you just want to dip into the latest set without going full collector mode, this is it.
Shiny Pokémon are back, and apparently so is my addiction to them. The Paldean Fates bundle gives you six chances to pull something sparkly, and while $69.94 isn’t exactly pocket change, I think the potential dopamine hit is worth the gamble. It’s in stock, it ships fast, and I’ve made worse choices at 2 a.m. on eBay.
I’m not saying this is the nerdiest thing you can buy today, but it’s definitely on the leaderboard. Humble Bundle just dropped a massive Dragonlance collection; 25+ books for about the cost of lunch. If you’ve ever wanted to get lost in magical twin drama, cursed artifacts, or the politics of dwarves (because who hasn’t), this is your sign. Plus, part of your purchase supports Room to Read, so now your TBR pile can come with good karma.
In my opinion, this is the one to grab if you're all-in on the set. Nine booster packs, a Pecharunt promo, themed sleeves, dice, and an actually-useful storage box? For $54.96? I’ve spent more on less at Taco Bell. Plus, it's still Prime eligible, which means you don’t have to sell your soul for free shipping. Win-win.
This is what happens when you give kaiju collectors exactly what they want: a 9.5-inch figure of LEGION fromGamera 2, complete with flying parts, glowing bits, and articulation that would make Spider-Man jealous. Sure, it’s $560, but I’ve seen statues half as cool go for double that. If you’re the kind of person who rearranges shelf space for something before buying it, I totally get it.
This thing charges your phone like it’s got something to prove. At $26.98, it gives you a full week’s worth of backup power and a built-in flashlight just in case you drop your phone and your dignity under your car seat. I want it purely because it has an LED readout that makes me feel like I’m operating a mission control panel instead of just charging my AirPods.
I think this is the best deal of the day, and not just because it’s $17.99. It’s slim, light, and can survive a drop better than my will to stay off social media. Anker knows what it’s doing, and this charger just works. No random overheating, no mystery ports, just plug it in and keep scrolling through whatever app is currently ruining your sleep schedule.
Hulu + Live TVoffers a three-day free trialthat allows you to take the live TV streaming service for a spin. This is one of the overallbest streaming free trialsbecause it gets you a bundle of services. It is quite a bit shorter than the standard Hulu free trial of 30 days, but it's a great way to test it out over the weekend.
With a 240Hz refresh rate, Dual QHD resolution, and 0.03ms response time, this 49-inch ultrawide OLED is built for high-performance PC gaming. The 1800R curve and HDR True Black 400 make it incredibly immersive, while FreeSync Premium Pro helps keep gameplay smooth and responsive.
This Android tablet comes with an S Pen included, a 10.4-inch display, and Samsung DeX for multitasking. At under $200, it’s a solid pick for casual gamers, students, or anyone who wants a lightweight, entertainment-ready tablet with productivity perks.
Celebrate Women's History Month with a killer bundle featuring female-led games. Titles include Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, Control: Ultimate Edition,Darksiders III,Beyond: Two Souls, and more. It’s a $160+ value for just $12, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity.
With a whopping 10,000Pa of suction, self-refilling, self-emptying, sonic mopping, and even hot-air mop drying, the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra takes hands-off cleaning to the next level. It's packed with AI features and even supports pet tracking and video calls.
Amazon’s newest Kindleadds color to the mix with a 7"" Colorsoft display. It still lasts up to 8 weeks on a single charge and now supports wireless charging and full-color highlights. It's ideal for reading graphic novels, cookbooks, or anything where visuals matter.
Enjoy spatial audio, active noise canceling, and up to 40 hours of battery life. These over-ear headphones are compatible with both iOS and Android, and support lossless audio over USB-C. A strong option for commuters, creators, and music lovers.
This Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code ""IFPRZAZ"" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16"" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.
$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.
I think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.
If you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.
At $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.
$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.
This speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.
Crisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.
This speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.
Bass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.
XM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.
A wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.
My living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.
I didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.
This TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.
I want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.
This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.

"The future of the MCU is starting to take shape. DirectorsAnthony and Joe Russohave teased howAvengers: DoomsdayandAvengers: Secret Warswill differ from their last two projects in the franchise, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.

During an interview with Brazilian outletOmelete, the directing brothers revealed that they see Avengers 5 and 6 as a “new beginning” that will lay the foundation for whatever comes next in Phase 7 of the MCU.
""The greatest thing that ever happened is we got to get immersed in a 20 movie arc and see an ending to that arc,"" Joe Russo said. ""What's compelling about these two new Avengers movies is they're a beginning. It's a new beginning. We told an ending story [with Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame] and now we're going to tell a beginning story. Who knows where we’ll go from there?""
The pair also opened up about how they ended up back in the Marvel world tackling another Avengers story. “We didn’t know what our road forward was in the MCU after we finished Endgame,” Anthony Russo explained.
“What happened was, a creative idea just came to us and that ended up feeling like the right idea. It motivated us to do it again. We feel like we have something fresh, we feel like we have a story that’s important and needs to be told. We have an amazing group of collaborators again, some old and some new. We’re very excited.""
He also noted that Doomsday is a “difficult” movie because of the “expectations on it” to help bring theatergoing back to its pre-pandemic glory. That said, the Russos also revealed it was Marvel producer Kevin Feige’s ideato bring Robert Downey Jr. back for Doomsday.
“That conversation was had a while ago, and Robert tried to talk us into doing it and we said no,” Joe said. “We just didn’t have a story, we didn’t have a way in, so we were resistant for a while. And then one day, [Endgame writer] Steve McFeely called us and said, ‘I have an idea.’ ”
“The only thing I’ll say about the movie is this: we love villains who think they’re the heroes of their own stories,” Joe Russo closed out the interview. “That’s when they become three-dimensional and they become more interesting. When you have an actor like Robert Downey, you have to create a three-dimensional, well shaped character for the audience. That’s where a lot of our focus is going.”
Avengers: Doomsday is currently set to arrive in theaters May 1, 2026 and Secret Wars arrives about a year later in May 2027, so unfortunately, we’ve got a lot of waiting to do before we can see what the Russo brothers are cooking up.
Late last year, Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige teased the introduction of X-Men characters in the ""next few"" MCU movies.
Feige told an audience at the Disney APAC Content Showcase in Singapore that fans would see “some X-Men players that you might recognize” in the next few MCU movies, but he stopped short of saying which characters or what movies.
On bringing the X-Men into the MCU, Feige added: “I think you will see that continues in our next few movies with some X-Men players that you might recognize.
“Right after that, the whole story of Secret Wars really leads us into a new age of mutants and of the X-Men. Again, [it’s] one of those dreams come true. We finally have the X-Men back.”
Feige has also said the X-Men will be an important part of the MCU’s future following Secret Wars. ""When we were preparing for Avengers: Endgame years ago, it was a question of getting to the grand finale of our narrative, and then we had to start all over again after that,” Feige said. “This time, on the road to Secret Wars, we already know very well what the story is going to be until then and afterwards. The X-Men are an important part of that future.”
It sounds like Phase 7 of the MCU will be dominated by the X-Men, then, but in the short term, Storm appeared inWhat If...? Season 3, marking the character’s first appearance in the wider MCU.
In October, Marvel Studios added three untitled movie projects to its 2028 release schedule: February 18, 2028; May 5, 2028; and November 10, 2028. It seems increasingly likely one of these movies is X-Men.

"While gaming has moved forward with bigger and more powerful consoles, theAtari 2600 Plusoffers a way to revisit the era of classic cartridge gaming. Right now, it'savailable for £50.13—half its usual price of £99.99—at its exclusive UK retailer, Amazon.

Released in November 2023, theAtari 2600 Plusmodernizes the original console’s design while maintaining compatibility with both Atari 2600 and 7800 cartridges. It connects easily to modern TVs via HDMI and includes a widescreen mode to better fit contemporary screens.
If you still have old cartridges like Space Invaders or Asteroids, they’ll run just as you remember. The system also comes with a CX40+ Joystick Controller, faithfully recreating the original’s design, along with a 10-in-1 cartridge featuring titles like Combat, Missile Command, and Yars’ Revenge:
For those looking to expand their collection, a second joystick is available separately for multiplayer games, and the 4-in-1 Game Cartridge Plus Paddle Pack adds titles like Breakout and Night Driver.
With its mix of nostalgia and modern convenience, the Atari 2600 Plus makes it easy to revisit classic games. And with this price drop, it’s a good time to pick one up.
In ourAtati 2600 Plus review, IGN's Seth Macy had this to say: ""Every time I walk past the Atari 2600+ sitting on the floor of my living room, controllers and games scattered around it, I'm instantly transported to the 1980s. Everything about its design is painstakingly authentic to the original while making necessary updates to bring it into the modern era. Atari collecting is easier than newer systems, but playing those carts has always been a bit tough since the original hardware was designed for an era when few TVs had coax inputs, much less composite video.""
""Being able to output to HDMI makes playing your original carts a snap, although seeing Combat on a 65"" 4K screen doesn't really add anything to the experience. The Atari 2600+ is a fantastic upgrade to the original hardware that stays faithful to the original where it counts the most. Part of me wishes it had wireless controllers, but the other part of me knows that would take away from the experience I remember as a little kid in front of a 13"" black & white tube television. And ultimately, the Atari 2600+ is about taking you back.""

"Secret Door’s digital tabletop game is almost here
byMichael McWhertor
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Sunderfolk, the ambitious co-op tactical adventure game built on a love of tabletop games, is coming to consoles and PC on April 23, developer Secret Door and publisher Dreamhaven announced Tuesday. Curious players can try outSunderfolkwith a first look demo through Nvidia’s GeForce Now game-streaming service from March 25 through April 7.
Secret Door’s debut title is inspired by tabletop games likeGloomhavenand Dungeons & Dragons, and uses smart devices as a controller, à la Jackbox games.Sunderfolkis designed to be played by one to four players on a large TV screen or monitor, with the game itself running on a PC or console. Players interact with the game throughSunderfolk’s dedicated controller app, which will be free to download for Android and iOS devices.
Sunderfolk’s creators hope their game will bring players together by bypassing the complexity and setup times required for learning new tabletop games. “Our goal withSunderfolkis to leverage modern technology tomake game night something everyone can enjoy,” said Chris Sigaty, studio head of Secret Door and veteran of StarCraft and Warcraft game development.
InSunderfolk, players choose from one of six anthropomorphic heroes: an Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, or Rogue. Each character has their own strategic role and passive ability, and can be customized with weapons, armor, trinkets, and skills. Character abilities are represented by cards; players personalize their deck of skill cards as they progress through the adventure to create a well-rounded party.

"With the Nintendo Switch 2 on the horizon and presumably launching sometime in the Summer,  perhaps it’s a little too late for even one ofthe best Switch controllersandJoy-Con alternativesto hit the market. But I suppose it’s better late than never. The NYXI Hyperion 2 is a vast improvement over the original Switch's stock Joy-Con with smooth Hall Effect analog sticks, clicky buttons, and ergonomic grips. And since the Hyperion 2 can be used while detached from the Switch, it’s even good enough to recommend in place of a Pro controller (although it does not come with a snap-grip). So, if you’re looking to stay with the original Switch for the foreseeable future and are still looking for a Joy-Con upgrade to improve the handheld experience, this is what you want.

Coming for the first Hyperion, the Hyperion 2 sports a much more sensible design – while it’s a bit wider than the normal Joy-Con, it doesn’t have a weird grip style that juts out horizontally. The Hyperion 2 retains a symmetrical shape and looks like it belongs on a Switch. A major perk is the ergonomic grip that fills my hands akin to a Steam Deck, riding the line between being substantial and not being too bulky. There’s a textured surface on each handle that also helps your grip stay secure. This feels like a proper controller to hold and remains relatively lightweight at just 80g each (normal Joy-Cons weigh in around 50g each).
The buttons might take a moment to get used to since they work quite differently from the standard Joy-Con. Both the directional pad and face buttons have a clicky mouse-like actuation. What you get in return is a softer and more responsive button-press that’s lighter on the thumbs – they’re also bigger to make them even easier to use. My only gripe is that they have a little too much wiggle room since they’re not tightly locked in place and don’t feel as stable as they should be.
That mouse-click design extends to the shoulder bumpers (L and R) and triggers (ZL and ZR). Since the Switch doesn’t have analog triggers, the Hyperion 2 is able to have hair triggers without losing functionality. They sport a very short travel distance and are quick to hit while being light to the touch. The bumpers are easy to hit as well and all it takes is a tap to actuation, and it’s responsive enough to press on the side of the bumper as well.
The biggest improvement, however, is in the analog sticks. Not only does the magnetic Hall Effect design solve the issue of stick drift (which has plagued many Switch owners), these are full-fledged analog sticks that rival that of other consoles. You get a full range of motion and a consistent resistance throughout that range – while it’s just a tad stiff to get off the deadzone, they remain smooth to the touch for precise movements.
Most aftermarket controllers nowadays have back buttons, including the Hyperion 2 – you get two programmable buttons (one on each grip) that sits along your middle finger. NYXI struck a good balance between being easy enough to press without too much effort and not being so light that you'd accidentally hit them (unless you’re gripping your Switch like your life depends on it.) However, a knock against them here is that you need to download a mobile app called KeyLinker to program opposite-side inputs to a back button. It’s a woefully unintuitive app that also requires you to unlink the controls from the Switch in order to connect to the app. Every aftermarket controller I’ve used in the past has the ability to program its extra buttons on the fly, and perhaps this particular aspect is a limitation of the Joy-Con design being split, but it’s baffling that NYXI doesn’t make this easier.
The RGB lighting along the ends of the face buttons and d-pad, and around each analog stick, is a nice aesthetic touch. A tiny lighting button on the back of the grips lets you cycle through four different settings: off, rainbow effect, solid color, and breathing solid color. For both solid color settings, you can choose seven different colors by holding the lighting button and using the analog stick to cycle through them. Both grips can have their RGB set independently so you can have your own color combo.
You still get rumble functionality (although not HD rumble) and gyroscope motion controls when using the Hyperion 2 wirelessly. The last standout feature, however, is the Turbo setting. There are rare cases in which it’ll be beneficial, but thankfully it’s very easy to set for the moments it’s useful. Simply hold the Turbo button, press the button you want to set, and let go – doing this once will set the button to repeat while holding it, doing it a second time will make the button repeat without touching it, and a third time will reset the button to normal.
When it comes to evaluating gaming performance, I put about five hours into using the NYXI Hyperion 2. The first game I played was Metroid Prime Remastered, and with it being a first-person adventure/shooter, the Hyperion 2 really shined. Looking around and aiming at targets to lock on was so much easier thanks to the smooth analog sticks, so while you don’t necessarily need super-precise aiming in this game, the more robust sticks made it more enjoyable. Jumping is already set to one of the bumpers, but that also freed up both back buttons to be used for inputs like weapon switching or going into Morph Ball mode, which was convenient for me. Here, the Turbo function came in clutch – I set it to ZR so I could rapid-fire by holding ZR instead of having it do a charge shot, and I set the MR back button to shoot normally so I could still do charged shots when I needed.
Doing some cleanup in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was a ton of fun since I love exploring Hyrule for unfinished business, but again, it’s a great game for showcasing the Hyperion 2’s capabilities. I still prefer gyro aiming for making those minute adjustments, but the sticks are so precise that sometimes you don’t need motion controls, especially since the sticks recognize small movements off the deadzone. And having a back button for the sprint action is a godsend for me as well since I can keep controlling the camera at the same time.
I tend to avoid first-person shooters on Switch primarily for performance reasons, but also because playing handheld with the standard Joy-Con is straight-up bad. Like other great Joy-Con alternatives, the Hyperion 2 remedies the problem with its fantastic analog sticks that are on par with that of the Xbox Series X|S gamepad to make aiming much better – I’d even go as far to say that the nimble micro-switch triggers make firing and aiming-down-sights quicker and lighting on my fingers.
NYXI rates the Hyperion 2 to have a 10-meter wireless connection distance, which is a little over 30 feet, and that’s accurate. I never had any issues with connectivity when using it detached from the Switch. But since the Hyperion 2 does not come with a center grip to hold the two parts together, I can’t fully recommend it as a Pro controller replacement until one becomes available – that’s a bummer because every other aspect of it works as a full gamepad alternative as well.
Check out our roundup of thebest Switch accessories!
While battery life is good, it’s not quite as long as the normal Joy-Con (on account of its more sophisticated features). The Hyperion 2 lasts around 10 hours without RGB lighting and about five hours with RGB lighting on. That’s plenty of juice to use wirelessly, but these are meant to be used in the Switch’s handheld form so that wasn’t a major factor for me. Charging is done by being attached to the Switch itself, and the design doesn’t interfere with the console being docked. However, the Hyperion 2 does consume a bit more battery from your system. It wasn’t a noticeable difference, although it’s worth noting – I’m not exactly a stickler for squeezing every minute of battery life from my Switch, so it didn’t concern me all that much.
The NYXI Hyperion 2 is available for $79.99 (the same price as the regular Joy-Con) directly fromthe NYXI website.
I wish the NYXI Hyperion 2 came around much sooner, because it’s the best aftermarket Joy-Con set I’ve used throughout the Nintendo Switch’s lifecycle. Its clicky mouse-like buttons are responsive and easy on the fingers, the grips fill up my hands comfortably without being hefty, and the Hall Effect analog sticks blow the Joy-Con sticks out of the water. The back buttons are super convenient, and the simple Turbo function came in handy in some rare instances. If it came with an attachable grip for better use as a gamepad alternative and had an easier way to map the back buttons, this would be an even better package. First-party Nintendo accessories tend to come at a premium, so relative to the competition and its high quality, the NYXI Hyperion 2 is reasonably priced at $79.99 (which is the same as a new pair of regular Joy-Con). Is it too late to pick up given that the Switch 2’s Joy-Con sport an entirely new design? Maybe. But if you’re still in the market for a new Switch controller, the Hyperion 2 is a smart choice.",1600,"The NYXI Hyperion 2 is a vast improvement over the original Switch's stock Joy-Con.

"TheNintendo Switch 2has finally been revealed, and while it brings huge improvements over the original console, it doesn’t exist in the same vacuum that the original handheld did. With the introduction of devices like theSteam DeckandAsus ROG Ally X, a ton of handheld gaming systems out there can play AAA PC games on the go.

So, while the Switch 2 will automatically have a niche carved out for being a system that plays, well, Nintendo games likeMario Kart World,anyone that’s buying a Switch 2 to play multiplatform games will have to reckon with devices like the Steam Deck – especially with the Switch 2’s $449 price tag.
Now that Nintendo has given a sneak peek into the hardware that’s running its new console, we can take a look at how exactly it will run, and whether or not its 4K promises are more than empty words.
The SoC (System on a Chip) that runs the Nintendo Switch 2 is probably the most important part of the console, but it’s the thing we know the least about. We do know that it’s a “custom Nvidia processor” thatsupports DLSS and ray tracing, but beyond that, neither Nintendo nor Nvidia have revealed any specifics. Luckily, there are a ton of leaks that suggest the Nintendo Switch 2 is using the aging Ampere graphics architecture behind theRTX 3080.
Going all the way back to 2023, there wereleaks suggesting that the Nintendo Switch 2 would be using the Nvidia Tegra T239 SoC. This APU uses 8 ARM A78C cores, combined with an Nvidia Ampere GPU with 1,536 CUDA cores. Napkin math puts that at 12 Streaming Multiprocessors, which would be significantly smaller than even the smallest Ampere GPU – the RTX 3050 for laptops. However, assuming Nvidia didn’t nerf the Ampere SMs in the T239, each SM would have four Tensor Cores and an RT core, making for a total of 48 and 12, respectively.
To be fair, the Steam Deck is using a custom AMD APU that’s built on 8 AMD RDNA 2 GPU cores, which is smaller than what Nintendo is offering here. But, you have to keep in mind that the Steam Deck has a lower resolution display, and pumps more power into it. Plus,AMD Z2 processorsare coming out over the next year, with the Z2 Extreme featuring 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, which will be a huge upgrade. Though, systems with that chipset are going to bemuchmore expensive than the Switch 2.
That small of a GPU basically makes 4K gaming an impossibility natively, but because the Tensor Cores are there, DLSS is going to be a major factor in how the Nintendo Switch performs when docked – assuming this is the SoC that’s actually in the system. However, with so few Tensor Cores, even upscaling to 4K is going to be a stretch in everything but the most lightweight games.
Instead, most games are likely going to target 1080p, even if they don’t natively render at that resolution. There are games like Donkey Kong Bananza that do seem to be rendering at a native 1080p resolution, according toDigital Foundry’s hands-on demos. However, third-party games like Cyberpunk 2077 seem to be relying heavily on upscaling, with native resolutions as low as 540p. I wouldn’t expect the Nintendo Switch 2 to ever be able to handle Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K, even with DLSS, though Nintendo will definitely have better luck with any game it can get running natively at 1080p.
The Ampere cores in the rumored T239 also have RT cores, which should theoretically allow for ray tracing in Nintendo Switch 2 games. Though, again, this will be heavily constrained by the processor’s 12 RT cores. Ray tracing will be possible, but don’t expect any jaw-dropping implementations of the technology, and especially don’t expect it in games likeCyberpunk 2077.
Even with RT cores, ray tracing is an extremely expensive workload for the GPU, and the T239 is limited by more than just its small SM count – power is a huge limiting factor, too. I spoke withRichard Leadbetter over at Digital Foundry, who told me that the entire system likely consumes as little as 10W, including the display, the SoC, and the mainboard. We won’t know exactly what the T239’s actual TDP (thermal design power) is until someone finds a way to measure it, but it likely leaves only 5-6W for the SoC itself – a third of the power of the Steam Deck’s AMD APU.
However, while the Nintendo Switch 2 might not be able to produce the same amount of power as ahandheld gaming PClike the Asus ROG Ally X, that doesn’t mean there won’t be gorgeous games running on the system. After all, games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza look stunning, and it goes to show how clever Nintendo developers are at getting the most out of the hardware in the Switch.
After all, the original Nintendo Switch was powered by the Nvidia Tegra X1, which was built on thenow-ancient Maxwell graphics architectureand only packed 256 CUDA cores. Ampere is orders of magnitude more efficient than Maxwell even on its best days, and there are six times more cores in the Switch 2’s GPU. The Nintendo Switch 2 should bewayfaster than the original console, which bodes well for cross-generation ports like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
While a total system power budget of 10W means the system isn’t quite as fast as it could be, it does mean the battery will have a much better time keeping up. Nintendo has come out and said it should last around 2 hours at a minimum. That’s less than was quoted for the original Switch, but that shouldn’t be too surprising, due to its higher-resolution display and more powerful processor.
The Nintendo Switch 2 has a 5,220mAh battery, a large step up from the 4,310mAh battery in the original console. That’s a sizable jump, and if its battery has the same voltage of the original Switch, that would equate to around 19Whr. That’s a smaller battery than theSteam Deck, which is probably why Nintendo quotes a similar battery life to the Steam Deck, despite its less power-hungry processor.
Nintendo probably could have put a more powerful battery in the Switch 2, but its decision likely came down to size constraints. There’s only so much battery that’ll fit while retaining the same thickness as the original Nintendo Switch, after all.
The most striking difference at first glancebetween the Switch and Switch 2is probably going to be the display. While it doesn’t have the OLED screen that made theSwitch OLEDsuch a marvel, the display is bigger and has a higher resolution. The Nintendo Switch 2 sports a 7.9-inch LCD display with a resolution of 1920x1080 with HDR 10 support. The display is also fast, supporting variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. That’s honestly a bit overkill considering the silicon powering the thing, but it does mean that older games or indie titles will feel extremely smooth – assuming they have unlocked frame rates. 120Hz is also a useful refresh rate for games that target 40fps since that makes for a clean ratio that won’t result in excessive stuttering.
Nintendo hasn’t released any information about the brightness of the display, but the HDR 10 certification means it needs toat leasthave a peak brightness of 1,000 nits, so it’s going to be a bright screen. We don’t know exactly how color performance will turn out either, but Nintendo does claim that it supports WCG, or Wide Color Gamut.
The display is probably going to be the thing that lifts the Nintendo Switch 2 above its competitors. The Steam Deck LCD has an 800p display with a peak brightness of 400 nits, and it doesn’t support WCG. The Steam Deck OLED does offer a much nicer display, but it’s still an 800p display. The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is also a huge upgrade over the original, which had a 6.2-inch, 720p LCD display.
In a vacuum, the Nintendo Switch 2 is massively better than the original Nintendo Switch. It’s leagues faster, has a screen that’s bigger, brighter and sharper, and has Joy-Con that you don’t have to wrestle with to disconnect. The only problem is that the Switch doesn’t exist in a vacuum anymore.
There are a ton of handheld gaming systems out there now, and while most of them are more expensive than the $449 Nintendo Switch 2, they likely offer a better gameplay experience in multi-platform games. The real appeal of the Switch 2 is going to be Nintendo’s catalog of first-party games, just like with the original console. Nintendo is known for making great games that make the most of its – relatively – weak hardware. If you’re the type of gamer that falls in love with Nintendo games, then the Nintendo Switch 2 makes a lot of sense. However, if you’re just going to get this thing to play Cyberpunk or Elden Ring on the train, there arebetter gaming handheld optionsout there.

"When Pocketpair's monster capturing survival adventurePalworldlaunched, many people compared it to Pokemon, specificallycalling it  ""Pokemon with guns."" It's not Pocketpair's favorite comparison, according to communications director John 'Bucky' Buckley, but the thought of collecting a following of adorable monsters has nonetheless prompted a number of people to ask if Palworld would ever make it to Pokemon's platform of choice, the Nintendo Switch.

Unfortunately, according to Buckley, that's not in the cards, largely due to technical reasons. ""If we could make the game work on the Switch, we would, but Palworld is a beefy game.""
I spoke to Buckley at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco last week following his talk, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During our chat, I also asked Buckley about the possibility of a Nintendo Switch 2 release. He said that Pocketpair is interested, but hasn't gotten a chance to see if a port is even possible yet.
""We haven't seen those specs yet,"" he said. ""Like everyone else, we're waiting. I'm walking around GDC hoping someone will tell me them, but everyone I've spoken to says they haven't even seen them.
""If it's beefy enough, it's 100% worth considering. We did a lot of optimization for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with. Still work to do, but we're really happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible.""
Pocketpairremains entangled in a lawsuit from Nintendo over alleged patent infringement against Pokemon's ball-throwing mechanics, leading some to speculate that to be the actual reason Palworld hadn't made it to Switch.
But the lawsuit isn't really what's stopping the studio from releasing games on Nintendo's platforms,as we saw back in January. Buckleyaddressed the lawsuit very briefly in his GDC talk, saying that it caught the team by surprise, and that the team had done numerous legal checks in the lead-up to release in order to prevent that exact thing. ""Pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge fan [of Pokemon],"" Buckley said in the talk, ""so it was a very depressing day, everyone heads down and walking in the rain.""
The question is, would Nintendo allow a game it's taken such issue with on its next-gen console?
We'll be posting our full interview with Buckley at GDC later this week, so keep checking back for more about Palworld. In the meantime, it's a great time to revisit Palworld if you've stepped away, asthe game just got cross-platformplay in a new update last week.

"Nintendo has announced the Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a special game launching alongside the Switch 2 to take you on a guided tour of its new hardware. Surprisingly, though, it's not a pack-in piece of software, but a separate, paid digital game.

Shown during today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is a ""virtual exhibition"" of the new hardware. Per Nintendo, ""through tech demos, minigames and other interactions, players will get to know the new system inside and out in ways they may never have known about otherwise.""
Today's Direct showed footage of a small player avatar exploring a super-sized Switch 2, reading about the different features and facts about the Nintendo Switch 2. It seems to act like a virtual museum of sorts, but also have some min-games like Speed Golf, Dodge the Spiked Balls, and a Maracas Physics Demo.
On stream and in a press release, Nintendo also confirmed the Switch 2 Welcome Tour will be available to buy from the Nintendo eShop on Switch 2's launch day.
While it's a neat tool,fans were quick to wonder whythis was a paid digital-only game and not a console pack-in for the Nintendo Switch 2. No price has been listed as of this writing.
For comparison, the Switch 2 is also launching with games like Mario Kart World, Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster, and Deltarune Chapters 1 through 4. While a showcase for the new console is certainly intriguing, it will be competing for some stretched wallets early on.
The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025at a $449.99 USD price tag, or $499.99 for the bundle including Mario Kart World.

"Microsoft has created a playable ""interactive space inspired"" byQuake IIusing AI, and it's sparked a vociferous debate online.

As spotted byPC Gamer, thedemois powered by Microsoft'srecently announced Muse and the World and Human Action Model (WHAM) AI system, and ""can dynamically create gameplay visuals and simulate player behavior in real-time,"" which means a semi-playable environment has been generated entirely through AI and without an in-game engine.
""In this real-time tech demo, Copilot dynamically generates gameplay sequences inspired by the classic game Quake II,"" Microsoftexplained. ""Every input you make triggers the next AI-generated moment in the game, almost as if you were playing the original Quake II running on a traditional game engine.

After The Game Awards boss Geoff Keighley shared a brief video of the demo in actionon X / Twitter,hundreds of people responded, with few having anything positive to say.

""And the worst part is gamers will buy it. They buy skins for 100 dollars. They will buy whatever you sell them.""
""Microsoft's boast that they want 'to build a whole catalog of games that use this new AI model,' despite it not being clear if the current technique will ever even be capable of letting you turn around without moving to a random point on the map let alone come up with an original game, really typifies what's wrong with AI and the tech industry,""addedanother.

Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI.The game failed, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”
Still, that hasn’t put off a number of video game companies from using generative AI in the development of their products.Activision recently disclosed the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assetsas part of new requirements on Steam, amid a backlash to an ""AI slop"" zombie Santa loading screen.
And last month,Horizon actor Ashly Burch addressed a controversial AI Aloy video that leaked online, using it to call attention to the demands of striking voice actors.

"As a part of Microsoft's ongoing efforts toimplement artificial intelligence into basically everything, the company is preparing to introduce its AI Copilot into your Xbox experience to give you gaming advice, help you remember where you left off last time you played, and perform other tasks.

Announced today, Copilot for gaming will be rolled out for Xbox Insiders through the Xbox mobile app sometime soon for testing. If you're not already aware, Copilot is Microsoft's existing AI chatbot (that replaced Cortana in 2023) that's already integrated into Windows. The gaming version will have a handful of features at launch. You can ask it to install games on your Xbox for you (a process you can already do now just by pushing a single button on the app), and you can also ask it about your play history (in case you forgot what you were doing last time you played), achievements, library, or for a recommendation of what to play next. You'll also be able to speak to Copilot for Gaming directly on the Xbox app while you're playing, and it will serve you answers in the same way Copilot currently does when asked questions via Windows.
Probably the biggest use-cases touted by Microsoft available at launch is Copilot as a gaming assistant. You can already ask Copilot questions about games any time on PC, such as how to beat a boss or solve a puzzle, and it will source answers via Bing from various online guides, websites, wikis, and forums. Soon, you'll also be able to ask it those same questions on the Xbox app.
""Our goal is to have Copilot for Gaming source the most accurate game knowledge — so we are working with game studios to make sure the information Copilot surfaces reflects their vision, and Copilot will refer players back to the original source of the information.""
Unshockingly, Microsoft does not intend to limit itself to just these Copilot functions. In a press briefing, Microsoft spokespeople discussed other future possibilities for Copilot in video games, including as awalkthrough assistant to explain basic game functions, remember where items where left in a game, or tell you where to find new ones, or as a helper in competitive games that could offer strategy suggestions and tips in real-time to counter opponents' moves, or explain how and why an engagement unfolded the way it did. Though it was emphasized that these were both just ideas they were toying with, the presentation made clear that Microsoft is insistant on finding ways to integrate Copilot closely with regular Xbox gameplay. And Microsoft confirmed to me that it will eventually work with not just first-party studios, but third-party studios for integration into their games as well.
With that in mind, I asked Microsoft if Copilot gaming would be opt in or opt out of use, or if users could opt out of having their data used to train it. The answer is that yes, Xbox Insiders can opt out during the preview, but the door was left open for Copilot to be mandatory in the future. Here's what a spokesperson said:
""During this preview on mobile, players will be able to decide how and when they want to interact with Copilot for Gaming, whether it has access to their conversation history, and what it does on their behalf.
""As we preview and test Copilot for Gaming with players early, we will continue to be transparent about what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices players have around sharing their personal data.""
IGN understands that Copilot is not being limited to just player-focused usage, and that Microsoft will be providing an overview on plans for developer use in asession at the Game Developers Conference on Monday next week.

"No video games for you!Superbadco-writerSeth Rogenhas revealed that Sony foundJonah Hill's character so ""reprehensible"" that reps insisted he stay away from aPlayStationduring a video game scene in the now-beloved comedy.

“On Superbad, we were told that Jonah Hill’s character, Seth, was so reprehensible to the studio that they were like, there’s a scene where they’re playing video games and [Sony] was like, ‘Jonah can’t touch a PlayStation,’ ” Rogen told Rotten Tomatoes in a South By Southwest 2025 red carpet video.
“They were like, ‘We can’t have him interact with our products, because it’s too vile a character.’ And I was like, ‘It’s based on me, that’s very insulting.’ But we accommodated them, ultimately.”
Sony Pictures co-financed the film, so they had a lot of leverage over a few top-notch comics trying to make a generational comedy. Ultimately, instead of Hill’s Seth keysmashing his controller and yelling at the TV screen when he died in-game, Michael Cera’s character Evan can be seen playingThe Getaway: Black Mondayon PS2 in that scene. But fun fact: there’s actually a bit of a gag with one of Cera’s lines here. He mentions using an M16 assault rifle in the game — but The Getaway: Black Monday, a British cop game, doesn’t even include them in the weapons arsenal. Go figure.
Rogen was at SXSW to promote his new Apple TV+ seriesThe Studio, which had its world premiere at the festival just days ago.
Superbad also starred Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Emma Stone, alongside memorable cameos from Bill Hader and Rogen himself. Rogen co-wrote the script with Evan Goldberg and Greg Mottola directed.

All PlayStation 5 consoles also come with Astro's Playroom, the original game/tech demo that kicked off our infatuation with the adorable robot.
Astro Bot Reviewby Simon Cardy
""Astro Bot made me smile from beginning to end. A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive. And while you don’t need a long history with Sony systems to enjoy it, it is especially a delight for those with a piece of PlayStation in their heart as a treasure trove full of playable nostalgia awaits. Taking the PS5 marketing mantra that “play has no limits” more seriously than you’d expect, Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it.""

It retails for $199 new, so that's a substantial 20% in savings.

Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart.

Right now, the recently releasedAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DAM5 desktop processor is back in stock on Amazon and Best Buy at its retail price of $479 shipped. This is the official launch price with zero markup, and it's not bundled with anything you don't want or need.

"Toby Fox has been a busy guy. During today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, the small white dog dev showed the first full trailer for Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4, revealing that chapters 3 and 4 will launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5. It will also be available on all other platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.

Deltarune's first two chapters are mysterious little RPGs following a character named Kris through their adventures in a ""Dark World"" with their classmate Suzie and a prince named Ralsei. They borrow a number of characters and themes from Fox's previous work, Undertale, but thus far it's been unclear if there's any relationship between the two stories. Trailers lately have been referring to it as a ""parallel"" story to Undertale.
In today's trailer, we got our first-ever look at Chapters 3 and 4, though the look was cryptic as is Fox's wont. There was a brief look at the Castle Town with all the characters we've met so far hanging out together (including Queen!), a new battle that looked like some sort of rock show with Guitar Hero-like controls, Suzie throwing Kris into what looks like a chapel with both characters slightly off-color, and a look at two new villains. One, for Chapter 3, appears to be a creepy smile in a static-y TV (recalling the tease at the end of Chapter 2), and the other, a bit less comprehensibly, seems to be a pile of...weird jellyfish? That Suzie and Kris are running from? No idea.
Deltarune has thus far been released chapter by chapter, with chapter 1 coming out on Halloween 2018, and Chapter 2 debuting in September of 2021. Both of the first chapters were free. The total number of chapters is still unknown, but the menu screen has previously seemed to hold room for seven total, meainng that two more may be on the way. The anticipation for these latest chapters has only grown in the last year, withFox confirming last Halloween that 3 and 4would ""100% come out in 2025"". The Nintendo Switch 2 version will include all four chapters, including the two previously released.
Though we haven't yet reviewed the beginnings of Deltarune, we gave Fox's previous game, Undertale, arare 10/10, calling it a ""masterfully crafted experience.""

"Lenovo is offering the best deal right now on PlayStation 5 DualSense controllers. The Deep Earth Collection, which includes the metallicVolcanic Red,Cobalt Blue, andSterling Silver. colorways are on sale for $54 after you apply coupon code:PLAY5in your shopping cart. That's about 33% off and better thanAmazon's Spring Sale.

Lenovo might not be the first store you'd think of for great deals on PlayStation controllers, but surprisingly, no one can match their pricing. This might be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, at least untilSony's PlayStation Days of Play Salethat will probably happen sometime in late May.
The original PS5 DualSense controller is decked out in the same white color scheme as the console itself and retails for $69.99. Since then,Sony has consistently released more and more colors, some of them more striking than others. In late 2023, Sony launched theDeep Earth collection, ""a new metallic colorway for PS5 accessories"" with aptly sounding names like Sterling Silver, Volcanic Red, and Cobalt Blue. These controllers retailed for $79.99 and were (and still are) one of the more striking color schemes. We rarely see these on sale compared to the other colors.
Color aside, the Dualsense is oft regarded as thebest PS5 controller under $100. It also makes for an excellent controller for your PC. The DualSense is modeled after the tried and true design and layout of previous PlayStation controllers, but it also packs in modern features such as haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone and speaker, integrated touchpad, internal gyroscope and accelerometer for motion sensing, and USB Type-C charging.

"One of the best 55"" OLED TVs is on sale for a limited time. Walmart is offering a55"" Samsung S90C 4K OLED Smart TVfor just $989 with free shipping. Beach Camera is the marketplace vendor and it is an authorized Samsung reseller, which means you get the full manufacturer's warranty. The S90C is a 2023 model, but it's a better TV than the2024 S85Dand nearly identical in image quality to the2024 S90D, which is currently selling for $200 more. Ideally you'll pair it with yourPlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or even theupcoming Switch 2 console.

Update:This TV is also available onAmazonfor a little more.
The Samsung S90C is a slightly older 2023 model (superseded by theS90Dfor 2024), but it's still considered to be one of the best OLED TVs available. That's because the S90C uses Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. It's generally considered better than LG's ""Evo"" technology found on the C-series TVs, which attempt to do the same thing. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. At the moment, there's no better panel technology that's readily available at a reasonable price.
OLED technology aside, the Samsung S90C also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz (rare in a 2023 TV) as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. The S90C also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode.

"A video purportedly taken from the next iteration of The Sims has popped up online, and fans have expressed their concern about what it may mean for the much-loved series.

Project Rene- the codename sometimes used interchangeably with The Sims 5, although EA maintains Project Rene is, in fact, a spin-off project - has been bubbling around for a few years now, but early access footage from a game entitled ""City Life Game With Friends"" has many players thinking that this could well be the next Sims game.
The video itselfis a full 20 minutes long and shows the player clicking through text prompts to select their outfit, hair, watch, activities, and so on. He then spawns into a sunlit Plaza de Poupon where he buys some food and mingles with the locals. He later goes to work in the outdoor café.
Characters are clearly called Sims throughout the playtest, talk in Simlish, and are adorned with The Sims' tell-tale Plumbob.
""I am terribly disappointed with Project Rene. Yes, I know, according to EA, 'this is not the final game.' Is this a joke or what?""said one unhappy playeron The Sims' subreddit on a post entitled ""I think Project Rene is a redflag (I hope not)"" that has been upvoted hundreds of times.
""EA clearly wants to kill off normal Sims games and push people toward the mobile-style experience. So in their mind, a reboot literally means this — at least that’s what I THINK.""
""This is not going to be for me, I can tell already,"" saidanother. ""It just seems so basic and I don't want to play The Sims on my phone.""
""The funny thing is, making a PC/mobile cross-compatible Sims game isn't a bad idea,""positeda fan. ""EA just believes that mobile games HAVE to be ugly for some reason. They're chasing all of the design trends of the past decade, but it means that this thing already looks dated and it's not even out yet.""
""The way The Sims was a literally [sic] satire about capitalist suburban consumption-as-happiness.... And this is where the Sims ended up. Endless consumption-as-happiness,""suggestedanother.
Project Rene — the codenamed game initially thought to be The Sims 5 until EA distanced itself from those rumors —was first teased in 2022during a Behind the Sims Summit. It's afree-to-playSims game that featuresmultiplayer inspired by Animal Crossing and Among Us. It hasn't yet been formally revealed or received a release date, but EA has been holding small,invite-only playtests for the gamesince its announcement, with the game's latest playtest presumably spawning these recent leaks.
The name Rene was chosen because it references words like ""renewal, renaissance, and rebirth"" that ""represent the developer's renewed commitment for the Sims' bright future.""
Last October, however,images of Project Rene leakedfrom a closed online test, prompting complaints about the art style, limited features, and the use of microtransactions. It was the addition of a café that drew the most skepticism, primarily due to the smiliaries to 2018's The Sims Mobile. It was then that EA said Project Rene was not The Sims 5 but would, in fact, be a different ""cosy, social game"" released under The Sims franchise.
Don't forget that The Burglar, a familiar sight for those of us who've spent time with any of the older Sims gamessnuck back into our livesas part of the latest update forThe Sims 4.

"One of the biggest reasons for why we remember the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games so fondly is because of the licensed soundtrack. From punk rock to hip-hop, and a new wave of hardcore with the remasters, the series forged our music tastes, and it will continue to do so withTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remastered coming July 11this year. In the lead up to its release, Activision is putting togetherthe official THPS 3 + 4 playlist on Spotifyand continually updating it as it reveals more and more of the song list.

[Editor's note: Activision revealed additional new and returning songs for the game on March 27, 2025, and this article has been updated to include them.]
The first and second waves of tracks have been revealed, and here are the songs we currently know of for the THPS 3 + 4 Remastered soundtrack:
Additionally, those who get the deluxe edition of the game, or access it through Xbox Game Pass, will also get a full band version of the Doom E1M1 theme song ""At Doom's Gate"" as a playable track (along with the Doom Slayer and Revenant skater skins).
Personally, I'd love to hear Guttermouth's ""I'm Destroying the World"" and AFI's ""The Boy Who Destroyed the World"" from THPS 3 make comebacks, as well as Bad Religion's ""Big Bang"" and Flogging Molly's ""Drunken Lullabies"" from THPS 4. That's mostly because I'm a washed up old punk kid. However, it's an opportunity to discover new music and celebrate the scene as it is today, bridging the gap between the new and oldas was the case with THPS 1 + 2 Remasteredfrom 2021.
Those whopreorder THPS 3 + 4 Remastered's deluxe or collector's editioncan access the playable demo sometime in June which will include two parks, two skaters, and a limited soundtrack. An exclusive physical Birdhouse skate deck also comes with the collector's edition. You'll also be able to access the full game early on July 8, three days ahead of its official release date.",336,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released on July 11.

"Robert Kirkman’s ultra-violent superhero comic book series published by Image Comics is as popular as ever. You have Amazon Prime’s adult animation adaptation of the series, which has justwrapped up its third season, with afourth on the way. Then there’s Mortal Kombat 1,where Omni-Man is playableand fits in perfectly with the violent and gruesome universe we’ve come to know and love.

But if you’re looking for the right place to immerse yourself in the source material, we've got you covered. Reading comics online has never been easier, and we’re here to show you the best ways to do so with Invincible.
If you’re on the fence on starting Invincible (why would you be? It’s amazing), then you can go directly to the Image Comics website to read the first issue absolutely free, no strings attached. This is a great way to see if the story is something that you may be interested in reading long term.
Once you’re ready to start reading the full series on the go, you can sign up for a handful of different digital comics services. You can read all of the Invincible compendiums (larger single-issue collections covering certain arcs) onHoopla. This is a greatfree service for borrowing digital comicsand books, just like the library. The catch - when you make your account, Hoopla looks for libraries in your area and, if that library doesn’t have Invincible available, you aren’t able to “check out” with it. Luckily, this is one of the most popular comic series around, so we’d be shocked if this happened. Link your library card and there you have it, the entirety of Invincible at the press of a button.
The upside to buying Invincible on the Kindle app versus checking it out of a virtual library is that you don’t have to worry about having limited time with it. The Invincible compendiums are hundreds of pages each, and while it’s inherently faster to read comics compared to a traditional book, that time really adds up. So purchasing is a better option for longevity’s sake. Additionally, the digital versions will typically save you a few bucks compared to physical.
If you’re like me and you prefer that tactile feel of flipping through the pages and displaying a nice shiny spine on your shelf, all three Invincible compendiums are also all available in trade paperback and hardcover versions. The trade paperbacks are each tend to go on sale off and on at Amazon right now, so now’s the perfect time to bolster your bookshelf collection. There are also the supplemental stories Invincible Universe you can expand to, which reveal the histories of many of Invincible’s most popular characters.

"Indiana Jones and the Great Circlehas a PlayStation 5 rating onthe website of the Entertainment Software Rating Board, suggesting a release date isn’t too far away.

MachineGames’ well-received action adventure game launched on Xbox Series X and S and PC in December 2024, and currently has a spring 2025 release window on PS5. That suggests the game will be out at some point in the next few months.
Microsoft has so far remained quiet on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s PS5 release date, preferring to focus on other games at its recent Xbox Developer Direct showcase. But it seems an announcement will be made soon.
MachineGames has issued a series of updates since the game’s initial Xbox launch,most recently fixing various bugs and adding support for Nvidia DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Ray Reconstruction on PC. The PS5 version will of course feature all the console updates released to date.
Boosted by launching day one on Game Pass, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has so farreached 4 million players— a figure that will no doubt see a significant boost one the PS5 version goes live.
Indiana Jones actor Harrison Ford has saidTroy Baker playing the beloved character in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is proof ""you don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul.""
Ford discussed alleviating control of Indy withThe Wall Street Journal, saying he was very happy with the performance of The Last of Us actor Baker.
""You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul,"" Ford said. ""You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent. He did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.""

"Video game companies across Japan have suffered a dramatic stock market plunge sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

White House officials signalled what they describe as specific reciprocal tariffs on roughly 60 of the ""worst offenders"" to go into effect on 9 April. Japan is one of the countries subject to these customised tariff rates, at 24%.
Trump's officials say these countries charge higher tariffs on U.S. goods, impose ""non-tariff"" barriers to U.S. trade, or have otherwise acted in ways they feel undermine American economic goals.
Tariffs are essentially taxes placed on the cost of importing certain goods. While it's possible for companies in the supply chain to simply eat these costs, more often than not these taxes are passed onto consumers. And unfortunately for gamers, rising prices are very likely to impact tech and gaming goods.
Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark index closed down 7.8%, the ASX 200 in Australia lost 4.2%, and the Kospi in South Korea ended 5.6% lower. The Shanghai Composite closed 7.3% lower and Taiwan Weighted Index lost 9.7%. The Hang Seng was down by 12.5% in afternoon trading.
Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, rounded up the decline in video game stocks based in Japan as the market opening in the morning of April 7. Nintendo was down 7.35%, Sony 10.16%, Capcom 7.13%, and Sega 6.57%.
It's Monday 10am in Japan where Japanese game stocks currently react to these insultingly dumb tariffs like so:Nintendo -7.35%Sony -10.16%Bandai Namco -7.03%Konami -3.93%Sega -6.57%Koei Tecmo -5.83%Capcom -7.13%Square Enix -5.23%The mobile game companies do even worse.
Last week Nintendo shocked the video game world by announcinga delay to pre-orders of the Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S., blaming tariffs and the uncertainty they have caused across the world. The pre-orders were set to go live on April 9, but in the U.S. specifically they were postponed, with the June 5 release date said to be on-track. Pre-orders go live elsewhere on April 9 as planned.
Nintendo announced the Switch 2 at $449.99, with a Mario Kart World bundle priced $499.99.Mario Kart World itself is priced $79.99.
Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad had warnedthat Trump's surprise tariffs on countries such as Vietnam, where Nintendo had shifted some of its Switch 2 manufacturing in anticipation of U.S. tariffs on China, might have caused a rethink.
""While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset U.S. tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world,"" Ahmad said. ""The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect.""
Nintendo fansandanalystsare now concerned Nintendo will raise the price of the Switch 2 and its games even further, even asit suffers a backlash to its pricing following the console’s reveal.
There are question marks over Sony, too, which manufactures PlayStation consoles, including the $700 PlayStation 5 Pro. IGN has asked the company if it has any comment on the prospect of increased prices in the U.S.
Goldman Sachs now forecasts there is a 45% chance the U.S. will fall into recession in the next 12 months, up from a previous estimate of 35%. JPMorgan now sees a 60% chance of a U.S. and global economic downturn.
According to a report by theBBC, Trump has defended the tariffs, saying ""sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.""

"Sony is working on a new Starship Troopers movie reboot, according to various Hollywood sources.

The Hollywood Reportersaid District 9, Elysium, and Chappie director Neill Blomkamp has signed on to write and direct a new adaptation of Starship Troopers, the 1959 military sci-fi novel by Robert A. Heinlein.DeadlineandVarietybacked up the report.
This new Starship Troopers movie is not a continuation of or related to Paul Verhoeven’s cult classic 1997 sci-fi satireStarship Troopers. Rather it is a new adaptation of Heinlein’s novel, and comes from Sony’s Columbia Pictures.
News of Blomkamp’s involvement with this new Starship Troopers movie feels puzzling givenSony itself recently announced a live-action movie of blockbuster PlayStation Studios shooter Helldivers. Arrowhead's Helldivers is heavily inspired by Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers, and sees cannon fodder soldiers tasked with defending a satirized fascist Super Earth regime from alien bugs, among other enemy factions, while preaching Liberty and Managed Democracy to the masses.
Sony now faces the prospect of having new Starship Troopers and Helldivers movies going up against each other, although The Hollywood Reporter said Blomkamp’s take is not a remake of the Verhoeven movie, rather a return to the source material. Heinlein’s book that Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers is based on differs strongly in tone from the film, with many believing it promotes the ideals the film satirizes.
Neither this new Starship Troopers nor the Helldivers movie has a release window, so it may be some time before we see or hear from either project. Blomkamp’s last film was Sony’s own Gran Turismo, an adaptation of the long-running PlayStation-exclusive driving simulation series.

"No two rooms at Mt. Holly are the same — nor do they even stay in the same place
byJay Castello
The house at Mt. Holly has 45 rooms. But the placement of each of those rooms is up to you — and it resets every day. You’ve been left the house and its estate as an inheritance, but only if you can find the mysterious 46throom.
In this way,Blue Princeblends its puzzles with both deck-building and roguelite elements. When you open the entrance hall door at the start of every morning, you’ll be given a choice of three rooms that might lie beyond it. Each of them has a fixed number and orientation of doors, limiting your path through the house, and each room has its own small bonus — or, in some cases, a drawback.
You might, for instance, draw the bedroom, and get rewarded with 10 additional steps to use throughout the day. Or you might draw the weight room, and lose half of your carefully scrounged footsteps. (The game’s step counter is a limitation on your movement; you can’t walk forever through the house, and if you run out of steps, you’ll have to come back the next day and start from scratch.) Or you might draw the parlor and have to solve a truth-and-lie logic puzzle to get gems, which you can spend on drafting more useful rooms later. Or you might find the nook, which always has a key; keys become increasingly necessary as you progress, since doors become more likely to be locked.
And then, packed in everywhere and anywhere, there’s the intrigue. In one early run, I opened a chest to find the “Key to the Secret Garden,” which warned me that it would not be an easy room to locate. It wasn’t until much later that I got access to the orchard, which explained how and where I could get access to said garden. But then I had to wait to run into the key again. That wait could have been a drag, except that (at least in the game’s first 10 or so hours) I was juggling dozens of these small cause-and-effect bits of progress at once, so there was always something to make me feel like I was moving forward.
This gradual accumulation of knowledge is almost the whole ofBlue Prince(one early room recommends having a notebook at hand; I filled several pages), although there are some architectural elements of the house that become permanent, making future runs more likely to be fruitful. These moments tend to feel big, some of them even having very atmospheric cutscenes that break up the routine of drafting door after door. You’ll also be collecting passwords and codes that stay the same across runs. Mainly, every new draft is a question of what you will learn about the estate and how you will apply that knowledge in future runs.
Spending run after run in the house gives you a lot of time to appreciate just how finely it’s built. Every room has a different walking sound to reflect the kind of flooring it has, for example. There are moments when the creeping dread of being alone in a shape-shifting house suddenly cuts through, momentarily but completely changing the atmosphere. And there are dozens of architectural details and notes and bits of clutter that all go into building up an idea of the history that once went on between these old walls.
With so many details hidden in every room, though, it’s important to bear in mind that the house also holds many, many mysteries that go much beyond your inheritance. After a while, discoveries that didn’t lead to something useful for the specific goal of finding the 46th room sometimes started to feel like disappointments, until I rolled around to the other side and started to appreciate just how much more is going on in this mysterious mansion. Being open to these grander puzzles, and accepting that solving one big question is only a sliver of what the game has to offer, made it much less frustrating.
Having said that, that willingness to be open is sometimes difficult to maintain when you run into a string of bad luck. Unless you are enlightenment-levels of willing to accept everything the game has to throw at you, sometimes you really will want to do a few runs just looking for something specific, which is never guaranteed. And unfortunately, the first several minutes of every attempt do end up feeling very samey, as the game doesn’t usually start offering more interesting rooms until you’re some way into the house. Some rooms are also just straight-up annoying. There’s a math-based puzzle that I hated every time, and it becomes harder and harder as you do more and more runs — but it’s very punishing to skip it because it grants keys, which are extremely valuable.
Because of friction like this, I think thatBlue Princeis going to live on the strength of its community. There came a point where repeating runs was not getting me anywhere, and every time, I would dread having to spend 10 or so minutes going through the motions again before getting a chance of seeing something new. (Or at least, something new that was going to make me feel like I was actually progressing toward a goal that I was interested in.) It turned out that I had missed something I could interact with in a room that I had previously written off as useless, which I only found out by talking to other people who were playing. Figuring that out had me rolling credits within a couple of hours — and more importantly, those couple of hours completely recaptured the enthusiasm and sense of discovery I’d had in the early game.
Seeding those kinds of hints without spoilers isn’t easy, but I do expectBlue Princeto grow the kind of fan base that can pull it off. It’s good now, but that will make it even better.

"It's Mario's big day, and Nintendo's plumber is getting a new Lego set with quite a few pieces in the box. Lego has revealed a new Mario Kart Lego set today, March 10, with almost 2,000 pieces and an ""18+"" age recommendation, arriving on May 15, 2025. It's available topreorder now at the LEGO Store.

Originally spottedpopping up on some store listings, Lego has officially unveiled the set, which includes both Mario and his Standard Kart from the Mario Kart series. It's a detailed model, meant for display and decor, with a special stand meant to showcase Mario and his kart at various angles.
OnLego's site, the company clocks the Mario Kart build at 1,972 pieces with a recommended ""18+"" Ages rating. This is due to the complexity of the build, it seems, and the intention of the product versus sets meant for play. ""This building kit is part of a large assortment of LEGO Sets for Adults designed for people who enjoy hands-on creative activities to relax,"" Lego said in its description.
Here we go! 🏆 Launching May 15th 🏁#LEGOSuperMario#MarioKartpic.twitter.com/NZ13sCIFHo
The tenor of this build certainly seems aimed at the older, ""advanced"" builder of Lego. It also works with the Lego Builder app, which offers in-app building instructions and tools that let builders zoom and rotate around a 3D image of the model as they build. The final result is a posable, Lego-made Mario in his Kart.
Lego and Mario have built up a solid relationship over the years, with the collaboration resulting in numerous crossover sets. There's the Lego Super Mario line, which erred more on the side of interactive play andincorporated some game elements into its set design.
Still, some other options were aimed more at the older crowd who might like to build for relaxation and display over interactivity, likethe Pirahna Plantandthe Lego Super Mario World set featuring Mario and Yoshi. Some offer activities for the kids, while others offer nostalgia and complex builds for the adults.
The Lego Mario Kart build is up for pre-order now, at a price point of $169.99 / £139.99 / €169.99. The set will fully launch on May 15, 2025.

Taking toX/Twitter, Square Enix said Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster's success had pushed sales for the entire Final Fantasy series — that'sallFinal Fantasy games, not just the pixellated ones — up to a staggering 200 million copies.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomfans will be able to see the era-defining Nintendo titles in a new light on Nintendo Switch 2 with a duo of enhanced visual upgrades, Nintendo announced Wednesday during itsNintendo Direct presentation about the new console. If you already own the games, you won’t automatically have the Switch 2 version and will need to purchase an upgrade pack to get it. However, Switch Online subscribers who have the Expansion Pack tier and own copies of these games will get the upgrades for no additional cost, according toNintendo.
The Switch 2 version of each game will include a “Zelda Notes” feature, which will provide game tips to players; you can use this Switch 2-only feature via the Nintendo Switch app on smart devices. It can help you find Korok seeds, for example. That’s in addition to enhanced resolution and frame rates and HDR support.
Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomhave earned their place among the greatest video games of all time, and delivered on the promise of a truly open-world Zelda game where you could see a mountain in the distance and then go climb it. Both games managed this feat on the Switch, which, as a device designed for both big-screen and handheld play, was significantly underpowered compared to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (and later, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X).
Of course, this experience wasn’t without its compromises; at launch forBreath of the Wild, certain areas of the world exhibitednotable performance problems, especially when played in the Switch’s docked mode. Less than a month later,Nintendo issued a patch that made significant improvementsbut didn’t completely alleviate frame-rate drops below 30 frames per second.
Now, the Switch 2’s beefed-up hardware will be able to renderBreath of the Wild’s version of Hyrule with a much fuller degree of fidelity and fluidity.
Update: Added that Switch Online subscribers with the Expansion Pack tier get both Switch 2 Edition versions ofBreath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomfor no added cost if you own them already.

"The GeForce RTX 4090 is a generation older than the new Blackwell 50 series GPUs, but this doesn't change the fact that it's still one of the most powerful cards out there, eclipsing the GeForceRTX 5080orRTX 4080 Superor the RadeonRX 9070 XTorRX 7900 XTX. Only one GPU performs better - theRTX 5090- and you'll need to use up a lifetime of luck to find one that isn't marked up by hundreds, even thousands of dollars.

Because the RTX 4090 has been discontinued, it's getting harder to source as well. Fortunately, Dell still sells aAlienware Aurora R16gaming PC configuration that can be equipped with a 4090 GPU. Not only is it one of the few RTX 4090 prebuilts still available - Lenovo and HP no longer carry them - it's also one of the more reasonably priced ones.
ThisAlienware Aurora R16 gaming PCis equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F CPU, GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, 16GB of DDR5-5200MHz RAM, and a 1TB NVMe SSD. The processor can also be upgraded up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K. If you're getting system with a focus on gaming, then the upgrade is unnecessary. Gaming at higher resolutions is almost always GPU bound, and besides, the default Intel Core Ultra 7 265F is a solid processor with a max turbo frequency of 5.3GHz and a total of 20 cores. It's cooled by a robust 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler and the entire system is powered by an 1,000W 80PLUS Platinum power supply.
Dell just dropped the price on this upgraded RTX 4090 model to $3,599.99 after a $400 instant discount. It's $600 more than the base model Alienware 4090 gaming PC, but that's because the processor has been upgraded to a much more powerful Intel Core i9-14900KF CPU. You also get quadruple the RAM and double the storage.
The RTX 4090 is themost powerful RTX 40 series GPUon the market. Compared to the new Blackwell cards, only the $2,000 MSRP RTX 5090 is superior in performance. This card will run every game comfortably at 4K resolution; you should be hitting 60+fps even with all settings turned to the max and ray tracing enabled, doubly so if DLSS is supported. The only setting that the 4090 (as well as every other GPU) struggles with is path tracing, but no one really ever turns this on except during benchmark tests or social media flexing. The RTX 5090 might be faster, but for the vast majority of people out there, it's just wasted power since the 4090 already excels at pretty much all things gaming.
Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU Reviewby Chris Coke
""The RTX 4090 may be huge and expensive, but holy smokes if it doesn’t blow the competition out of the water. That’s a little unfair because it’s currently the only card of this new generation that’s available, so we only have cards from the past few years to compare it to. But until the rest of the pack can catch up, between its impressive hardware specs and its DLSS 3 AI wizardry, even the $1,599 price doesn’t seem unreasonable for the unrivaled frame rates that this card can crank out.""
Dell is offering anAlienware Aurora R16 gaming PCequipped with the new GeForce RTX 5080 GPU for $2,499.99 shipped. The RTX 5080 is one of three new Blackwell graphics cards that are out (and impossible to find). In ourNvidia GeForce RTX 5080 FE review, Jackie writes that ""If you already have a high-end graphics card from the last couple of years, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 doesn’t make a lot of sense – it just doesn’t have much of a performance lead over the RTX 4080, though the extra frames from DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation do make things look better in games that support it. However, for gamers with an older graphics card who want a significant performance boost, the RTX 5080 absolutely provides – doubly so if you’re comfortable with Nvidia’s AI goodies.""

"If you're looking for an affordable power bank that will fast charge your Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or Apple iPhone 16, then check out today's deal. Amazon has theIniu 10,000mAh Power Bankwith up to 45W of Power Delivery over USB Type-C for only $11.25 after you redeem the 50% off coupon on the product page. Iniu power banks have solid reviews and are less expensive than equivalent Anker models.

This Iniu power bank holds a 10,000mAh, or 37Whr battery capacity. If you factor in 80% power efficiency, here are the approximate number of times you can fully recharge each gaming handheld:
The Iniu power bank has three output ports: one built-in 45W USB Type-C cable, one 45W USB Type-C port, and one USB Type-A port. The 45W of Power Delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch (18W) and Steam Deck (40W) at their fastest rate. This power bank is also a solid choice for charging your Apple iPhone 16, sinceChargerLAB has shown that the maximum charging rate caps at about 30W, even for the Pro Max model.
We don't yet know what the maximum charging rate for theNintendo Switch 2will be, but we are hoping that it will be greater than the 18W maximum of the original Switch.We do know that the battery capacity is higher(5,220mAh vs 4,310mAh), so it's only natural to assume that the charging rate will also be higher to maintain the same recharging time. The Nintendo Switch 2's 5,200mAh capacity should translate to about 20Whr, which means this power bank will be able to charge it about 1.5 times.
The built-in cable is a popular feature on newer and generally pricier power banks because you no longer have to bring along your own USB Type-C cable. When you're on the go, the USB plug can be clipped onto the power bank to form a handy little lanyard. The cable itself is quite sturdy with a respectable break strength of 44 pounds and the lanyard loop when clipped to the power bank itself has a break strength of 13 pounds.

"If you, like many of us, thought that Nintendo was finally winding down its ongoing production of tiny plastic figures with real yet negligible functionality in its video games with the release of its next console, think again. The Nintendo Switch 2 isn't just compatible with old amiibo, Nintendo seems to be committed to still making new ones. Today, it announced Tulin, Yunobo, Riju, Sidon, and Mineru's construct figurines from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Kimberley, Luke, and Jamie figures from Street Fighter 6.

The first four figurines launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, and have compatibility with Tears of the Kingdom, unlocking a fabric for Link's paraglider. They'll also provide weapons and materials in-game, just like the existing Tears of the Kingdom Link amiibo and the other past Zelda-series amiibo that are already compatible with the game.An additional amiibo for Mineru's construct will become available at a later date. It's likely that Mineru at least will have some sort of pairing with thenewly-announced Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonmentgame coming this winter, as the game takes place during the era when Mineru was building and using her construct, and we saw some of its gameplay in the trailer today.
We also learned that three Street Fighter 6 characters will get amiibo to go along with the release of Street Fighter 6 on Nintendo Switch 2. Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly will all get amiibo releases on June 5 as well, and a new run of amiibo cards will also launch themed around Street Fighter characters. We know that all of these will unlock ""exclusive in-game content"" such as device wallpapers, photo frames, and character customization capabilities.

It's undeniable that Nintendo had really tapered off its amiibo releases in recent years, so this news is a bit surprising. After an initial run of 18 back in 2014 when the figurines launched, it rapidly produced 71 different figures in 2015, and a steady cadence of 12 to 35 a year from 2016 until 2019. Amiibo releases slowed during the pandemic, and Nintendo began releasing fewer and fewer games with interesting amiibo support features. In 2024, only 7 new amiibo were released, and only two amiibo-compatible games: The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and Monster Hunter Stories. Given the slowdown, it's a bit surprising to see Nintendo recommit, but as long as collectors are still happy, right?

"Nintendo just revealed so much about the Nintendo Switch 2 during its latest Direct, but we have learned even more since the hour-long presentation ended, including the new console's tech specs. While we still have a lot of questions, let's break down what's new with the Switch 2.

This had been touched on before, butNintendo reiteratedthat this new system will feature a 7.9-inch wide color gamut LCD screen that is capable of outputting at 1080p (1920x1080). This is a big upgrade from Switch 1's 6.2-inch screen, the Switch OLED's 7-inch screen (although we will miss OLED!), and the Switch Lite's 5.5-inch screen.
There is also support for HDR10 and VRR up to 120 Hz, which means games can jump up to 120fps if they and your setup allow it.
It was also confirmed that slotting the Switch 2 to its new dock will allow games to be played in 4K (3840x2160) at 60fps or 1080p/1440p (1920x1080/2560x1440) at 120fps. We know these higher-end graphics are made possible by a ""custom processor made by NVIDIA,"" but sadly we are currently given no further details in regard to Switch 2's CPU/GPU.
What was revealed, however, was the battery life. The Switch 2's internal battery is a Lithium-ion battery with 5220mAh, and this will allow for approximately 2 - 6.5 hours of battery life and a charge time of three hours when in Sleep mode. Nintendo noted these are ""rough estimates"" and that the ""battery life will depend on the games you play.""
This battery life is just about the same as the launch model Switch 1 as it boasted a range of 2.5 - 6.5 hours. On the other hand, the Switch 2's battery life is a downgrade from the three newer Switch models - Nintendo Switch (4.5 - 9 hours), Nintendo Switch - OLED Model (4.5 - 9 hours), and Nintendo Switch Lite (3 - 7 hours).
Elsewhere, we learn that the Switch is approximately 4.5 inches tall x 10.7 inches wide x .55 inches thick with the Joy-Con 2 attached. This translates to a weight of roughly .88 pounds without Joy-Con 2 and 1.18 lbs with them attached.
The weight of the Switch 2 is an exact match for the current Switch 1 model, but it is both taller and longer than any current model with Joy-Con attached;
Speaking of Joy-Con, we sadly don't get the confirmation that they are using Hall Effect joysticks that would likely preventthe drifting issues many Switch owners experienced.They very well may use them, asit was hinted at in a patent from 2023,but we'll have to wait to find out for sure.
On the audio front, the Switch 2 supports linear PCM output 5.1ch. If you want a surround sound effect, that can also be enabled via headphones of the built-in speaker after a system update.
For storage, the Switch 2 will feature 256 GB of internal storage, which is another upgrade from the 32 GB available on the Switch and Switch Lite and the 64 GB on the Switch - OLED Model. Another big difference here is that the Switch 2 will require microSD Express cards for up to 2TB of extra storage, meaning the microSDXC cards the current Switch models support will not be able to be transferred over to the new console.
To wrap up, it was also revealed the Switch 2 will support Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi 6), it will have 2 USB-C ports, a 3.5mm 4-contact stereo mini-plug (CTIA standard), and a built-in monaural microphone with noice cancellation, echo cancellation, and auto gain control.

"The Nintendo Switch 2 arrives on June 5, 2025, and it will likely be a hot commodity when it launches. Over on the official Nintendo store, the company is implementing some pre-order measures to ensure bona fide Switch players are getting their pre-orders.

On theMy Nintendo Store, those with a Nintendo Account can register their interest in pre-ordering a Nintendo Switch 2 system and ""select accessories"" from the Nintendo Store. Those who express interest will then get an invitation email once their turn in line comes up, valid for 72 hours. The catch? You'll need to have put in some time on your old Switch, and been a Switch Online member.
""Invitation emails will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis to registrants who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025,"" according to the fine print on the site.
Nintendo also notes that invitations are ""non-transferable"" and will be sent to email addresses associated with the Nintendo Account that registers interest. For the system and each accessory, there will also be a one-per-account limit during the invitation period. Currently on the site, you can express interest in either a base Nintendo Switch 2 system, or the one bundled with Mario Kart World.
Orders will be shipped after purchase, and the approximate shipping date will be provided when ordering. Nintendo also specifies: ""Please note that release-day delivery is not guaranteed due to processing and shipment times.""
While not said outright by Nintendo, all of these measures seem dedicated towards ensuring that someone buying a Switch 2 through this process is someone who wants to purchase and play a Switch 2 for themselves, rather than flip it online.
Scalping has been a frequent problem for new releases of sought-after products. Notably, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S sawscalpers pursuing the new hardware, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game hasbeen dealing with ongoing scalping and shortages.
Valve found some success in its queue system for the Steam Deck, utilizing a method that tied Steam accounts to purchases alongside checks for whether an account was made before, or after, a certain window.It worked, and it's not surprising now to see Nintendo taking similar measures with the My Nintendo Store process.
Of course, there will be other ways to pick up a Switch 2. But hopefully options like this can help some long-time Switch 1 owners avoid the potential chaos of locking down a launch day Switch 2 pre-order.

"Today's Nintendo Direct announcement of anew Virtual Game Cards feature for sharing games between systemsis being met with surprise and interest from fans. But it's also raising some questions, most notably one about the Nintendo Switch 2, thanks to a fine print footnote on an official Nintendo webpage.

The question comes fromthis page, which explains how Virtual Game Cards work. Most of what's here is fairly straightforward (well, as straightforward as anything is). But there's a fascinating footnote at the bottom of the page, tied to the feature of moving games between Switch systems. It reads:
What's throwing people here is the phrasing ""Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games."" The part about ""exclusive games"" is straightforward enough, as we already knew there would be games that are only playable on the Nintendo Switch 2, and not the current Switch. But we also know thatthe Nintendo Switch 2 is backwards compatible with Switch 1(mostly). So what is a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition game?
Some fans are suggestingthis is a subtle confirmationthatthere will be some ""enhanced editions""of existing Switch games that add new features or improved performance, only for Switch 2. If that's the case, it would make sense that purchasing them on Switch 2 would not allow them to be shared with a Switch 1, because they simply wouldn't function correctly and would effectively be a different edition of the version on Switch 1.
That's not the only theory though. Some others are speculating that this doesn't confirm anything, merely suggests an unfortunate situation where users won't be able to use Nintendo's shiny new Virtual Game Card feature to send some or all Nintendo Switch 2 games backward to Switch 1, even if they're the same game. It's also possible this doesn't suggest anything in particular, but merely opens the door in the future for third-parties to release Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of games if they feel like it.
We reached out to Nintendo to try to get a clarification, but were told by a spokesperson they would have an answer for us on April 2,conveniently the day of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. Just hang in there a little bit longer, everyone.

The Nintendo Switch 2 is launching onJune 5. Pre-orders were initially going live on Wednesday,April 9, but those plans have been postponed due toNintendo assessing the “potential impact of tariffs.” A new pre-order date will be shared at a later time.
The original article follows below.
While I wish to exist in a world where you could easily click “buy” and be guaranteed a console come launch day, it’s not so simple in reality. Hundreds of thousands of people, if not more, are going to be showing up simultaneously, putting a strain on both servers and allocated pre-order stock. In other words, you’ll be lucky to score a pre-order reservation.
That said, there are ways you can prepare yourself for whenever the Switch 2 goes up for pre-order in the hopes of boosting your chance of success. You can sign up to be among the first to know when retailers go live with pre-orders — and, if you’re a longtime Nintendo Switch player, you might be eligible to skip the usual online retailer rush.
Starting with Nintendo,the company is accepting sign-upsfor those hoping to reserve a Switch 2, but there are multiple requirements in place, likely to quash the number of consoles resellers can get their hands on. To express interest in pre-ordering a Switch 2 from Nintendo, you must do the following by April 2:
Only if you meet that criteria can you submit the form to express interest in reserving. That said, there’s no guarantee that you’ll be chosen to receive an invite. But if you are chosen, you’ll get an email from Nintendo on or after May 8 to purchase either the $449.99 model, or the $499.99 model that includesMario Kart World. If you receive an invitation, you’ll have 72 hours to follow through with a purchase.
Whether you qualify for Nintendo’s strict pre-order process or not, it’s a good idea to sign up for email notifications at Best Buythrough this page. Doing so will ensure that you get an email with a specific pre-order time for the Switch 2. Additionally, it’ll loop you into a newsletter that’s only about the Switch 2,its games, and related content (you won’t receive other Best Buy newsletters).
GameStop has aproduct page up for the Switch 2, and you’ll want to enter your email address to receive communications about the specific pre-order details.
Additionally, if you plan to pre-order at GameStop, you should know that it’srunning a promotion beginning April 9that lets customers get up to $175 trade-in credit for their Switch consoles when reserving a Switch 2. The amount of trade-in credit you’ll get depends on the model you’re trading in, as well as its condition and whether you have all of the components.

"The new Minecraft movie has looked interesting from the very virst trailer and, now that it's in theaters, is headed straight forbox office success in 2025. With Jack Black and Jason Momoa plopped into the world ofMinecraft, it's a video game movie that has the potential to be popular with a massive audience of both kids and adults. Minecraft is one of thebest-selling video games of all timethat has infiltrated pretty much every medium, so its jump to a feature film was all but a matter of time. In ourreview of A Minecraft Movie, we found it to be surprisingly funny despite its contraints.Audience reactionshave made it a theater-going experience for the ages.

If you're planning to watch A Minecraft Movie in theaters, I've gathered all of the details below. For those of you waiting for it to come out on streaming and digital, I've also gathered the latest info I could find about release dates for both.
A Minecraft Movie, with a wide release date of April 4, is now available in theaters everywhere. To find when and where you can watch the film near you, check the listings featured below for local showtimes.
We don't yet have a streaming release date for A Minecraft Movie, but we know thatit will land on Max when it does hit streamingbecause it'sa Warner Bros. project. There is no clear time period when we can expect the movie to make the jump to a streaming service since it depends on how the film does in the box office, but we can make an educated guess based on past Warner Bros. movies. Theatrical windows have shrunk in the last few years, some as short as 14 days before hitting VOD. For a movie with such crossover appeal like this one, we'd bet that it has a longer life in theaters and won't hit streaming for three to four months. That would place thepotential streaming release date sometime in June or July 2025.
A Minecraft Movie does not currently have a release date for when it will become available to rent or purchase digitally. However, alimited edition steelbook is available for preorder, though without a release date. I'd venture a guess that it will release sometime closer to the end of May 2025.
The marketing team has already pushedMinecraft Movie LEGO setsand aMcDonald's collaboration, and we'll likely see even more merchandise over the coming weeks.
If you haven't been keeping up with the latest trailers for A Minecraft Movie, here's a quick synopsis of the film directly from the Warner Bros. website:
""Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits – Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks) – find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Jack Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative… the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.""
A Minecraft Movie is directed by Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite, Nacho Libre) and stars:
A Minecraft Movie is rated PG for some violence, language, suggestive humor, and occassionally scary images. It has a total runtime of 1 hour and 41 minutes including credits. There is amid-credits and post-credits sceneyou'll want to stick around for as well.",619,"A Minecraft Movie does not yet have a release date for when it will become available to rent or purchase digitally.

"This article contains spoilers for theInvincibleSeason 3 finale.

After eight episodes featuringhugecharacter deaths, multiple Invincibles (Steven Yeun), and so, so much blood and guts, Invincible Season 3 is in the books. Unlike Season 2, which ended with a relatively quieter tag for the finale, Season 3 not only teed up atonof storylines for the already-in-production Season 4… It also included a mid-credits scene that sets up a storyline Invincible co-creator Robert Kirkman never got to do in the comic books.
Before we get to that closing montage – and mid-credits scene – a bit of explanation about the finale itself. It’s for the most part one, long fight scene as Invincible, Oliver (Christian Convery) and Atom Eve (Gillian Jacobs) take on the vicious Viltrumite warrior Conquest (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Conquest is ostensibly on Earth to prepare the world for Viltrumite, er, conquest, but as he explains repeatedly to Invincible, he really loves destroying and torturing things.
After Conquest seemingly kills Eve, Invincible, who has had both hands broken, absolutely loses it and bashes Conquest to “death” with his own head. Some might say this is sweet, sweet vengeance for Negan (also Morgan) famously bashing Glenn Rhee’s (also Yeun) head in on The Walking Dead, but it comes straight from the Invincible comics, which came out in 2009. So incredibly satisfying to watch if you want #Justice4Glenn, but also mostly just a nice coincidence.
In any case, Eve isnotdead and reveals – as fans who watched the Atom Eve Special learned – that when she’s put in moments of extreme stress, she’s able to get past the mental blocks that otherwise stop her from transmuting living matter, instead of just inert materials. However, eagle-eyed fans will also note that when she transmutes Invincible’s costume later in the scene when they’re about to have sex, it’s made of plants… So she may have broken through these blocks in a bigger way than she realizes.
The final conclusion of the episode, and the arc of the season, is that Invincible visits his half-brother Oliver in a hospital bed. And while Oliver thinks Invincible is going to tell him that killing is wrong… Invincible has decided that if anyone threatens his family again, just as Angstrom Levy (Sterling K. Brown) did in the previous episode, and Conquest this week, he won’t hesitate to kill them.
It’s a surprising move from the show, though again one pulled directly from the comic books, almost word for word. While the large majority of superhero media, from TV shows to movies, to the original comics wrestle with the “should heroes kill?” debate, Invincible has firmly fallen on the side of “yeah, when necessary.” Still, an ominous musical sting played under Invincible’s pro-death penalty statement points to more challenges coming the way of his realigned moral compass. So expect that this debate might not be as open and shut as the finale indicates.
Beyond that, the real eyebrow-raising moments are saved for that montage. So let’s break those Season 4 teases down, one by one.
Last seen in Season 2, Episode 6 “It’s Not That Simple,” the Sequids are incredibly dangerous Martian brain slugs who almost beat the Guardians of the Globe in their last encounter, including Invincible and Atom Eve. They had taken over the brain of an astronaut named Rus Livingston (Ben Schwartz), who was finally freed and brought back to Earth after a horrifying, harrowing ordeal. Unfortunately for Rus, after he returned to his apartment, which had been trashed by Shapesmith (also Schwartz), he threw up a Sequid in the sink – which immediately took over his body, again.
That plotline has been on hold since the aforementioned episode, but looks like it’s coming back in a big way in Season 4. While everything else has been going on this season, the Sequids have been steadily building an army in the sewers, including what looks like hundreds of human workers and others. Given we were told that if the Sequids ever made it to Earth it was game over for humanity… Yeah, that’s bad! “Not long now,” says Russequid. Uh-oh!
At the end of Season 3, Episode 4, “You Were My Hero,” the unstoppable Battle Beast was fighting a Viltrumite in the cold, dark reaches of space. We catch up to him here, as well as the scattered remains of the Viltrumite… BB is in suspended animation but is quickly picked up by an alien ship. And a few seconds after that, he wakes up, ready for battle. He wants “more!”
If things pan out on the TV show the same way they do in the comic, the ship was part of the Coalition of Planets, the group fighting back against the Viltrumites. Alongside Allen the Alien (Seth Rogen) and Nolan Grayson (J.K. Simmons), it looks like the Coalition finally has a fighting chance against the unstoppable aliens.
In one of the best casting coups on the show, the creepy, Cenobite-esque Technicians who fixed up Angstrom Levy, as first seen in Season 3, Episode 7, are voiced by Doug Bradley. You might know him better as Pinhead from the Hellraiser series. And in this teaser of coming attractions, we get to hear Bradley say somethingextremelyPinhead.
After revealing that Angstrom has a new arm thanks to them (Invincible accidentally amputated it last episode), Angstrom asks what they want in return. “Angstrom Levy, you have witnessed what our ambitions have done to our world, and what we have had to do to ourselves to survive here,” a Technician explains.
Angstrom thinks they want a new home, but the Technicians have other ideas. “That is only the beginning of the delights we will achieve together,” the Technician says. Now, the classic Hellraiser line is “We have such sights to show you” while the 2022 remake employed “greater delights await.” But come on, if you weren’t Leo Dicaprio pointing at the screen meme at that line, what are we even doing here?
In any case, to explain what the Technicians are up to is to spoil one of the great plot twists of the Invincible comics. Suffice it to say that they will tie into the action, and we have not seen the last of either Angstrom or the not-Cenobites.
Despite Invincible demanding Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins) show him Conquest’s dead body, it turns out that the dead body was a fake. In fact, Cecil has Conquest locked in a massive, underground chamber as the Viltrumite’s body reconstitutes itself.
Donald (Chris Diamantopoulos), Cecil’s right-hand man, protests that this is a mistake. And if you’ve read the comics, you know that Donald is correct: you cannot hold a massively powered Viltrumite like Conquest with mere Earth materials, no matter how secure Cecil makes the facility. Unfortunately for Cecil, as well as the world, in this case, Invincible was correct: Conquest should have been killed.
That brings us to the mid-credits scene. While everything else we’ve explained above happens in the comic books by Kirkman, Ryan Ottley, and Cory Walker, this scene is completely new. And in fact, it’s something Kirkman always wanted to do in the comics, but never found room for. Oh, and there’s a fantastic, surprise voice actor involved.
Right after the end credits begin, we cut to Damien Darkblood (Clancy Brown), the demon detective we haven’t seen since Season 1, Episode 4, “Neil Armstrong, Eat Your Heart Out.” In case you forgot – it aired back in 2021, after all – Damien was investigating Omni-Man, then set up by Cecil and sent back to Hell. As he was sucked down to the inferno, he threatened vengeance on Cecil… And that’s (potentially) what we’re seeing here.
Now missing his trenchcoat, Damien creates a summoning circle, which calls a demon lord voiced by none other than Bruce Campbell. And Damien hails to the king, baby, by bringing “the great beast… welcome news.” Damien explains that he has the means to restore the demon to his former glory, and the “infernal throne.” The key? A “surface dweller of great power, likes of which this planet has not seen for eons.” And furthermore, Damien explains that “his blackened heart will be bound to your service.” And how will they do that? By conjuring “him” to Hell.
In the comics, Damien Darkblood was even more of a blink-and-you-miss-him character than he was on the TV show. But as Kirkman explained to theCartoonist Kayfabe podcastin 2020, there was originally more planned.
“The thing that I really regret is I never had an adventure where the superheroes went into Hell,” Kirkman explained. “There’s been so many superhero comics where it’s like, they got to go fight Mephisto or something, and I was like, ah jeez, I never got around to that. And the Damien Darkblood character was there so I could eventually do a story like that, and I never got around to it.”
Part of the reason for this may be that the initial storyline and reveal of Omni-Man as a bad guy was supposed to go nearly double the length that it did in the comic. It ultimately came to a head in issues 12 and 13, versus the planned 25. That meant there just wasn’t as much room for Darkblood to be investigating Omni-Man, because… Well, there was nothing left to investigate. So credit to Kirkman and company for letting that planned story play out on the TV show in a way we never saw in the books.
The big question here is: who is Damien Darkblood referring to? Is it Invincible? Omni-Man? Cecil? We’ll know more when Season 4 of Invincible premieres on Prime Video.",1604,"The Invincible Season 3 finale aired on Sunday night.

"We recently saw a good look atPokémon Legends: Z-A, the next entry in Game Freak's Legends series set to take place in X and Y's Lumiose City. It's also apparently garnered an E10+ rating from the ESRB, and fans are both curious and wildly, sometimes jokingly, speculating about what's going to happen in this new entry.

Attentive fans noticed that on the Nintendo Switch store page, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has earned an E10+ age rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board, listing 'Fantasy Violence.' While it might not normally draw feverish speculation for most other series, it's an oddity for Pokémon, whose mainline games have consistently been 'E for Everyone.'
The rating has, of course, drawn wild speculation, some serious and some less-than-serious. It is genuinely entertaining to think about what strange choices Game Freak could possibly have made to bump up the rating, whether that bedialogue about Pokémon killing peopleor trying toadd a gunplay mechanic. Asseveral Redditors (jokingly) suggest, maybe the hordes come back, but it involves a group of Scrafty jumping you in one of Lumiose's alleys.
""Ohhhh boy, Game Freak is taking off the little kiddie gloves,""Reddit user RynnHamHamsaid. ""This ain’t your kindergartener’s Pokémon game.""
Several gags have also been made about AZ, a character with quite a history set to appear in Pokémon Legends: Z-A and who plays a central role in some of the darker elements of Pokémon X and Y's story and the history of the Kalos region.
As for more plausible speculation, there are a few theories, includinga few more""craps"" than usual, or the appearance of a Game Center-style minigame. Even the darker elements of Lumiose could be more front-and-center.
My personal take is that this probably lies in the 'Fantasy Violence' the ESRB highlighted. While the rating is an oddity for your typical Pokémon game, itdoesline up with the pocket monster fighting gamePokkén Tournament DX, which also received an E10+ and noted 'Fantasy Violence.' The real-time elementsshowcased for Pokémon Legends: Z-Acould have elicited the slightly stronger rating, as the monsters more clearly make contact.
There's no listing, as of this writing, for Pokémon Legends: Z-A on the ESRB site, so we can't learn much more at this time. Still, it's fun to speculate a bit, at least until we know more about Z-A's ultimate plans and how it will earn that bump-up in the E range.

The rating has, of course, drawn wild speculation, some serious and some less-than-serious. There are a few theories, including a few more""craps"" than usual, or the appearance of a Game Center-style minigame. Even the darker elements of Lumiose could be more front-and-center. But the rating is an oddity for your typical Pokémon game, itdoesline up with the pocket monster fighting gamePokkén Tournament DX."
