    "full_text": "Editor’s note: This interview was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior toNintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States due to the potential impact of tariffs. Parts of this interview were edited for clarity.\n\nAfter getting hands-on with Nintendo Switch 2 at last week’s reveal in New York, IGN spoke with the hardware leads spearheading the development of Nintendo’s newest console. Kouchi Kawamoto and Takuhiro Dohta from Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning and Development Department, along with Tetusya Sasaki from Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, talked to IGN’s Brian Altano about the technology behind Switch 2, the classic Nintendo handhelds that have inspired them and the impact former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata’s legacy had on the development of the console.\nIGN:Can you talk about the SOC system on a chip the Nintendo Switch 2 was running? Is it Nvidia Tegra? If not, can you reveal which graphics architecture it's based on?\nNintendo:I think you'll find a lot of the details in NVIDIA's information that they've shared.\nIGN:One of the notes in the direct suggested to hit 4K in dock mode, upscaling may be required. What kind of upscaling is this system using? Is it using AI upscaling?\nNintendo:I think probably the main kind of easiest upscaling to use is the DLSS that Nvidia provides. So from that standpoint, I guess you could say this AI.\nNintendo:That said, we're planning on providing other options of upscaling through software and so ranging from something that uses AI to something that's not. I think you'll see that as time passes. And lastly, I'll add that even though there is upscaling, there's also the option to not upscale and just output natively. So that's also an option that developers can use.\nIGN:What about ray tracing? Is that something that your team experimented with?\nNintendo:Just like DLSS, that's when we're kind of making the graphics of a game. We consider ray tracing as just another tool to do that – it's not that we're going to try to use ray tracing on everything, but really trying to figure out what types of graphics, what types of screens, what types of situations are best suited for ray tracing, and then trying to apply that. That's the approach we took when we did all of our researching and experimenting.\nIGN:We saw that the switch two supports third party cameras. What about third-party mice?\nNintendo:You're talking about USB mice, things like that?\nIGN:Yeah, not the animal!\nNintendo:[Laughs] It really depends on the game software with the structure. So if that software supports third-party USB mice, yes.\nIGN:I have a six-year-old daughter. She took my Switch and I don't get to play it anymore. She also has dropped it a lot and it's okay. What have you done with Switch 2 to make sure that it can survive a kid dropping it on the floor or dropping it down the stairs?\nNintendo: Nintendo has made very sturdy devices through the ages and I believe that this time around as well, we've made something that will be sturdy.\nNintendo:Yeah, you can drop it a little bit. I don’t recommend it though!\nIGN:I also have a Steam Deck and I like it, but the fan gets very loud when I'm playing high end games. It's almost distracting. What did Nintendo do to make sure that that was taken into account when designing the hardware for Switch 2?\nNintendo:When a fan is loud it really does affect one's gameplay, so that is definitely something we had in the back of our mind during the development of the Nintendo Switch 2. The system is made to adapt depending on the processing capability so I'm kind of curious to hear from the others here what their experience has been like.\nNintendo:When I was playing it it's not like, “Wow, there's a fan in there”. It hasn’t really gotten to the point where, even through development of the hardware, it has bothered me in any way.\nNintendo:The hardware team put quite a lot of effort into making sure the airflow was smooth. So a lot is coming in but there's a lot coming out, and as such the fan noise isn't too significant.\nIGN:Nintendo invented the directional pad and it's been important for video games for my entire life. What did your team do to ensure that the Dpad on the Switch 2 was great for fighting games, puzzle games, platformers, all that fun stuff?\nNintendo:You may think that every time you see the directional pad that it's just the same button being reused, but the truth is we do make small adjustments and add small changes every time. I have people – our development and game development teams – try them out when we make a new one.\nNintendo:This is a more detailed point but for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller directional buttons, we made it so that it's even more difficult to have mistaken input. Of course, it doesn't completely eliminate that possibility but it should reduce it.\nIGN:I'm a big fan of Nintendo handheld systems and always have been since the original Game Boy. What are each of your personal favorite classic Nintendo handhelds?\nNintendo:I have fond memories for each of the systems that have come out but for me personally, I think the original Game Boy really has a special place in my heart. Part of the reason for that is that since then there's obviously new systems that came out, like the Game Boy Advance for example. But I just distinctly remember my mother with the original Game Boy playing Tetris, and that’s just burned into my memory.\nIGN:Some of you worked with the legendary Satoru Iwata. Is there any specific part of his legacy that inspired the Nintendo Switch 2 design?\nNintendo:There are various aspects but what comes to mind first is the magnet connector. We originally didn't adopt it for the Nintendo Switch because it wasn't as secure as we would've liked. However, we put a lot of effort into this aspect and that has come to fruition.\nNintendo:It was Mr. Iwata's concerns about the magnets that meant it didn't come to fruition [for the original Switch]. So being able to actually address all of the issues and create something that probably would've met his standards is moving and meaningful.\nIGN:I love it. I think I took the JoyCon on and off 20 times yesterday!\nNintendo:I actually have a question for you. You saw the footage of the JoyCon 2 snapping on and off. Was the impression you got from that footage different from actually snapping it on and off?\nIGN:Yes. I thought it was going to be like a refrigerator magnet and it was going to be wobbly loose and instead it just goes ‘snap’ and clicks in. And I was like, “Oh, that feels really nice.”\nNintendo:I'm very relieved to hear that!\nIGN:Yeah, they told me I had to stop doing it!\nBrian Altano has been playing Mario Kart for 30+ years, and it's crazy that 10 of those years were spent with Mario Kart 8. We haven't seen Battle Mode for Mario Kart World yet, but he's still holding out hope that Block Fort can come back. Bring back Block Fort!"

    "full_text": "Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition has hit its lowest price yet,now available for $49.99 at Amazon—its best deal to date, even beating Black Friday, according to our records, and even price-tracking siteCamelCamelCamel.\n\nOriginally released on October 8 forNintendo SwitchandPlayStation 4 (fully compatible with PS5), this collection brings together the first six mainline Final Fantasy games in their carefully remastered form. Square Enix has opted for refinement rather than reinvention, keeping the original pixelated aesthetic intact but sharpening it for modern displays.\nThe result is a collection that looks fantastic, whether on a massive TV or in handheld mode. The soundtrack has also received an orchestral upgrade, with legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu overseeing the new arrangements. On top of that, the package introduces a handful of thoughtful quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to disable random encounters and boost experience and gil gains—useful for those who want to focus on the story without the grind.\nAs a small but nostalgic extra, this edition includes a sticker sheet featuring 12 classic character sprites, including the Black Mage, a Moogle, Terra, Kain, and a mid-cackle Kefka. It’s not the most extravagant of bonuses, but it’s a fun little touch for fans of the series.\nAt its original $74.99 price, the collection was a tougher sell, but at $49.99, it's a much easier recommendation for anyone interested in the series’ origins. Whether you’re revisiting these classics or playing them for the first time, this is a well-executed remaster of six of themost influential RPGsever made. And with physical copies being the only collectible edition available, it might be worth picking up before they become harder to find, especially at this time.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

Enjoy the experience, share your thoughts, and help shape the future of AI-powered gameplay experiences.\n\"This bite-sized demo pulls you into an interactive space inspired by Quake II, where AI crafts immersive visuals and responsive action on the fly. It’s a groundbreaking glimpse at a brand new way of interacting with games, turning cutting-edge research into a quick and compelling playable demo.\"\nAll thatsoundspretty impressive, but the demo itself is... well, less so.\nAfter The Game Awards boss Geoff Keighley shared a brief video of the demo in actionon X / Twitter,hundreds of people responded, with few having anything positive to say.\nMicrosoft has created an AI-generated replica of Quake II that you can play in browser.\"Every frame is created on the fly by an AI world model.\"Play it here:https://t.co/WGQymDOmsjpic.twitter.com/35MX5aHPbF\n\"Man, I don't want the future of games to be AI-generated slop,\" said oneRedditor. \"There will be a point where it will be easier to use AI, and then all the greedy studios will do it exclusively. The human element will be removed.\n\"And the worst part is gamers will buy it. They buy skins for 100 dollars. They will buy whatever you sell them.\"\n\"Microsoft's boast that they want 'to build a whole catalog of games that use this new AI model,' despite it not being clear if the current technique will ever even be capable of letting you turn around without moving to a random point on the map let alone come up with an original game, really typifies what's wrong with AI and the tech industry,\"addedanother.\n\"I had a better experience literally just imagining the game in my head,\"saidanother commenter.\nNot everyone was so quick to dismiss it, however.\n\"I don't know why everything has to be doom and gloom,\"saida more cheery respondent. \"It's a demo for a reason.

This can also bring improvement in other fields in AI as what it is doing is impressive.\n\"This is not even a product yet but a demo showing how much they've improved from just a few months ago.\"\nEpic Games boss Tim Sweeney had a rather different response:\npic.twitter.com/XidCvhLDTI\nGenerative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI.The game failed, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”\nStill, that hasn’t put off a number of video game companies from using generative AI in the development of their products.Activision recently disclosed the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assetsas part of new requirements on Steam, amid a backlash to an \"AI slop\" zombie Santa loading screen.\nAnd last month,Horizon actor Ashly Burch addressed a controversial AI Aloy video that leaked online, using it to call attention to the demands of striking voice actors.\nVikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

    "title": "Nintendo Switch 2 Tech Analysis: Is 4K Actually Realistic?",
    "publishedAt": "2025-04-04T18:47:02Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-analysis-is-4k-actually-realistic",
    "full_text": "TheNintendo Switch 2has finally been revealed, and while it brings huge improvements over the original console, it doesn’t exist in the same vacuum that the original handheld did. With the introduction of devices like theSteam DeckandAsus ROG Ally X, a ton of handheld gaming systems out there can play AAA PC games on the go.\n\nSo, while the Switch 2 will automatically have a niche carved out for being a system that plays, well, Nintendo games likeMario Kart World,anyone that’s buying a Switch 2 to play multiplatform games will have to reckon with devices like the Steam Deck – especially with the Switch 2’s $449 price tag.\nNow that Nintendo has given a sneak peek into the hardware that’s running its new console, we can take a look at how exactly it will run, and whether or not its 4K promises are more than empty words.\nThe SoC (System on a Chip) that runs the Nintendo Switch 2 is probably the most important part of the console, but it’s the thing we know the least about. We do know that it’s a “custom Nvidia processor” thatsupports DLSS and ray tracing, but beyond that, neither Nintendo nor Nvidia have revealed any specifics. Luckily, there are a ton of leaks that suggest the Nintendo Switch 2 is using the aging Ampere graphics architecture behind theRTX 3080.\nGoing all the way back to 2023, there wereleaks suggesting that the Nintendo Switch 2 would be using the Nvidia Tegra T239 SoC. This APU uses 8 ARM A78C cores, combined with an Nvidia Ampere GPU with 1,536 CUDA cores. Napkin math puts that at 12 Streaming Multiprocessors, which would be significantly smaller than even the smallest Ampere GPU – the RTX 3050 for laptops. However, assuming Nvidia didn’t nerf the Ampere SMs in the T239, each SM would have four Tensor Cores and an RT core, making for a total of 48 and 12, respectively.\nTo be fair, the Steam Deck is using a custom AMD APU that’s built on 8 AMD RDNA 2 GPU cores, which is smaller than what Nintendo is offering here. But, you have to keep in mind that the Steam Deck has a lower resolution display, and pumps more power into it. Plus,AMD Z2 processorsare coming out over the next year, with the Z2 Extreme featuring 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, which will be a huge upgrade. Though, systems with that chipset are going to bemuchmore expensive than the Switch 2.\nThat small of a GPU basically makes 4K gaming an impossibility natively, but because the Tensor Cores are there, DLSS is going to be a major factor in how the Nintendo Switch performs when docked – assuming this is the SoC that’s actually in the system. However, with so few Tensor Cores, even upscaling to 4K is going to be a stretch in everything but the most lightweight games.\nInstead, most games are likely going to target 1080p, even if they don’t natively render at that resolution. There are games like Donkey Kong Bananza that do seem to be rendering at a native 1080p resolution, according toDigital Foundry’s hands-on demos. However, third-party games like Cyberpunk 2077 seem to be relying heavily on upscaling, with native resolutions as low as 540p. I wouldn’t expect the Nintendo Switch 2 to ever be able to handle Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K, even with DLSS, though Nintendo will definitely have better luck with any game it can get running natively at 1080p.\nThe Ampere cores in the rumored T239 also have RT cores, which should theoretically allow for ray tracing in Nintendo Switch 2 games. Though, again, this will be heavily constrained by the processor’s 12 RT cores. Ray tracing will be possible, but don’t expect any jaw-dropping implementations of the technology, and especially don’t expect it in games likeCyberpunk 2077.\nEven with RT cores, ray tracing is an extremely expensive workload for the GPU, and the T239 is limited by more than just its small SM count – power is a huge limiting factor, too. I spoke withRichard Leadbetter over at Digital Foundry, who told me that the entire system likely consumes as little as 10W, including the display, the SoC, and the mainboard. We won’t know exactly what the T239’s actual TDP (thermal design power) is until someone finds a way to measure it, but it likely leaves only 5-6W for the SoC itself – a third of the power of the Steam Deck’s AMD APU.\nHowever, while the Nintendo Switch 2 might not be able to produce the same amount of power as ahandheld gaming PClike the Asus ROG Ally X, that doesn’t mean there won’t be gorgeous games running on the system. After all, games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza look stunning, and it goes to show how clever Nintendo developers are at getting the most out of the hardware in the Switch.\nAfter all, the original Nintendo Switch was powered by the Nvidia Tegra X1, which was built on thenow-ancient Maxwell graphics architectureand only packed 256 CUDA cores. Ampere is orders of magnitude more efficient than Maxwell even on its best days, and there are six times more cores in the Switch 2’s GPU. The Nintendo Switch 2 should bewayfaster than the original console, which bodes well for cross-generation ports like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\nWhile a total system power budget of 10W means the system isn’t quite as fast as it could be, it does mean the battery will have a much better time keeping up. Nintendo has come out and said it should last around 2 hours at a minimum. That’s less than was quoted for the original Switch, but that shouldn’t be too surprising, due to its higher-resolution display and more powerful processor.\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 has a 5,220mAh battery, a large step up from the 4,310mAh battery in the original console. That’s a sizable jump, and if its battery has the same voltage of the original Switch, that would equate to around 19Whr. That’s a smaller battery than theSteam Deck, which is probably why Nintendo quotes a similar battery life to the Steam Deck, despite its less power-hungry processor.\nNintendo probably could have put a more powerful battery in the Switch 2, but its decision likely came down to size constraints. There’s only so much battery that’ll fit while retaining the same thickness as the original Nintendo Switch, after all.\nThe most striking difference at first glancebetween the Switch and Switch 2is probably going to be the display. While it doesn’t have the OLED screen that made theSwitch OLEDsuch a marvel, the display is bigger and has a higher resolution. The Nintendo Switch 2 sports a 7.9-inch LCD display with a resolution of 1920x1080 with HDR 10 support. The display is also fast, supporting variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. That’s honestly a bit overkill considering the silicon powering the thing, but it does mean that older games or indie titles will feel extremely smooth – assuming they have unlocked frame rates. 120Hz is also a useful refresh rate for games that target 40fps since that makes for a clean ratio that won’t result in excessive stuttering.\nNintendo hasn’t released any information about the brightness of the display, but the HDR 10 certification means it needs toat leasthave a peak brightness of 1,000 nits, so it’s going to be a bright screen. We don’t know exactly how color performance will turn out either, but Nintendo does claim that it supports WCG, or Wide Color Gamut.\nThe display is probably going to be the thing that lifts the Nintendo Switch 2 above its competitors. The Steam Deck LCD has an 800p display with a peak brightness of 400 nits, and it doesn’t support WCG. The Steam Deck OLED does offer a much nicer display, but it’s still an 800p display. The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is also a huge upgrade over the original, which had a 6.2-inch, 720p LCD display.\nIn a vacuum, the Nintendo Switch 2 is massively better than the original Nintendo Switch. It’s leagues faster, has a screen that’s bigger, brighter and sharper, and has Joy-Con that you don’t have to wrestle with to disconnect. The only problem is that the Switch doesn’t exist in a vacuum anymore.\nThere are a ton of handheld gaming systems out there now, and while most of them are more expensive than the $449 Nintendo Switch 2, they likely offer a better gameplay experience in multi-platform games. The real appeal of the Switch 2 is going to be Nintendo’s catalog of first-party games, just like with the original console. Nintendo is known for making great games that make the most of its – relatively – weak hardware. If you’re the type of gamer that falls in love with Nintendo games, then the Nintendo Switch 2 makes a lot of sense. However, if you’re just going to get this thing to play Cyberpunk or Elden Ring on the train, there arebetter gaming handheld optionsout there.\nJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

    "full_text": "I’ve got a stack of opened booster packs and zero regrets. That’s how I know this deal is worth flagging.Pokémon TCG: Scarlet & Violet Surging Sparks Booster Bundleis finally back at Amazon, and it’sactuallyselling at retail again; $45.02 for six packs. In 2025, findingPokémon cards at their intended pricefeels like spotting a shiny on the first encounter. It’s rare. It’s thrilling. And honestly, I want more.\n\nThis bundle includes six booster packs from the latest Surging Sparks expansion. If you’re into Electric-types or just want an excuse to hear foil crackle between your fingers, I think this is it. The new card art looks great, there are some intriguing new Trainer strategies in the mix, and opening packs still hits the same dopamine receptors it did in 1999.\nSurging Sparks has some unreal chase cards, making a massive shift in art quallity in the Scarlet and Violet era. The Special Illustration Rare Pikachu ex is going for around $430, and Latias ex is even higher at nearly $500. Milotic ex is another banger at about $150 thanks to an ability that blocks damage from Tera Pokémon. Hydreigon ex is strong too, with a deck-discarding attack that’s super viable for play. Even the Hyper Rare Pikachu ex holds value at around $120. I don’t expect to pull any of these, but the odds keep things interesting.\nIn my opinion, this is the kind of deal that’s perfect for casual collectors like me, or anyone who enjoys the chaos of pulling something rare right after saying, “Just one more pack.” I know better than to promise a Pikachu EX SIR in every box, but I’ll absolutely take my chances when I don’t have to pay a third-party markup for the privilege.\n\"Surging Sparksis packed with over 250 new cards, including special illustration rares you'll want to display and hyper rares that could redefine your collection. These aren't just cards; they're instant eye-catchers that bring a tropical vibe to the table.\"\n\"Every booster pack feels like a potential game-changer with pulls like the terrastallized Pikachu EX and the stunning Latias EX & Latios Full Art. Surging Sparks is about delivering the goods, whether you're in it for the strategic edge or hunting down those high-value collectibles. It's got style, substance, and a buzz that's hard to ignore.\"\nIf you’re building a deck, feeding a binder addiction, or just gifting this to a kid so you can secretly open the packs yourself later, this is your chance. No inflated prices. No shady listings. Just six legit booster packs that actually ship from Amazon.\nI already added one to my cart. I’m pretending it’s “for research.” You can decide your own excuse. Want morePokémon TCG deals?Elite Trainer Boxes also got restocked yesterdaywith some still available.

    "full_text": "The GOG Preservation Program is growing with a solid list of inductees, including classic titles like Silent Hill 4: The Room, Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption, Fallout 2, Deus Ex, and more.\n\nThe PC digital storefrontdetailedhow it planned to expand its retro-gaming-focused service yesterday, providing fans with a lineup of games it has committed to support for the foreseeable future. It’s a list of 26 titles thatGOG sayswill “remain playable in their best versions” that players can safely assume they’ll have access to for years to come.\nSilent Hill 4: The Room is one title that will benefit from the GOG Preservation Program in more ways than one. In addition to securing its future, GOG says the entry’s status with the service means it comes with “missing content that was never available on PC before.” This includes the reintroduction of Hauntings, which spruce up that iconic Silent Hill atmosphere with spooky effects, such as flickering lamps and possessed telephones. Modern controller support has also been added.\nF.E.A.R. Platinum, which waspromised last month, arrives as an especially nice addition, too, as its original developer, Monolith Productions, wasshuttered by Warner Bros. last month. As more studio closures occur and the industry leans toward a digital future, it’s a perfect example of what GOG aims to accomplish with the Preservation Program.\nYou can see the March 2025 additions to the GOG Preservation Program, along with discounts as part of the currentSpring Sale, below.\nThe GOG Preservation Program is a relatively new initiative from the CD Projekt Red-owned storefront that serves as the company’s commitment to keep a selection of games up-to-date and available for PC players. More than 100 games are supported through the program, and judging by today’s announcement, the list will only continue to grow.\n\"The GOG Preservation Program is our commitment to preserving gaming history,\" GOGsaid at the time of its reveal late last year. \"Through the program, players can trust that their games will always be up to date and ready to run on current and future PC setups.\n\"Whether it’s manuals, DLCs, or missing features, we’re offering the most complete version possible, backed by GOG’s tech support and offline installers, so you can safeguard these classics for years to come.\"\nMichael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-march-20-2025",
    "full_text": "Samsung came in strong with today’s deals, and I have to admit, I’m eyeing a couple of them up.The 49-inch Odyssey G9 gaming monitorlooks like something pulled straight from a sci-fi movie.The Galaxy Tab S10+ 5Gis basically a laptop in disguise, and theGalaxy Z Flip 6is making flip phones cool again. If that’s not enough, theS24 Ultrais here to remind every other smartphone who’s boss, and theSSD dealsare giving me a solid excuse to finally clean up my storage situation.\n\nSome of these discounts are impressive, like$500 off that insane QD-OLED monitor. Others, like theSonic statueandRimWorld deal, are more like little bonus treats for the fans. Either way, if you’ve been waiting for a solid sale on a gaming monitor, a high-end phone, or a storage upgrade, Samsung has something worth looking at today.\nAliExpress has brand new PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch OLED consoles on sale for prices you won't find anywhere else. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming console that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by youraccount, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item.\nI want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.\nThis phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.\nI didn’t know I needed an 11-inch Sonic statue until now. The detail is impressive, the LED lights make it pop, and it’s half off. If you’re a Sonic fan, this is an easy yes. If you’re not, well, now’s a great time to start.\nI can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.\nRimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.\nThis SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.\nI never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.\nI think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.\nApple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.\nBeats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art. The remastered soundtracks, modernized UI, and quality-of-life improvements bring these classics into the modern age while keeping their original charm intact. Each game features iconic character designs by Kazuko Shibuya and a faithful soundtrack rearranged by Nobuo Uematsu. Whether you’re reliving the golden age of RPGs or playing them for the first time, this bundle is the ultimate way to experience Final Fantasy’s roots. The limited-time sale price of $52.49, down from $74.99, makes this an easy win for any RPG fan.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experience Final Fantasy I through VI in glorious HD pixel art.

Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.\nIf you’re tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.\nWhy buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.\nIf you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.\nStill using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.\nThese aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.\nThese Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.\nLuxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.\nThis isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.\nFor those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says \"powerful Pokémon\" like an angry robot penguin).\nI'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.\nIf somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.\nYour PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).\nIf you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, \"I really need to delete some games,\" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.\nLogitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.\nSamsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room.

At $764 off, this is the cheapest we’ve seen it outside of Black Friday.\nLG B4 OLED TVbrings incredible picture quality at a price that doesn’t require selling a kidney.

At $499.99, this is one of the best deals for an OLED right now.\nSamsung’s S90D OLED TVis a beast, packing AI-powered 4K upscaling, Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for silky smooth gameplay, and Dolby Atmos for immersive sound. Real Depth Enhancer makes everything look more lifelike, and PANTONE validation ensures accurate color reproduction. At $300 off, this is a great price for a high-end 65” OLED TV.\nSony’s WH-CH520 headphonesoffer 50 hours of battery life, customizable sound settings, and a lightweight, comfortable design.

    "title": "Nintendo Switch 2 Tech Specs: Battery Life, 4K and Up to 120fps, Storage, and More",
    "publishedAt": "2025-04-02T18:22:44Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-specs-battery-life-4k-and-up-to-120fps-storage-and-more",
    "full_text": "Nintendo just revealed so much about the Nintendo Switch 2 during its latest Direct, but we have learned even more since the hour-long presentation ended, including the new console's tech specs. While we still have a lot of questions, let's break down what's new with the Switch 2.\n\nThis had been touched on before, butNintendo reiteratedthat this new system will feature a 7.9-inch wide color gamut LCD screen that is capable of outputting at 1080p (1920x1080). This is a big upgrade from Switch 1's 6.2-inch screen, the Switch OLED's 7-inch screen (although we will miss OLED!), and the Switch Lite's 5.5-inch screen.\nThere is also support for HDR10 and VRR up to 120 Hz, which means games can jump up to 120fps if they and your setup allow it.\nIt was also confirmed that slotting the Switch 2 to its new dock will allow games to be played in 4K (3840x2160) at 60fps or 1080p/1440p (1920x1080/2560x1440) at 120fps. We know these higher-end graphics are made possible by a \"custom processor made by NVIDIA,\" but sadly we are currently given no further details in regard to Switch 2's CPU/GPU.\nWhat was revealed, however, was the battery life. The Switch 2's internal battery is a Lithium-ion battery with 5220mAh, and this will allow for approximately 2 - 6.5 hours of battery life and a charge time of three hours when in Sleep mode. Nintendo noted these are \"rough estimates\" and that the \"battery life will depend on the games you play.\"\nThis battery life is just about the same as the launch model Switch 1 as it boasted a range of 2.5 - 6.5 hours. On the other hand, the Switch 2's battery life is a downgrade from the three newer Switch models - Nintendo Switch (4.5 - 9 hours), Nintendo Switch - OLED Model (4.5 - 9 hours), and Nintendo Switch Lite (3 - 7 hours).\nElsewhere, we learn that the Switch is approximately 4.5 inches tall x 10.7 inches wide x .55 inches thick with the Joy-Con 2 attached. This translates to a weight of roughly .88 pounds without Joy-Con 2 and 1.18 lbs with them attached.\nThe weight of the Switch 2 is an exact match for the current Switch 1 model, but it is both taller and longer than any current model with Joy-Con attached;\nSpeaking of Joy-Con, we sadly don't get the confirmation that they are using Hall Effect joysticks that would likely preventthe drifting issues many Switch owners experienced.They very well may use them, asit was hinted at in a patent from 2023,but we'll have to wait to find out for sure.\nOn the audio front, the Switch 2 supports linear PCM output 5.1ch. If you want a surround sound effect, that can also be enabled via headphones of the built-in speaker after a system update.\nFor storage, the Switch 2 will feature 256 GB of internal storage, which is another upgrade from the 32 GB available on the Switch and Switch Lite and the 64 GB on the Switch - OLED Model. Another big difference here is that the Switch 2 will require microSD Express cards for up to 2TB of extra storage, meaning the microSDXC cards the current Switch models support will not be able to be transferred over to the new console.\nTo wrap up, it was also revealed the Switch 2 will support Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi 6), it will have 2 USB-C ports, a 3.5mm 4-contact stereo mini-plug (CTIA standard), and a built-in monaural microphone with noice cancellation, echo cancellation, and auto gain control.\nFor more,check out our recap of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct,how much the new system will cost,a list of the launch games we know so far,andwhen Switch 2 pre-orders start.\nAdam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

    "title": "Nvidia Says Its Custom GPU Means Nintendo Switch 2 Has 10x the Graphics Performance of the Nintendo Switch",

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-says-its-custom-gpu-means-nintendo-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch",
    "full_text": "As Nintendo had teased, Nvidia has now discussed the custom GPU powering the Nintendo Switch 2, although it failed to go into the level of detail tech enthusiasts were hoping for.\n\nIn ablog post, Nvidia confirmed what IGN had reported earlier today from Nintendo itself: that its GPU enables AI upscaling via DLSS and ray tracing.\nNvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is an AI-powered technology that uses machine learning to upscale lower-resolution images in real-time, enhancing both performance and image quality in games.\nThere is a little more detail on offer here on the Switch 2’s GPU. Nvidia described it as a “custom Nvidia processor featuring an Nvidia GPU with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements.”\nNvidia continued: “With 1,000 engineer-years of effort across every element — from system and chip design to a custom GPU, APIs and world-class development tools — the Nintendo Switch 2 brings major upgrades.”\nThose upgrades include up to 4K gaming in TV mode and up to 120 FPS at 1080p in handheld mode. Nintendo Switch 2 also supports HDR, and AI upscaling “to sharpen visuals and smooth gameplay.”\nThe new RT Cores bring real-time ray tracing, delivering “lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows for more immersive worlds,” Nvidia continued.\nTensor Cores, meanwhile, power AI-driven features like DLSS, “boosting resolution for sharper details without sacrificing image quality.”\nInterestingly, Nvidia said the Tensor Cores also enable AI-powered face tracking and background removal in video chat use cases, “enhancing social gaming and streaming.”\nDuring the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed the C button, which is used for new chat functionality that incorporates an external camera and the microphone in the Switch 2 itself. Nintendo made a point of saying the tech is smart enough to pay attention to the player’s voice and filter out background noise.\nAnd here’s the big claim from Nvidia:\n“With 10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2 delivers smoother gameplay and sharper visuals.”\nThere’s no detail on how it’s determined that graphics performance. It will no doubt be left to experts such asDigital Foundryto run the numbers once the Switch 2 launches in June.\nElsewhere, Nvidia said the Tensor Cores “boost AI-powered graphics while keeping power consumption efficient,” and the RT Cores “enhance in-game realism with dynamic lighting and natural reflections.”\nVariable Refresh Rate (VRR) via Nvidia G-SYNC in handheld mode “ensures ultra-smooth, tear-free gameplay.”\nIn a hardware-focused roundtable Q&A in New York yesterday, attended by IGN,Nintendo representatives confirmed the Switch 2 uses DLSS, but did not specify which version of the tech, or whether it had been customized for Switch 2. It was a similarly vague response when Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2’s GPU is capable of ray tracing.\nAnd what about the GPU itself? Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, chimed in to say Nintendo prefers not to get in the weeds on things like the GPU.\n“Nintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec,” he said. “What we really like to focus on is the value that we can provide to our consumers. But I do believe that our partner Nvidia will be sharing some information.”\nIn January, the internet spotted a patent, filed July 2023 but published for the first time earlier this year,that described AI image upscaling technologythat would help keep video game download sizes small enough to fit on a physical game cartridge while offering up to 4K textures.\nFor more, check outeverything announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct, andwhat the experts have to say about the Switch 2 price and Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "full_text": "I didn’t think we’d see a proper Pokémon TCG restock this early in 2025. Honestly, I was betting on summer at best, but here we are with actual product showing up on Amazon and not behind some sketchy paywalled Discord server. While the internet’s currently losing its mind over Prismatic Evolutions and burning money chasing stock alerts for Rival Destinies, the smart play is scooping up the older sets that just hit Amazon Global. We’re talking Scarlet and Violet era stuff, Sword and Shield throwbacks, and boxes that were basically extinct six months ago.\n\nThis is the kind of flood the TCG community needed. Not just for collectors trying to complete sets, but for anyone who’s tired of battling bots for ETBs like it’s the Hunger Games. There’s a real mix available right now: Booster Bundles, Premium Collections, tins with actual storage value. And yes, even a few deals that make it feel like Amazon’s trying to keep the vibe positive. If you’re chasing big pulls like Greninja SIR or Pikachu ex SIR, or just need to stock up on sleeves and dice, this is the best stock refreshes we’ve seen in a while.\nAliExpress is currently offering theSony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphonesfor only $225.18 after coupon code:IFP7FJZis applied during checkout. This product is stocked in a US warehouse, so it ships free and arrives within about a week. This is an import model with a warranty that won't be honored in the United States. AliExpress makes up for it with a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days.\nIn our glowingSony WH1000XM5 review, Kevin Lee wrote that \"The Sony WH-1000XM5 is hands down the best sounding and most impressive noise-canceling headphones around. They demand a high premium but the cost of audio excellence is well worth it with this pair of headphones.\"\nThe real deal here is the fact that theTwilight MasqueradeElite Trainer Box is actually in stock. Seeing it available without a 200% markup or sketchy third-party seller feels borderline miraculous. You’re getting nine booster packs, a full-art Teal Mask Ogerpon promo, and all the usual ETB goodies like energy cards, condition markers, and themed sleeves.\nIt’s not every day you seeBrilliant StarsBuild and Battle Boxes in stock, let alone without having to navigate the wild west of resale sites. At $63.34, this one comes with four booster packs and a pre-release promo card, which makes it a solid pickup for collectors looking to flesh out their Sword and Shield era sets. Arceus VSTAR headlines the expansion, and the pull potential here still holds up.\nAmong Us 4-Pack on Steam is a sneaky little deal that gives you four copies of the game for the price of one, making it dangerously easy to rope your friends into a night of trust issues and vent-related betrayal. It supports cross-platform play, customizable settings, and chaotic emergency meetings that usually end with the wrong person getting ejected. If you’ve somehow missed the social deduction chaos, now’s the perfect time to catch up and take three crewmates down with you.\nTheHisuian Electrode V Boxis back in stock at Amazon for $42.45, which is a win considering how sporadically these pop up. It's one of those V boxes that slipped under the radar when it first launched, but now that Sword and Shield-era product is drying up it’s worth grabbing. You get a foil Hisuian Electrode V promo, a regular Electrode foil, an oversized version (because why not), and four booster packs to rip through.\nThis limited-edition snack box is a flavor-packed tribute toAssassin’s Creed Shadows, blending premium Japanese treats with collectible game merch in a way that feels like an edible side quest. You get 15 unique snacks, a full bag of exclusive Kit Kats, a custom Tenugui towel, and even an in-game item called The Hourglass that’s only available through this box. With artwork prints, a detailed snack guide, and a box sleeve that transforms into a display-worthy poster, it’s more than just snacks.\nSeeing theShining FatesPikachu V Box on Amazon again feels like spotting a shiny in the wild. At $49.96 it’s not exactly a steal, but having it in stock is the real value. This box comes with a foil Pikachu V promo, an oversized version for flair, and four Shining Fates booster packs. That means a legit shot at pulls from one of the most hype-filled sets of the Sword and Shield era.\nTheSurging SparksBooster Bundle is actually in stock at Amazon for $47.95, which is kind of a miracle considering how fast this set’s been disappearing. You get six booster packs from the newest Scarlet and Violet expansion, which includes some major chase cards like Pikachu ex SIR and Latias ex. If you missed the chaos of launch day or couldn’t snag a bundle without battling bots, this is your chance to catch up.\nI want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.\nThis phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.\nI can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.\nRimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.\nThis SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.\nI never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.\nI think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.\nApple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.\nBeats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art. The remastered soundtracks, modernized UI, and quality-of-life improvements bring these classics into the modern age while keeping their original charm intact. Each game features iconic character designs by Kazuko Shibuya and a faithful soundtrack rearranged by Nobuo Uematsu. Whether you’re reliving the golden age of RPGs or playing them for the first time, this bundle is the ultimate way to experience Final Fantasy’s roots. The limited-time sale price of $52.49, down from $74.99, makes this an easy win for any RPG fan.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experience Final Fantasy I through VI in glorious HD pixel art.

Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.\nIf you’re tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.\nWhy buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.\nIf you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.\nStill using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.\nThese aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.\nThese Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.\nLuxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.\nThis isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.\nFor those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says \"powerful Pokémon\" like an angry robot penguin).\nI'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.\nIf somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.\nYour PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).\nIf you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, \"I really need to delete some games,\" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.\nLogitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.\nSamsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room. The Acoustic Lens Subwoofer ensures deep, punchy bass, while Adaptive Sound and Game Mode Pro make sure everything from dialogue to explosions sounds crisp. At $764 off, this is the cheapest we’ve seen it outside of Black Friday.\nLG B4 OLED TVbrings incredible picture quality at a price that doesn’t require selling a kidney.

Gamers get Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and VRR, plus four HDMI 2.1 ports. At $499.99, this is one of the best deals for an OLED right now.\nSamsung’s S90D OLED TVis a beast, packing AI-powered 4K upscaling, Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for silky smooth gameplay, and Dolby Atmos for immersive sound. Real Depth Enhancer makes everything look more lifelike, and PANTONE validation ensures accurate color reproduction. At $300 off, this is a great price for a high-end 65” OLED TV.\nSony’s WH-CH520 headphonesoffer 50 hours of battery life, customizable sound settings, and a lightweight, comfortable design. Multipoint connection makes switching between devices seamless, and DSEE upscaling improves compressed audio. At just $35.95, these are one of the best budget wireless headphones out there today.\nGoogle’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 bring top-tier noise cancellation, a Tensor A1 chip for AI-powered audio enhancements, and large 11mm drivers for rich bass. Conversation Detection automatically switches to transparency mode when you talk, so you don’t have to take them out.

    "publishedAt": "2025-03-24T10:53:14Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/on-bloodbornes-10th-birthday-and-with-neither-a-sequel-nor-a-next-gen-update-in-sight-fans-once-again-organize-a-return-to-yharnam",
    "full_text": "Bloodborneturns 10 years old today, and fans are celebrating by organizing yet another return to Yharnam community event.\n\nFromSoftware’s PlayStation 4 masterpiece launched on March 24, 2015, and helped cement the Japanese developer as one of the greatest of our time. Critical and commercial acclaim followed, and a follow-up in the vein of the Dark Souls sequels seemed inevitable.\nBut since then… nothing. Why hasn’t Sony followed upBloodbornewith either a current-gen remaster, a full-on sequel, or at the very least a next-gen update that would finally make it officially playable in 60fps? Fans have begged Sony for more Bloodborne ever since it came out. The deafening silence in response remains one of the most puzzling business decisions in all video games.\nEarlier this year, we got an explanation of sorts. Following his exit from Sony,PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida revealed his Bloodborne no-show theory. To be clear up front: this is Yoshida’s opinion, which inan interview with Kinda Funny Gameshe stressed was not inside information, or the reveal of the current deliberations within the bowels of Sony itself.\n“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida said. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.\n“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”\nMiyazaki-san is of course Hidetaka Miyazaki, the boss of FromSoftware. And yes, he’s incredibly successful. Not only for the influential Dark Souls series, but, most recently, the mainstream hitElden Ring, which propelled FromSoftware to new heights. So much so thatit’s getting a multiplayer spin-off this year.\nAnd it seems obvious to say Miyazaki will be incredibly busy with multiple projects to direct and a company to run. After Bloodborne came out in 2015, Miyazaki directedDark Souls 3, then 2019’sSekiro: Shadows Die Twicefor Activision, then the aforementioned Elden Ring for Bandai Namco. What's next? Miyazaki has yet to say.\nIn interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year,Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware.\nIn the years since, modders have tried to fill the gaps with fan-made projects that improve upon the base PS4 Bloodborne experience. But Sony has taken a dim view.Well-known Bloodborne 60fps mod creator Lance McDonald announced in Januarythat he’d received a takedown notification on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment “asking that I remove links to the patch I posted on the internet, so I've now done so.” The DMCA takedown arrived four years after the mod was released.\nThen, just a week later, Lilith Walther,creator ofNightmare Kart, which was previously known asBloodborne Kart, and the eye-catching Bloodborne PSX demake, tweeted to say an old YouTube video of the demake was hit with a copyright claim.\nRecently, fans managed to get PS4 emulators to deliver something akin to a remaster on PC. The tech experts atDigital Foundry released a videocovering “a breakthrough in PS4 emulation” via ShadPS4, which means Bloodborne is now fully playable start to finish in 60fps. Could this breakthrough have triggered an aggressive response from Sony? IGN asked Sony for comment at the time, but it has yet to respond.\nThat’s all we have to go on, really, which leaves Bloodborne fans to take it upon themselves to organize Return to Yharnam community events.Another kicks off today, on Bloodborne’s 10th anniversary, and calls on fans to create a new character, and summon as many random cooperators and invaders as possible, and leave in-game messages flagging they’re a part of this latest community drive.\nPerhaps this will be all that’s left for fans to do in the world of Bloodborne forever more.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

For those who have been waiting to pick it up, this is a great opportunity to do so at a significant discount, and potentially one of the best deals of the year.\n\nIt's hard to imagine the game dropping any further in price anytime soon, making this likely the best opportunity to buy it at the lowest price possible in 2025. With such a steep discount, I wouldn't be surprising if it sells out quickly, so if you're interested in picking it up, don't wait too long.\nIn our 9/10 review, Michael Higham called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth“a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth,” and “an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long.” While it takes some creative liberties in reimagining the classic, he described it as “thrilling and unexpectedly impactful.”\nWoot, an Amazon-owned online retailer, is known for offering limited-time deals on video games, tech, and more.

    "publishedAt": "2025-04-03T20:30:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/new-2025-samsung-neo-qled-and-oled-8k-and-4k-smart-tvs-are-now-available",
    "full_text": "Several of thenew 2025 Samsung TVsthat were showcased earlier this year atCESare now available for purchase at Samsung's official online store. Select Samsung Neo QLED and OLED TVs are currently in stock and they ship out immediately for as early as April 9-10 delivery. Alternatively, you can pick up select models at your local Best Buy. Not every TV has been released yet, but I expect more models to become available soon.\n\nSamsung showcased several of their top models duringCES 2025. Here's a quick rundown of the biggest highlights. At the moment, exact pricing for each model is unknown.\nSamsung revealed a total of six Mini-LED TV models for 2025, and three of the models are available for purchase starting today. The Neo QLED QN990F andQN900Fare true 8K TVs with some incremental improvements like the new anti-glare tech, the One Connect wireless transmitter box, and access to Samsung's Art Store, which was previously retricted to the Frame TVs. The Neo QLEDQN90F, QN85F,QN80Fand QN70F are the new 4K Mini-LED models. The highest end model is the QN90F and it will feature the same 165Hz refresh rate, Gen 3 processor, and anti-glare coating as the S95F. The mid-range QN85F will be Samsung's first 100\" TV.\nThe new OLED TVs - the S95F, S90F, and S85F - feature several incremental upgrades over its predecessors. The S95F, Samsung's flagship model, boasts a new NQ4 AI Gen 3 processor, a faster 165Hz refresh rate, an improved anti-glare coating, and an upgraded QD OLED panel that promises up to 2,000 nits of brightness. The S90F will also feature the Gen 3 processor, 144Hz refresh rate with VRR, and a QD OLED panel with up to 1,300nits of brightness (for TV models 55\" and up). TheS85Fremains the \"budget\" OLED TV with a Gen 2 processor and is the only model that's available now.\nNot yet released\nThe Frame Pro will make its debut this year alongside the standard Frame TV. The Frame Pro finally features the superior Neo QLED Mini-LED panel for richer and brighter colors, a faster 144Hz refresh rate, the new anti-glare tech, and wireless hookups in the form of a \"One Connect\" box that can be stowed away discreetly. The standard The Frame TV will still be available too, at a significantly lower cost I assume.\nSamsung QN90D (2024) Reviewby Jaron Schneider\nSamsung’s 2024 mini LED QN90D is a very nice television that refines the interface and adds a host of new features that increase the value of the offering. It’s expensive, but the brightness, color quality, wealth of HDMI 2.1 ports, built-in gaming, and more make a solid argument to warrant the asking price.\nLike just about everyone else in the industry, Samsung is going all in on AI. Samsung's new tech for 2025 is their \"Vision AI\", which can recognize the content you're watching, including specifics like the actors or setting, and display relevant personalized commentary in real-time. In addition, more TV models this year will be equipped with AI Upscaling Pro and AI Motion Enhancer Pro which work in tandem to optimize image quality on the fly. Other features include Active Voice Amplier Pro, which uses AI to isolate and enhance voices, AI Optimization, and AI Energy Mode.\nSamsung is also decisively moving many of their TV panels to the matte-like anti-glare coating we saw on the S95D in 2024. This anti-glare anti-reflective tech doesn't desaturate like we typically see with anti-glare coatings from other brands, and yet reflections are minimized to the point that you'll never notice them..\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Destiny 2 in-game items.\n\nThe SteelSeries Nova 7 is the latest successor to the highly rated Arctis 7 series of headsets. It's every bit as good as its predecessor but with some welcome upgrades like a USB Type-C charging port, a longer battery life (38 hours vs. 30 hours), simultaneous wireless and Bluetooth connectivity, and multi-platform compatibility. PC gamers also have access to the SteelSeries GG app, which opens up a whole suite of customization for your audio. If that's too much for you, there are presets for specific games that are actually tailormade by the game developers. For PS5 gamers, the Nova 7 is also compatible with the PlayStation 5's Tempest 3D Audio.\nThe Arctis Nova 7 is one of thebest headsetsyou can get forPS5and PC. In hisNova 7 review, Matthew Adler wrote that \"SteelSeries continues to push the boundaries of what a headset is capable of. With the addition of simultaneous Bluetooth audio, you can enjoy music, podcasts, or just chat with your friends without losing your game audio – all with a single pair of headphones. The Arctis Nova 7’s new design is sleek, lightweight, and still remains one of the most comfortable headsets I’ve ever used.\" I own a pair of these myself and highly recommend it.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

They include two 3.3-feet cables, two 6.6-feet cables, and an extra long 10 foot cable.

Amazon is currently offering a27\" KTC gaming monitorfor only $92.99 shipped after you clip a $40 off coupon on the product page and apply another $7 off coupon code: \"05DMKTC38\". This item has over 1,800 reviews on Amazon with an average 4.4/5 star score and a respectableFakespot \"B\" rating. It has plenty of gaming features you wouldn't expect at this price point.\n\nThe KTC H27T13 is a 27\" monitor with a 2560x1440 resolution, which averages out to a sharp 109ppi pixel density. It's equipped with a pre-calibrated IPS panel with good color reproduction and wide viewing angles. It's decently fast with a refresh rate up to 100Hz and G-Sync compatibility. KTC includes a 3 year warranty.\nIf you're considering this monitor, chances are you're pairing it with a budget gaming PC setup. You probably don't need an expensive monitor with a 4K resolution that will overly tax your PC or 240Hz refresh rate that will be hard to achieve. G-Sync technology, however, is especially useful for these budget builds, since your fps is more likely to fluctuate than higher-end builds and adaptive sync helps provide a smoother and tear-free experience. This is a good monitor to pair with something like an RTX 4060, 4070, 5070, or the new Radeon RX 9070 GPU.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

The same item is currentlysells for $85 on Amazon. This item ships from a local US warehouse so you'll receive it within 1 or 2 weeks. This is one of those items that is definitely more flash than function, but you're guaranteed to get comments from anyone who sees it. You definitely don't want to pay the $150 MSRP for it, but at this price it's worth a look.\n\nThis cyberpunk styled clock isn't just a clock; it's actually comprised of five small LCD screens that can be configured to display all manners of digits, characters, or animated gifs of your choosing. The 128x128 resolution is sharp enough to display legible text and reasonably detailed images. Divoom also claims that you can connect to the internet using 802.11n WiFI if you want to run real-time updates like social media posts, weather, stocks, game scores, and more. Like I mentioned earlier, I actually own this gadget. In my personal experience, I had as much chance at successfully connecting to WiFi as I would hitting a bullseye with both hands tied behind my back. In the end, I just use it as a glorified clock.

Absolutely not, but it looks so darn cool on my desk that I feel no buyers remorse, even though I paid more than this deal.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

Beach Camera is the marketplace vendor and it is an authorized Samsung reseller, which means you get the full manufacturer's warranty. The S90C is a 2023 model, but it's a better TV than the2024 S85Dand nearly identical in image quality to the2024 S90D, which is currently selling for $200 more. Ideally you'll pair it with yourPlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or even theupcoming Switch 2 console.\n\nUpdate:This TV is also available onAmazonfor a little more.\nThe Samsung S90C is a slightly older 2023 model (superseded by theS90Dfor 2024), but it's still considered to be one of the best OLED TVs available. That's because the S90C uses Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. It's generally considered better than LG's \"Evo\" technology found on the C-series TVs, which attempt to do the same thing. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. At the moment, there's no better panel technology that's readily available at a reasonable price.\nOLED technology aside, the Samsung S90C also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz (rare in a 2023 TV) as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X.

This might be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, at least untilSony's PlayStation Days of Play Salethat will probably happen sometime in late May.\nThe original PS5 DualSense controller is decked out in the same white color scheme as the console itself and retails for $69.99. Since then,Sony has consistently released more and more colors, some of them more striking than others. In late 2023, Sony launched theDeep Earth collection, \"a new metallic colorway for PS5 accessories\" with aptly sounding names like Sterling Silver, Volcanic Red, and Cobalt Blue. These controllers retailed for $79.99 and were (and still are) one of the more striking color schemes. We rarely see these on sale compared to the other colors.\nColor aside, the Dualsense is oft regarded as thebest PS5 controller under $100. It also makes for an excellent controller for your PC. The DualSense is modeled after the tried and true design and layout of previous PlayStation controllers, but it also packs in modern features such as haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone and speaker, integrated touchpad, internal gyroscope and accelerometer for motion sensing, and USB Type-C charging.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

Right now you can pick up thisMarsail 48\"x24\" Electric Standing Deskfor just $74.98 shipped. It comes with features that you wouldn't expect from a budget desk, like a keypad that can save up to four memory presets and side storage for magazines or notebooks. This desk has 530 4.6-star reviews on Amazon and has aFakespot A rating.\n\nThis Marsail electric standing desk includes a spliced 48x24 laminated desktop. Spliced desktops come in two pieces for easier shipping, so there's a seam the runs down the length of the table. It's not an issue for most people, but if you don't like it, you could always use your own desktop. The frame has a maximum weight limit of 100 pounds and adjustable height range of 27.5\"-46.7\". The single motor operates at under 50db with a vertical travel speed of 2\" per second. The frame is the familiar two-legged affair with two-stage telescoping columns and a horizontal column that prevents desktop sag. The control panel has up and down buttons as well as four memory presets, so you can switch from your preferred sitting height to your preferred standing height with just a press of the button.\nThe desk comes flat packed so you'll have to assemble it yourself. Having installed well over a dozen of these desks, I can say for certain that it's not difficult at all. The hardest part is definitely just having enough arms (or arm strength) to flip the desk over. Almost every desk installs in roughly the same way, and this Marsail desk appears to be no different. Marsail covers this product with a five-year warranty on the frame and motor.\nThis 40\"x24\" desk from AliExpress is priced the same and is great for people looking for a lighter toned option, with the wood colored desktop top and white legs.

Note that this is a Hong Kong or Japanese import model in new retail packaging, but you won't find it cheaper anywhere else. AliExpress also offers a 90-day return policy on this item.\n\nThe Xbox Elite Series 2 Core wireless controller is physically the same controller as the older generation Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, which retails for a much higher $180. That means that the Core controller retains all the integrated pro gaming features like adjustable-tension thumbsticks, wrap-around rubberized grip, and shorter hair trigger locks. It's a much superior option to the standard Xbox Core controller that the current gen consoles come with.\nAside from the color scheme, theonlydifference is that the original Elite controller comes with more accessories: extra sets of paddles, thumbsticks, D-pad, and a travel case. The Elite Series 2 Core doesn't come with any of those accessories.

Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.\n\n4TB for $259.99\nThe Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.\nThe Samsung 990 Evo Plus does not have a preinstalled heatsink. However, the 990 Evo Plus SSD is a newer single-sided SSD design that is power efficient and doesn't generate as much heat as SSDs from before. That means you probably don't need to use a heatsink and it should still work perfectly fine in a PS5 console without any thermal throttling. That said, you certainly could for peace of mind and I wouldn't see any disadvantage to that aside fromspending an extra $7.\nLooking for more options?

Amazon has theIniu 10,000mAh Power Bankwith up to 45W of Power Delivery over USB Type-C for only $11.25 after you redeem the 50% off coupon on the product page. Iniu power banks have solid reviews and are less expensive than equivalent Anker models.\n\nThis Iniu power bank holds a 10,000mAh, or 37Whr battery capacity. If you factor in 80% power efficiency, here are the approximate number of times you can fully recharge each gaming handheld:\nThe Iniu power bank has three output ports: one built-in 45W USB Type-C cable, one 45W USB Type-C port, and one USB Type-A port. The 45W of Power Delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch (18W) and Steam Deck (40W) at their fastest rate. This power bank is also a solid choice for charging your Apple iPhone 16, sinceChargerLAB has shown that the maximum charging rate caps at about 30W, even for the Pro Max model.\nWe don't yet know what the maximum charging rate for theNintendo Switch 2will be, but we are hoping that it will be greater than the 18W maximum of the original Switch.We do know that the battery capacity is higher(5,220mAh vs 4,310mAh), so it's only natural to assume that the charging rate will also be higher to maintain the same recharging time. The Nintendo Switch 2's 5,200mAh capacity should translate to about 20Whr, which means this power bank will be able to charge it about 1.5 times.\nThe built-in cable is a popular feature on newer and generally pricier power banks because you no longer have to bring along your own USB Type-C cable. When you're on the go, the USB plug can be clipped onto the power bank to form a handy little lanyard. The cable itself is quite sturdy with a respectable break strength of 44 pounds and the lanyard loop when clipped to the power bank itself has a break strength of 13 pounds.\nFor more options, check out ourfavorite portable power banks for traveling.\nEric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

Right now, bothSonos directandAmazonare offering one of Sonos' best speakers – the Sonos Arc soundbar – for only $599 after a hefty $300 off instant discount. This is the lowest price we've seen for the Sonos Arc and beats out last year's Black Friday deal by $100. In fact, this is currently less expensive than arefurbished Sonos Arc SLwhich isn't even equipped with a microphone for voice assistant functionality.\n\nThe Arc is one of Sonos' flagship products and was the best soundbar in its lineup until the recent release of theArc Ultra, which currently costs $350 more. This is a premium soundbar and it shows. You can't get much better in terms of sound quality from a soundbar, and that's thanks to its chunkier 45\" length. There's enough space in there to contain eleven precisely engineered internal speakers, including two dedicated height channels. It's Dolby Atmos ready and the Sonos Arc can easily be synced with other Sonos speakers and subs to add even more room-filling audio. This modularity is one of the main reasons why Sonos is so popular. It has other nifty features, like an ambient light sensor, HDMI eARC, capacitive touch controls, WiFi, and more.

    "full_text": "Editor’s note: This interview was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior toNintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States due to the potential impact of tariffs. Parts of this interview were edited for clarity.\n\nNintendo has finally pulled back the curtain onNintendo Switch 2, revealing the company's vision for its next-generation console and its games. Butovershadowing dicussion around what the Switch 2 is capable of, the new gameplay mechanics inMario Kart World, and OG Switch games that will find a new lease of life on Switch 2, isa backlash to Nintendo's pricing strategy.\nWe sat down with Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience Bill Trinen to talk about the big first-party reveals like Mario Kart World andDonkey Kong Bananza, the strategy behindpricing Switch 2 at $450andMario Kart at $80, the decision to releaseNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour as a paid digital productrather than a pack-in game, his excitement forMetroid Prime 4: Beyond's mouse controlsandMasahiro Sakurai's return to the Kirby franchise, and more. Plus, does Bill know what Switch 2 cartridges taste like? Read our full interview below to find out.\nIGN:Congrats on finally unveiling Nintendo Switch 2. How does it feel to finally have it out there?\nBill Trinen:Well, it's just exciting to be able to get all the details out there. For us, the most important thing is that we really want people to recognize and understand that Nintendo Switch 2 is the true successor to Nintendo Switch, takes what you love about Nintendo Switch, and then builds on it with a whole lot of new features and new capabilities and new games that take advantage of those. And really takes what has evolved gaming with Nintendo into something that's a lot more social through things likeGameChat, which takes what was the anytime, anywhere play of Nintendo Switch and makes it more all together, anytime, anywhere.\nIGN:So you just mentioned GameChat, that was a huge part of your presentation yesterday. Why was now the time to finally introduce Nintendo voice chat, which is something that people have wanted on your consoles for a really long time?\nTrinen:Well, I would say we've always looked at it from the perspective of, 'what is Nintendo's real strength and what are Nintendo's real values?' And for us, the most important thing is putting smiles on people's faces and doing it in a way that people can see and experience the smiles that they have with the people that are most important to them.\nAnd certainly there have been other game systems with chat and things like that up until now, but what we wanted to do was to take something that could finally replicate that same room, couch multiplayer, couch co-op experience and joy, and bring that into an online space. And so for us, GameChat is why it's so important is the combination of being able to see their faces, being able to see what they're doing from a gameplay perspective and being able to feel like you've finally got a virtual space where you can have those same experiences that you might have in your living room. So that's why with the power of, I would say Switch 2, being able to finally execute that has been a big focus for us.\nIGN:Cool. And we always knew if you did voice chat, it would be in the most Nintendo way, and just with the camera and the mic on the unit in the dock and you say, 'oh, don't worry the background noise won't get in.' It was a cool presentation.\nTrinen:Good. And that's the nice thing is with the built-in microphone, it's like, yeah, you can just voice chat if you want and you can do that portably as well.\nIGN:Well, let's talk about Donkey Kong Bananza. I love the title by the way, it's perfect. Although last night when I was scrambling to typemy preview, it autocorrected to 'Bonanza' every time, and I was like, 'I’ve got to add this to my dictionary.' But I love the name and it's so exciting to see DK back in the spotlight after so long. And I noticed so many things just getting my hands on the controller for the first time. So when you guys got this game in at Nintendo of America, what stuck out to you the most? What was your favorite part about working on it from a localization perspective or anything else?\nTrinen:Well, so I'll start with a really terrible joke, which is I like to call this the most groundbreaking game in video game history.\nIGN:[Laughs] I used that in my preview today. I said, 'you have to break all the ground you can because you might make a groundbreaking discovery.'\nTrinen:[Laughs] That's right. So for us, the number one thing that I think is probably just the most satisfying about this game is just DK the character. He's back, he's back in a big way. And DK is a character within the pantheon of Nintendo characters who has always been a bit on the more powerful side, wild at times, silly.\nAnd all of that has just been thoroughly baked into this game. And as the character DK, you're able to use the power of his punches and you might attack an enemy in the environment, and that enemy goes flying and hits a wall and the wall crumbles and you see something there, and that then entices you to go in and start digging through the terrain to see what else you can find back there. And it just creates this incredibly rewarding cycle of destruction and discovery that is woven all throughout the game.\nIGN:The discovery via destruction was a really cool cornerstone of this game from my time with it. I thought that was just really great. And the second that I started playing it, I just felt the DNA ofSuper Mario Odysseyand Mr. [Yoshiaki] Koizumi's team all over this in so many ways. Are they the ones that are working on this?\nTrinen:It's a very good question. You'll have to stay tuned. We always like to start by showcasing the game and getting people focused on the gameplay, but we'll have some information to share about the developer in due time.\nIGN:Okay. Can you tell me, is this internally developed? Because there hasn't been an internal Donkey Kong game since I believe Jungle Beat was the last one?\nTrinen:Jungle Beat was the last one.\nIGN:You had the NST (Nintendo Software Technology) do the Mario vs. Donkey Kongs, but...\nTrinen:NST has done the Mario vs. Donkey Kong games, but this is going to be a fun one.\nIGN:So nothing more on that?\nTrinen:Nothing more on that yet.\nIGN:Okay. I had to try. Let's talk about Mario Kart World, because there's so much great stuff in there, but I thinkthe cow is what's stealing everybody's heart. Did you expect that reaction? There's Akira memes about the cow, it's hilarious out there. Did you know the cow was going to be a big star?\nTrinen:I would say perhaps not as big as the cow has become. Internally, certainly the very first moment that we saw the cow, everybody wanted to play as Cow.\nIGN:When we were playing Knockout Tour yesterday, there were just like seven cows on the track.\nTrinen:Well, that's the other thing that I just love about Mario Kart World is with the interconnected world of tracks, as I'm driving, you'll start something like Knockout Tour and you'll be driving across the continent. And what used to be the Mario Kart model was there's discrete tracks and you race on a discrete track and then you choose a different track and you race on a different discrete track.\nAnd now what I find is I'm driving through, I'm starting in a new track and driving across the terrain and, 'Oh, I just happened to pass through Moo Moo Meadows and now I'm onto the next thing.' And it's just like for somebody that's grown up playing Mario Kart for so many years, just to be able to have that experience and piece it all together mentally into this big massive continent of racing has been a whole lot of fun for me.\nIGN:It feels like a theme park of Mario Kart history, and I'm driving yesterday and going through all the different segments and then all of a sudden, 'Oh, I'm in the geyser tunnel from Dino Dino Jungle from Double Dash.' But I'm wondering, so right now it seems like the races, you start at one track and end up at another, and then the final lap is one loop around that final circuit you end up at. Not in the Knockout Tour, that's different, but is there a time trial or versus race mode that’s a way to just do three laps at this track? Or are you always driving interconnected between them when you're racing?\nTrinen:You will have abilities to drive three laps on certain tracks. Obviously we've got a Nintendo Direct dedicated to Mario Kart World coming. I think you'll see a lot more on the game there, and I think a lot more that will hopefully surprise you and make you really feel like, 'Wow, there's a lot to this game.'\nIGN:That will be really good to see. Because right now it looks great, it plays great, but I think the talk of the town is the price tag. This is an $80 game from Nintendo in the United States and $50 if you buy the Nintendo Switch 2 bundle. But I saw somewhere on your website that that bundle is only available for a limited time while supplies last. Can you just talk about the strategy behind pricing Mario Kart World this way?\nTrinen:Well, I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value? Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, but I did read your article this morning and I think you had mentioned that you didn’t find a lot to discover when roaming around. So I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out about that.\nBut honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.\nIGN:Okay. And to just stay on pricing for a little bit here.I'm looking at the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of games and some games are $70, some are $80. That's what it's looking like right now. And some are cheaper than that too. I don't think we know the U.S. price for the Welcome Tour yet, but I think we saw the Japanese price is around $10.\nTrinen:Yeah, the U.S. price is $9.99 for the Welcome Tour.\nIGN:$9.99. Okay, digital only.\nTrinen:Yes.\nIGN:I'm just wondering about the strategy behind pricing these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions at the combination of the Switch 1 retail price, usually $59.99, and then whatever that upgrade path is, like $10 for Breath of the Wild, making that a $70 game, or Tears of the Kingdom is an $80 game because it's $70 plus the $10 upgrade path. Can you just walk me through the strategy behind not offering any sort of discount for newcomers on Switch 2 and saying, 'Tears of the Kingdom is $80 now just like Mario Kart is?'\nTrinen:Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?' What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you're looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that's the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game.\nFor somebody who has bought Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the Zelda upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership. So there's no additional charge for those. But I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that.\nIGN:Okay, thanks. And then the pricing for the console itself, too. A lot of people are talking about it — $450 in the United States, and we know there are definitely global economic factors at play. Can you share anything behind the strategy for pricing of the console? Was this something that was up to the wire where you didn't know what it was going to cost until recently? Can you share any insight?\nTrinen:Can't really share insight into any of that. Obviously the cost of everything goes up over time, and I personally would love if the cost of things didn't go up over time. But I think any time you're building a new system that's got new features and new tech, there's costs associated with that. So again, we look at what is the experience on Nintendo Switch? What's the experience on Nintendo Switch 2? What are the new features that it offers? And certainly there's the cost of goods and things that factor into that, but we try to find the right appropriate price for a product based on that.\nIGN:Last question on price, I promise. I played Welcome Tour on the show floor and I walked away and thought, 'this is a perfect pack-in game.' It shows what the console is, it shows HDR, it shows these new technologies Nintendo is embracing — in some cases for the first time — and I feel like it's a great showcase for the console. Was there ever any talk of making this a pack-in game, and why did you make the decision to price it as a separate digital product?\nTrinen:It's an interesting product. We're actually getting ready today, we're going to be doing someNintendo Treehouse Live segmentsand covering a lot of games in detail. That's one of them. And I think people will be able to see through Treehouse Live probably a little bit more maybe than you were able to see on the show floor. It's a pretty robust piece of software. There's a lot of great detail in there.\nFor some people, I think there are people who are particularly interested in the tech and the specs of the system and things like that, for them I think it's going to be a great product. It's really for people that want more information about the system rather than necessarily a quick intro to everything it does. And for that reason and just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, 'Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you're getting out of the product.'\nIGN:Okay. I want to talk about some of the features of the Joy-Con 2 now because I was really impressed with the mouse functionality. I thought that it worked really, really well in something like Metroid Prime 4. I can see that being the preferred way for a lot of people to play that game. So what are your expectations for mouse controls? Are you hoping that third-party developers make great use of them? Do you think it can bring new types of games? Just talk to me about your feelings about the mouse.\nTrinen:Well, personally, I'm really excited about the mouse control. I don't know what your experience with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was, the way that to me is probably my favorite way to play is I like to play split Joy-Con. I just like the freedom of having my hands not locked onto a controller like that. So I often like to play split Joy-Con and having the freedom to just seamlessly drop the mouse down for combat and then pick it back up for split Joy-Con, to me is something, number one, you can't do with any other console, you can't do on PC.\nAnd it makes for a really great experience for the Prime series, particularly because the Prime series is the creator of the first-person adventure genre. And so in a series where you're doing a lot of exploration that's got some combat mixed in with it, that freedom feels right. Because for me, I feel like if I'm doing a lot of exploration, I want to be split Joy-Con. That flexibility to me is amazing.\nI think the other thing that probably I'm hoping people are catching onto is that, yes, the Joy-Con 2 introduced mouse control, but they introduce mouse control in conjunction with the other technology within the Joy-Con. So whereas with a PC mouse, you're moving up and down and side to side and whatnot, with the Joy-Con, you've got the added ability to apply things like the angle that you're twisting the Joy-Con at, and having that also impact the play control with the mouse.\nOr you've got two Joy-Con that have mouse control each, and that means two things. It means either you can have immediate two-player mouse control gameplay right out of the box with the Nintendo Switch 2, or it means, as we see withDrag x Drive, that you can do things with dual Joy-Con control, which hasn't been done before. And so my hope is really threefold. One, is that our own development teams continue to experiment with what they can do with the mouse to create creative new ways to use it.\nI hope that we start to see third-parties that are then looking at opportunities with things like dual mouse control or combination of mouse plus motion control to evolve their gameplay. But I also do hope that when you look at PC developers, for example, if they want to bring a PC-based game to console, they have to spend a lot of time revamping the control scheme and adapting it to button controls. And so having the freedom of mouse control with the Joy-Con hopefully makes PC developers a lot more eager to want to bring their games to Nintendo Switch 2.\nIGN:Well, my social team really wants to know. We don't have Switch 2 cartridges here. Do they taste like Switch 1 cartridges?\nTrinen:[Laughs] I don't know yet.\nIGN:You haven't done a taste test?\nTrinen:I have not done a taste test. I keep hoping for pistachio flavor, but that's not happening.\nIGN:[Laughs] I don't think that would turn away the kids. Okay, cool. Well, my last question here is that Kirby Air Riders was a huge surprise at the Nintendo Direct yesterday. And to see that is this secret project thatMr. [Masahiro] Sakurai teased earlier this year after wrapping up his YouTube series. Cool to see him come back to work with you guys again. Can you share any details further than that teaser we got in the Direct?\nTrinen:Well, I believe Mr. Sakurai has said that there will not be any additional information on the game for quite a while. The team's working very hard on it. But for me, this was probably one of the most exciting announcements for a couple of reasons.\nOne, I'm always excited to see what Sakurai-san is working on. Two, he created the Kirby character and the Kirby franchise. And so it's great to see him come back to lead and direct a Kirby game again for the first time in a couple of decades. But I think more importantly, I've always felt that Kirby Air Ride on GameCube was a game that was ahead of its time and maybe not fully understood at the time that it came out.\nAnd so I'm just really excited because there's a core group of people that played that game on GameCube that love it to death. And number one, I'm just happy because for them, this is such a big announcement and it's so good to see their excitement. But at the same time, I think that with where we are in the game industry today, I think we've got a real opportunity to introduce a much bigger audience to Kirby Air Riders. And I think people will finally really begin to appreciate just what I think is the genius of Masahiro Sakurai and what he created with that game.\nIGN:Well, I'm in that core group. It's like one of my big childhood games. I love Kirby Air Ride, City Trial Free Roam. That's all I was doing, so I'm very excited. But thanks so much, Bill. We're super excited for June 5 and everything else that's coming on the way.\nTrinen:Great. Thank you.\nLogan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager & Playlist Editor. The Legend of Zelda is his favorite video game franchise of all time, and he is patiently awaiting the day Nintendo announces a brand new F-Zero. You can find him on Bluesky @LoganJPlant."

    "full_text": "SXSW's The Future of World-building at Disney Panel was filled with exciting details and teases of the future of Disney Parks, including how The Mandalorian and Grogu will be joining a new mission aboard Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run, that Imagineers will need to create a new type of ride vehicle with emotion for Magic Kingdom's Cars ride, and a tease of what the load area and lift off will look like for the new Monsters, Inc. attraction.\n\nDisney Experiences Chairman Josh D'Amaro and Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman led the festivities and discussed what their teams are working on and how beneficial it is when they collaborate for exciting new experiences at Disney Parks.\nThere was a ton discussed, and we've gathered all the biggest announcements and reveals below!\nWhile we knewThe Mandalorian and Grogu would be part of a new story on Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Runat Walt Disney World and Disneyland, Disney confirmedthe new experience would debut alongside The Mandalorian & Grogu movie on May 22, 2026.\nThe Mandalorian creator Jon Favreau and Imagineers Leslie Evans and Asa Kalama shared a bit more about the upcoming new story and revealed some concept art of locations that should excite fans of that galaxy far, far away. The images, which you can see below, include a Jawa's Sandcrawler on Tatooine, the Millennium Falcon and Mando's Razor Crest flying toward Cloud City on Bespin, and even a tease of visit to the wreckage of the second Death Star above Endor.\nImagineers captured scenes for this new story from the set of The Mandalorian & Grogu, meaning it should feelveryauthentic when it goes live.\nIn addition, it was also revealed that the wonderful BDX droids that have been seen at Disneyland will soon be making their way to Walt Disney World, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris. There will even be a new variant as an Anzellan (like Babu Frik!) named Otto will sometimes appear on a BDX that needs a little tune up.\nOh, and if that wasn't enough BDX goodness for you, the team shared these droids will be making an appearance in The Mandalorian & Grogu.\nMonsters, Inc. Land is coming soon to Disney World's Hollywood Studiosand it will include an exciting new themed roller coaster that will be Disney Park's first-ever suspended coaster andits first with a vertical lift.\nThis new attraction aims to give guests the dream-come-true moment of soaring through Monsters, Inc.'s door vault and Disney shared a first look at the load area and how it should set the tone very well of what's to come.\nWe still have much to learn about this new attraction and the land it will live in, but this is an exciting tease nonetheless.\nPixar Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter and Imagineer Michael Hundgen sharednew details about the upcoming Cars attractionthat will be part ofthe new Cars-themed landthat is currently in development at Magic Kingdom.\n“Our primary goal is creating an emotional experience for our guests,” Hundgen said. “For thisCarsattraction, we need to invent a new type of ride vehicle. No one builds these in a factory because it has to do so much more than just carrying you from one place to another. We have to create a car that conveys a feeling when you ride in it.”\nThe team needed some real-world data to help in their research so they went to the Arizona desert to ride in an off-road vehicle and take off over rocky terrain. This new ride doesn't take place in Radiator Springs, but instead it will be a thrilling rally race through the mountains, so they want it to feel just right.\nFrom there, they worked with a motocross company to build a dirt track of their own to race around and used that to develop what will eventually be the ride vehicle.\n\"We’re using a customized production vehicle,” Hundgen continued. “It has sensors all over it, and we’re taking it for test drives on our dirt track to gather data on how the vehicle responds to different terrain. This is where we turn that feeling we want into real-world engineering.\"\nThese vehicles will also get some Disney and Pixar magic thrown in as each car will have its own personality, name, and number.\nDisneyland's Avengers Campus is getting two new attractions, including one calledAvengers Infinity Defensewhere guests will team up with members of the Avengers to take on King Thanos across multiple worlds. However, the second one was the star of Disney's SXSW panel asRobert Downey Jr. himself stopped by to share new details about it.\nIt's been previously revealed thatDowney Jr. would be returning as Tony Stark for Avengers Campus' Stark Flight Lab,an attraction that will take guests into Tony's workshop and allow them to experience some of the new tech he's been working on.\nDowney Jr. said these new experiences are \"the living embodiment of the Stark Enterprises mission statement.\"\n“The curiosity, the passion, the inventiveness, the occasional flair for the dramatic, most of all a drive to put something good out into the world to make life better, at the minimum more fun by a mile, ” Downey continued. “It’s the privilege of a lifetime to be invited to participate.”\nAs for the ride itself, guests will sit in \"gyro-kinetic pods\" and will eventually be grabbed by a giant robot arm who will help them make \"several high-speed maneuvers inspired by Iron Man and some other Avengers.\"\n\"Transferring from a track to a robot arm and then back again – nothing like this has ever been done before in a theme park, and we’re so excited about it,” Chief Creative Officer for Walt Disney Imagineering Bruce Vaughn explained. “Usually, we hide all the tech behind the scenes so you can focus on the story. Here, the tech IS the story, so we’re putting it front and center.”\nOne of they ways Imagineering is making the tech the star of this attraction is the focus on that robotic arm, which actually takes heavy inspiration from Tony Stark's little robotic friend, DUM-E. The team enlisted the help of dancers and motion capture to help make these robots feel as real as possible.\nFor more from the world of Disney, check outour 75th Anniversary Retrospective for Cinderella,how Disneyland will be celebrating its 70th anniversary,andeverything else announced at D23's big Disney Experiences Showcase.\nHave a tip for us?

    "full_text": "Apple's newest AirPods are all on sale as part of the bigAmazon Spring Salethat starts today. Starting with the highest end model, the second generationApple AirPods Prowireless noise-canceling earbuds is $169.99 shipped (normally $240). The next step down, theApple AirPods 4 with ANC(active noise cancelation) is down to $149.99 (normally $179). Finally, the value-packedAirPods 4 without ANCdrops to $99.99 (normally $129). iPhone users, these are without a doubt the best earbuds to pair with your smartphone.\n\nThe AirPods Pro is the best-sounding \"truly wireless\" earbuds for iPhone users thanks to its passively isolating in-ear design combined with excellent active noise cancelation, low-distortion driver and amp, and the Apple H2 chip. It also has useful features like Adaptive Transparency Mode, which lets you better hear your surroundings without removing your earbuds, and Conversation Mode, which automatically enhances the voices of people you're talking to. The second generation AirPods Pro replaces the Lightning port with a more universal USB Type-C port so you don't have to mix and match cables, and also includes a MagSafe charging case as standard.\nThe Apple AirPods 4 was released on September, 2024 in two variants: both models are mostly identical with the exception of the noise canceling functionality on the more expensive one. The AirPods 4 features several updates over the AirPods 3 which brings it in-line with modern day standards. These improvements include the newer Apple H2 chip (vs H1), Bluetooth 5.3 support (vs Bluetooth 5.0), better IP54 resistance rating which now protects against dust intrustion (vs IPX4), USB Type-C (vs Lightning), and replacement of the skin detect sensor with a more reliable optical in-ear sensor.\nThe AirPods Pro is a superior earbud, which is why it retails for $70 more than the AirPods 4 ANC. Both feature active noise cancelation, but the AirPods Pro produces better sound quality and more effective noise canceling because of its design. The AirPods 4 ANC is an open-ear style earbud with non-adjustable tips. They're designed to sit right outside of the ear which – while comfortable – means you get plenty of sound leakage and ambient noise intrusion.\nOn the other hand, the AirPods Pro is an in-ear style of earbud that sits right inside your ear canal, sealing the passage and passively isolating it from the ambient air. Adjustable tips are included to accomodate different sized ears and ensure you get that proper sealing fit, which is very important to squeeze out the best performance. At this price, the only compelling reason to still go for the AirPods 4 ANC is if you don't like the intrusive nature of in-ear style earbuds in general.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "full_text": "Don't miss out on one of the best deals to happen during theAmazon Spring Sale. Right now you can pick up the venerableSony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphonesfor only $249.99 shipped. That's $80 less than Black Friday and currently the same price as its XM4 predecssor. It's the lowest price we've ever seen for this model. The WH-1000XM5 is considered by many to be thebest noise cancelling headphonesunder $400.\n\nSony WH1000XM5 Reviewby Kevin Lee\n\"The Sony WH-1000XM5 is the big upgrade we’ve been waiting for from Sony’s flagship wireless headphones. The new design and AI makes the noise-canceling stronger while the ambient listening mode is splendidly natural. Audio quality is impeccable too – whether you want to listen to intricate classical music or a rocking action movie, these headphones can do it all.\"\nThe prior generation Sony XM4 was already an outstanding headphone, but the XM5 features key improvements in noise cancellation and comfort. The XM5 has been fitted with a second processor and double the microphone count dedicated to filtering out ambient noise. The earcups have also been redesigned so that they fit more snugly on the ear, thus creating a better seal and as a result, more effective passive noise isolation. The noise cancelling is noticeably better than the XM4 and pretty much any other noise cancelling headset in its price range.\nThe Sony WH-1000XM5 has also been updated with a noticeably sleeker redesign with a different style of headband adjustment. The band is wider than before for better weight distribution and the earcup padding is now made of a luxurious synthetic leather material that's softer and more comfortable. You can easily wear these headphones for hours. One small drawback, however, is that the XM5 can no longer be folded inward, only swivelled, so it's less compact.\nThe Sony WH-1000XM5 retains the XM4's excellent battery life at over 30 hours on a single charge even with ANC activated. The XM5 also supports fast charging over USB Type-C.\nBest of all, at this price, the XM5 is considerably less expensive than its competitors like theBose QuietComfort Ultraand theAirPods Max. If you're already in the market for a premium noise cancelling headphone, you should jump on this deal.\nIf you're looking for audio upgrades, we've seen everythingApple AirPodsto thebest gaming headsetsdiscounted at Amazon.

    "full_text": "Nintendo has confirmed that those sleek new Switch 2 game cards won’t always carry an actual game and will, instead, sometimes simply contain a key for a game download.\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. company detailed how it will update its approach to physical game cartridges in acustomer support postpublished shortly after this morning’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. It explains that, when the Switch 2arrives this June, you’ll be able to carry on purchasing physical Switch games just as you’ve done for the last eight years, but there are a few things to keep in mind.\nThe post in question focuses on game-key cards: physical cards that only contain a key to download your chosen game. That means there’s no actual game data on the card you insert into your Switch 2, so you’ll need to download it once the card is inserted. Every game-key card case will be appropriately labeled on the lower portion of the front of the box, so if you’re concerned about what exactly you’re purchasing, you should have a heads-up right away.\nNews that Nintendo will utilize these game-key cards for Switch 2 has already taken hold of physical gaming fans who prefer the simplicity of plug-in-play without the need for lengthy download periods and an internet connection to get set up. The concern is that these are little more than fancy key holders that will soon replace all standard cartridges, but there are few reasons to believe this is actually the case for now.\nMany have already taken to social media to point out that, while some early looks at Switch 2 box art, including covers for games likeStreet Fighter 6and theBravely Default remaster, do indeed feature that game-key card disclaimer, others, such asMario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananza, do not.\nIt appears the game-key card approach will likely be reserved for a few especially hefty games that might benefit from the key strategy, such as something like Hogwarts Legacy or Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Even then, developer CD Projekt Red hasalready confirmed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will ship with a game cardthat comes in at a whopping 64 GB on the Switch 2’s launch day.\nAdditionally, as explained during the Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo seems pretty proud ofthe new tech its upgraded red game cards support. They’re said to come with faster data reading speeds than what was seen with the original hybrid console from 2017, a fact the company wouldn’t need to point out if all of its cartridges were simple key containers. Let's not forget that Nintendo has bent the definition of what a game card offers before, with some notable original Switch examples beingLA NoireandNBA 2K18, which both required additional downloads out of the box.\nIt’s far too soon to tell just how many Switch 2 games will rely on game-key cards, but we know all will be revealed as launch draws closer. For now, the Nintendo Switch 2 is primed to click into action come June 5, 2025. For everything revealed during today’s all-encompassing Direct, clickhere.

    "full_text": "If you're in the process of building out a new gaming PC and you're looking for the best gaming processor, this is it. Right now, the recently releasedAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DAM5 desktop processor is back in stock on Amazon and Best Buy at its retail price of $479 shipped. This is the official launch price with zero markup, and it's not bundled with anything you don't want or need. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming processor currently on the market (across both AMD and Intel) and a better choice for gamers than the more expensiveIntel Core Ultra 9 285K.\n\nAMD's X3D series processors are optimized for gaming. In that respect, they bench better than even the most expensive of AMD's standard lineup of CPUs thanks to AMD's 3D V-Cache technology. Although perfectly capable of handling multitasking, rendering, and creation, the limited number of cores means they aren't the ideal processors for those tasks. At its retail price of $479, the 9800X3D is $110 cheaper than theIntel Core Ultra 9 285K($589) and $170 cheaper than theAMD Ryzen 9 9950X, even though it outperforms both of them in gaming. Unless you're a staunch Intel fan, or you're still on AM4 and don't want to upgrade all of your components, the 9800X3D is the obvious choice for your next gaming rig.\n\"The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is extremely powerful in games, which makes it easier to recommend than other recent processors like the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K or Ryzen 9 9900X. Especially if you’re building a rig with a powerful graphics card, the 9800X3D is going to be the best way to get the most performance out of whichever GPU you pair it with.\"\nIf you decided to hold off on Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs to see if AMD's new offerings were up to snuff, then you made the right choice. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards are the new mid-range champions of this generation. Both cards offer phenomenal performance while undercutting their Nvidia competition in price. The Radeon RX 9070 starts at $550 and the 9070 XT starts at $600 (although it turns out that manufacturers are hiking the price again).

    "full_text": "If you're looking for an affordable power bank that will fast charge your Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or Apple iPhone 16, then check out today's deal. Amazon has theIniu 10,000mAh Power Bankwith up to 45W of Power Delivery over USB Type-C for only $11.25 after you redeem the 50% off coupon on the product page. Iniu power banks have solid reviews and are less expensive than equivalent Anker models.\n\nThis Iniu power bank holds a 10,000mAh, or 37Whr battery capacity. If you factor in 80% power efficiency, here are the approximate number of times you can fully recharge each gaming handheld:\nThe Iniu power bank has three output ports: one built-in 45W USB Type-C cable, one 45W USB Type-C port, and one USB Type-A port. The 45W of Power Delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch (18W) and Steam Deck (40W) at their fastest rate. This power bank is also a solid choice for charging your Apple iPhone 16, sinceChargerLAB has shown that the maximum charging rate caps at about 30W, even for the Pro Max model.\nWe don't yet know what the maximum charging rate for theNintendo Switch 2will be, but we are hoping that it will be greater than the 18W maximum of the original Switch.We do know that the battery capacity is higher(5,220mAh vs 4,310mAh), so it's only natural to assume that the charging rate will also be higher to maintain the same recharging time. The Nintendo Switch 2's 5,200mAh capacity should translate to about 20Whr, which means this power bank will be able to charge it about 1.5 times.\nThe built-in cable is a popular feature on newer and generally pricier power banks because you no longer have to bring along your own USB Type-C cable. When you're on the go, the USB plug can be clipped onto the power bank to form a handy little lanyard. The cable itself is quite sturdy with a respectable break strength of 44 pounds and the lanyard loop when clipped to the power bank itself has a break strength of 13 pounds.\nFor more options, check out ourfavorite portable power banks for traveling.\nEric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/samsung-s90d-4k-oled-smart-tv-deal-2025",
    "full_text": "A Black Friday deal on one of the best OLED TVs is back. Starting today,AmazonandSamsungare offering the 2024 65\" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV for only $1,399.99 shipped after $1,300 in instant savings. This is anexcellent TV to pair up with your PlayStation 5or Xbox Series X. This TV is considered to as good as or better than the popular LG C4 OLED TV. According toRTINGS, the Samsung S90D is a brighter TV with a wider color gamut, better color volume, wider viewing angle, and better HDR gradient handling.\n\nThe Samsung S90D is the current generation 2024 model. A new \"S90F\" model was announced during CES 2025, but it has yet to be released. This TV is equipped with Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times.\nOLED technology aside, the Samsung S90D also has all the features you'd want in agaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming console. The S90D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to the recently releasedPlaystation 5 Proconsole since it can drive more games in quality mode (native 4K @ 120fps) than the standard PS5, which often needs to be set to performance mode (upscaled 4K).\nIf you're looking for a smaller size, the 42\", 48\", and 55\" models are also on sale. The 42\" model is ideal for PC monitor use. At that screen size, the 4K resolution equates to a respectable 104ppi pixel density and supports chroma 4:4:4 subsampling for clear, legible text. The HDMI 2.1 input supports refresh rates of up to 144Hz over 4K resolution.\nFor this week only, Best Buy is offering the 77\" Samsung S84D 4K OLED smart TV for $1,499.99. That's only $150 more than the 65\" S90D model for a 40% larger screen size. The S84D is Best Buy's exclusive model that's identical to the S85D but with slightly better speakers (30W vs 20W). Compared to the S90D, the S84D is a step down in image quality since it doesn't utilize quantum dot technology and the refresh rate is limited to 120Hz instead of 144Hz. However, it's still an outstanding TV compared to other TVs on the market and an excellent value at this price.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "full_text": "You don't have to wait for the new 2025 LG TVs to drop to score a great deal on an older generation model. Right now, you can pick up a 202365\" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TVfor just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday. The LG Evo C-series of TVs have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVs, especially for 4K HDR movies and gaming.\n\nThe LG Evo C3 is a 2023 model, just one year behind the 2024 LG Evo C4. So what are the differences? Aside from the $650 price difference, not much. The most important trait -- picture quality -- is more or less identical. Where the C4 improves on the C3 are an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate.\nOLED TVs are considered the best TVs you can buy right now. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, they offer better image quality, deeper blacks, better contrast ratio, wider color gamut, and super fast response times. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV are easily the best type of TV for viewing 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations.\nThe LG C3 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel and all four HDMI 2.1 ports for running 4K at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. It also supports variable refresh rate (VRR), auto low latency mode (ALLM), and DTS audio, which is good for people who still watch Blu-ray discs. The C3 is also much easier to set up than its predecessors; the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that drops the weight to a mere 36 pounds.\nThe LG Evo C-series TV is ourfavorite high-end 4K TV of 2025because of the brilliance of its OLED display along with a host of quality features that don't quite push it to the point of an excessively high price. This model brings better contrast and clarity than the previous year's already luminous LG C2. It’s a sight to behold, especially when you add in the deep blacks and well-balanced colors on the crisp 4K screen.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/best-apple-airpods-pro-deal-2025-3",
    "full_text": "Apple's newest AirPods are all on sale as part of the bigAmazon Spring Salethat starts today. Starting with the highest end model, the second generationApple AirPods Prowireless noise-canceling earbuds is $169.99 shipped (normally $240). The next step down, theApple AirPods 4 with ANC(active noise cancelation) is down to $149.99 (normally $179). Finally, the value-packedAirPods 4 without ANCdrops to $99.99 (normally $129). iPhone users, these are without a doubt the best earbuds to pair with your smartphone.\n\nThe AirPods Pro is the best-sounding \"truly wireless\" earbuds for iPhone users thanks to its passively isolating in-ear design combined with excellent active noise cancelation, low-distortion driver and amp, and the Apple H2 chip. It also has useful features like Adaptive Transparency Mode, which lets you better hear your surroundings without removing your earbuds, and Conversation Mode, which automatically enhances the voices of people you're talking to. The second generation AirPods Pro replaces the Lightning port with a more universal USB Type-C port so you don't have to mix and match cables, and also includes a MagSafe charging case as standard.\nThe Apple AirPods 4 was released on September, 2024 in two variants: both models are mostly identical with the exception of the noise canceling functionality on the more expensive one. The AirPods 4 features several updates over the AirPods 3 which brings it in-line with modern day standards. These improvements include the newer Apple H2 chip (vs H1), Bluetooth 5.3 support (vs Bluetooth 5.0), better IP54 resistance rating which now protects against dust intrustion (vs IPX4), USB Type-C (vs Lightning), and replacement of the skin detect sensor with a more reliable optical in-ear sensor.\nThe AirPods Pro is a superior earbud, which is why it retails for $70 more than the AirPods 4 ANC. Both feature active noise cancelation, but the AirPods Pro produces better sound quality and more effective noise canceling because of its design. The AirPods 4 ANC is an open-ear style earbud with non-adjustable tips. They're designed to sit right outside of the ear which – while comfortable – means you get plenty of sound leakage and ambient noise intrusion.\nOn the other hand, the AirPods Pro is an in-ear style of earbud that sits right inside your ear canal, sealing the passage and passively isolating it from the ambient air. Adjustable tips are included to accomodate different sized ears and ensure you get that proper sealing fit, which is very important to squeeze out the best performance. At this price, the only compelling reason to still go for the AirPods 4 ANC is if you don't like the intrusive nature of in-ear style earbuds in general.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

Especially for the 55\" model, you won't find a better TV for under $1,000.\n\nGenerally speaking, OLED TVs are considered the best TVs you can buy right now.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/sk-hynix-p41-platinum-ssd-deal-for-ps5-or-gaming-pc",
    "full_text": "Amazon has recently dropped the price on the2TB SK Hynix P41 PlatinumPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVME solid state drive (SSD) to only $124.99 shipped. The SK Hynix P41 Platinum is one of thefastest PCI-E 4.0 SSDs available, has DRAM cache, and is considerably less expensive than other comparable SSDs like theSamsung 990 Pro($168) and theWD SN850X($154). This is an excellent SSD for either your PlayStation 5 console or gaming PC.\n\nUpdate:Price has dropped again from $129.99 to $124.99.\nSK Hynix might not be as recognizable of a brand as Samsung or Western Digital among consumers, but make no mistake that they are a major player in the flash memory market. SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and one of the world's largest memory chipmakers and semiconductor companies. They supply components for many reputable brands you've probably heard of, like Corsair and G.Skill.\nThe Platinum P41 is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read speeds of 7,000MB/s and write speeds of 6,500MB/s as well as random read speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and write speeds of 1.3 million IOPS. The Platinum P41 also has a dedicated DRAM cache, Most SSDs at this price point lack any DRAM cache and instead rely on HMB, or system memory, to cover the shortfall. In terms of reliability and stability, th Platinum P41 has been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written. It uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips, both of which are manufactured in-house. SK Hynix warranties this SSD with a 5 year warranty.\nThe SK Hynix P41 Platinum makes for a great secondary SSD for your PlayStation 5 console since it performs well above Sony's minimum speed recommendation of 5,600MB/s. It's possible this SSD will run fine without a heatsink, but we like to err on the side of caution and would recommend you install one for peace of mind. Besides, you can get a perfectly adequateslim PS5 heatsink for just $7.\nThe Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.\nLooking for more options?

    "full_text": "Here's an inexpensive alternative to swapping out AA batteries from your Xbox controller all the time. Amazon is offering atwo-pack of aftermarket rechargeable batteries for your Xbox controllerfor a mere $11.69 after you clip both coupons (20% off and 50% off) on the product page. That's just $5.85 per battery pack. As a comparison, the official MicorosoftPlay & Charge Kitwill run you $25, and that is for a single battery pack.\n\nThese rechargeable battery packs from \"6amLifestyle\" are compatible with both thecurrent generation Xbox Series X|S controllersand theolder Xbox One controllers. A nice feature of these battery packs is that they work with the stock USB port on the Xbox controller. Most other rechargeable packs have their own little port elsewhere that you need to use. A quality 10ft USB Type-C cable is included as well as a USB Type-C to Micro USB adapter for the legacy Xbox One controller. The cable is pretty cool because it has a little light that glows red when charging and blue when fully topped off.\n6amLifestyle states that each battery pack can last up to 35 hours of continuous playtime and can charge from empty to full in about three hours. That's pretty similar to the Play & Charge Kit's claim of 30 hours of playtime and four-hour charge time, which makes sense since both packs have the same 1,400mAh capacity. Having two batteries also means you can immediately swap over to another pack when the first one is depleted, thus minimizing your downtime.\nLooking for more Xbox deals?

Taking the PS5 marketing mantra that “play has no limits” more seriously than you’d expect, Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it.\"\nIf you bought a brand new TV over the holidays and you're looking for a good audio solution at an excellent price, then one of the best Black Friday deals is back. Walmart is currently offering theBose Smart Soundbar 550for just $199 with free shipping after a massive $300 off instant discount.

Moderate packing damage observed during inspection.\nThePlayStation Portalhas never been discounted, but at least you can save on a used one.Amazon Resale(a rebranded Amazon Warehouse) currently has Used: Like New condition PS Portals in stock for only $161.37 shipped. It retails for $199 new, so that's a substantial 20% in savings. A Sony warranty may or may not be included, but Amazon Resale items benefit from the same 30-day return policy you get for buying a new item. We expect this item to sell out pretty quickly.\nLenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code \"PLAY5\" in cart.

    "full_text": "Finding a good deal on Apple products is rough, which is why I focused on all of these daily deals today. Finding multiple Apple deals, plus discounts on Zelda and Final Fantasy collectibles? It's my gamer-tech jackpot. Right now, you can save onAirPods Pro 2, grab aMagSafe leather case for just $11.99, and even score afour-pack of AirTags for under $70.\n\nIf you’re in the market forwireless earbuds,power adapters, or anApple Watchband, there are plenty of options at all-time low prices. And you know by now I like to pop in some really cool gaming stuff. How about a full-sizedMaster Sword replicathat plays Zelda music when you swing it and aFinal Fantasy I-VI bundlethat brings the pixel-perfect RPG classics back to life?\nUpgrade your tech, complete your Zelda shrine, or relive Final Fantasy’s golden era, these deals are worth checking out. Some discounts like the iPhone 14 Plus MagSafe case, are downright ridiculous at 80% off. But Apple deals never last long (Tim Cook loves that Apple tax), and limited collectibles definitely sell out fast. If something catches your eye, now’s the time to add to cart before the price jumps back up.\nAliExpress is offering this Arzopa 15\" 1080p USB Type-C portable monitor for only $57 shipped after you apply coupon code \"IFPQHLH\". We've posted deals on this portable monitor in the past, but this is the lowest price we've seen thus far. The marketplace vendor is Arzopa itself so you're getting the full manufacturer's warranty on this brand new, retail packaged item. This monitor is primarily designed to be a secondary display for a laptop, but the S1's 1080p 60Hz panel is a great match for the Nintendo Switch's hardware, since the Switch only supports up to 720p @ 60Hz anyway.\nFor only $22 more, you can upgrade to the higher end Arzopa Z1FC USB portable monitor, now only $79.19 after coupon code \"IFPQHLH\". It's currently $117 on Amazon. The Z1FC's upgrades include a larger display (16.1\" vs 15.6\"), a higher refresh rate (144Hz vs. 60Hz), and better color reproduction (100% sRGB color gamut). This is a better monitor than the S1 to pair with the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally because both gaming handhelds can support refresh rates up to 144Hz.\nApple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.\nBeats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art. The remastered soundtracks, modernized UI, and quality-of-life improvements bring these classics into the modern age while keeping their original charm intact. Each game features iconic character designs by Kazuko Shibuya and a faithful soundtrack rearranged by Nobuo Uematsu. Whether you’re reliving the golden age of RPGs or playing them for the first time, this bundle is the ultimate way to experience Final Fantasy’s roots. The limited-time sale price of $52.49, down from $74.99, makes this an easy win for any RPG fan.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experience Final Fantasy I through VI in glorious HD pixel art.

The limited-time sale price of $52.49, down from $74.99, makes this an easy win for any RPG fan.\nIf you’ve ever dreamed of wielding the Master Sword, this Tamashii Nations replica brings that dream to life. At 41.3 inches, it’s a full-sized, collector-worthy version of Link’s legendary blade. It’s not just for display either thanks to authentic sound effects and vibrations activate when you grip and swing it, making you feel like the true Hero of Hyrule.\nThe hilt features three buttons that play eight iconic songs from Zelda’s history, including themes from Ocarina of Time, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom. The sword comes with a sheath and display stand, so whether you want to show it off or take it into battle (against your furniture), it’s ready. At $200, this highly allocated collectible is bound to sell out fast.\nA genuine Apple leather case for $11.99? That’s not a typo. It’s an 80% discount. Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.\nIf you’re tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.\nWhy buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.\nIf you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.\nStill using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.\nThese aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.\nThese Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.\nLuxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.\nThis isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.\nFor those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says \"powerful Pokémon\" like an angry robot penguin).\nI'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.\nIf somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.\nYour PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).\nIf you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, \"I really need to delete some games,\" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.\nLogitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.\nSamsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room. The Acoustic Lens Subwoofer ensures deep, punchy bass, while Adaptive Sound and Game Mode Pro make sure everything from dialogue to explosions sounds crisp. At $764 off, this is the cheapest we’ve seen it outside of Black Friday.\nLG B4 OLED TVbrings incredible picture quality at a price that doesn’t require selling a kidney. It features Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, an α8 AI Processor that automatically enhances whatever you’re watching, and LG’s latest webOS for easy access to streaming apps and over 300 free LG Channels. Gamers get Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and VRR, plus four HDMI 2.1 ports. At $499.99, this is one of the best deals for an OLED right now.\nSamsung’s S90D OLED TVis a beast, packing AI-powered 4K upscaling, Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for silky smooth gameplay, and Dolby Atmos for immersive sound. Real Depth Enhancer makes everything look more lifelike, and PANTONE validation ensures accurate color reproduction. At $300 off, this is a great price for a high-end 65” OLED TV.\nSony’s WH-CH520 headphonesoffer 50 hours of battery life, customizable sound settings, and a lightweight, comfortable design. Multipoint connection makes switching between devices seamless, and DSEE upscaling improves compressed audio. At just $35.95, these are one of the best budget wireless headphones out there today.\nGoogle’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 bring top-tier noise cancellation, a Tensor A1 chip for AI-powered audio enhancements, and large 11mm drivers for rich bass. Conversation Detection automatically switches to transparency mode when you talk, so you don’t have to take them out. If you need premium wireless earbuds, this is asolid deal for these 9/10 buds.\nEnshrouded is a survival RPG with deep crafting, intense combat, and massive co-op potential. Play solo or team up with up to 16 friends, build custom bases, and fight through a dark, mysterious world. It’s still in early access, but at $23.99, it’s worth jumping in now aswe gave it 8/10.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "title": "Get a Dell or Alienware GeForce RTX 4090 Prebuilt Gaming PC for as Low as $2,850",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-07T22:05:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/dell-alienware-geforce-rtx-4090-gaming-pc-deals",
    "full_text": "The GeForce RTX 4090 is a generation older than the new Blackwell 50 series GPUs, but this doesn't change the fact that it's still one of the most powerful cards out there, eclipsing the GeForceRTX 5080orRTX 4080 Superor the RadeonRX 9070 XTorRX 7900 XTX. Only one GPU performs better - theRTX 5090- and you'll need to use up a lifetime of luck to find one that isn't marked up by hundreds, even thousands of dollars.\n\nBecause the RTX 4090 has been discontinued, it's getting harder to source as well. Fortunately, Dell still sells aAlienware Aurora R16gaming PC configuration that can be equipped with a 4090 GPU. Not only is it one of the few RTX 4090 prebuilts still available - Lenovo and HP no longer carry them - it's also one of the more reasonably priced ones.\nThisAlienware Aurora R16 gaming PCis equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F CPU, GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, 16GB of DDR5-5200MHz RAM, and a 1TB NVMe SSD. The processor can also be upgraded up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K. If you're getting system with a focus on gaming, then the upgrade is unnecessary. Gaming at higher resolutions is almost always GPU bound, and besides, the default Intel Core Ultra 7 265F is a solid processor with a max turbo frequency of 5.3GHz and a total of 20 cores. It's cooled by a robust 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler and the entire system is powered by an 1,000W 80PLUS Platinum power supply.\nDell just dropped the price on this upgraded RTX 4090 model to $3,599.99 after a $400 instant discount. It's $600 more than the base model Alienware 4090 gaming PC, but that's because the processor has been upgraded to a much more powerful Intel Core i9-14900KF CPU. You also get quadruple the RAM and double the storage.\nThe RTX 4090 is themost powerful RTX 40 series GPUon the market. Compared to the new Blackwell cards, only the $2,000 MSRP RTX 5090 is superior in performance. This card will run every game comfortably at 4K resolution; you should be hitting 60+fps even with all settings turned to the max and ray tracing enabled, doubly so if DLSS is supported. The only setting that the 4090 (as well as every other GPU) struggles with is path tracing, but no one really ever turns this on except during benchmark tests or social media flexing. The RTX 5090 might be faster, but for the vast majority of people out there, it's just wasted power since the 4090 already excels at pretty much all things gaming.\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU Reviewby Chris Coke\n\"The RTX 4090 may be huge and expensive, but holy smokes if it doesn’t blow the competition out of the water. That’s a little unfair because it’s currently the only card of this new generation that’s available, so we only have cards from the past few years to compare it to. But until the rest of the pack can catch up, between its impressive hardware specs and its DLSS 3 AI wizardry, even the $1,599 price doesn’t seem unreasonable for the unrivaled frame rates that this card can crank out.\"\nDell is offering anAlienware Aurora R16 gaming PCequipped with the new GeForce RTX 5080 GPU for $2,499.99 shipped. The RTX 5080 is one of three new Blackwell graphics cards that are out (and impossible to find). In ourNvidia GeForce RTX 5080 FE review, Jackie writes that \"If you already have a high-end graphics card from the last couple of years, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 doesn’t make a lot of sense – it just doesn’t have much of a performance lead over the RTX 4080, though the extra frames from DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation do make things look better in games that support it. However, for gamers with an older graphics card who want a significant performance boost, the RTX 5080 absolutely provides – doubly so if you’re comfortable with Nvidia’s AI goodies.\"\nCheck out more of thebest Alienware deals.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "title": "Amazon Drops the 63\" LG C4 4K OLED Smart TV to $1,397: The Best TV for PlayStation 5",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-21T17:35:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/lg-c4-4k-oled-tv-deal-2025",
    "full_text": "LG's most popular current generation OLED TV has been discounted starting today. Right now Amazon has dropped the price of the65\" LG Evo C4 4K OLED TVto $1,396.99. The LG Evo C-series of TVs - including this model - have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVsfor HDR movie watching and current generation console gaming.\n\nThe C4 is the 2024 model in LG's C-series OLED lineup. The LG Evo C5 hasn't yet been released, butit was showcased during CES 2025. At least on paper, the improvements of the C5 seem to be incremental, with no major ground breaking updates that would make you want to hold off until its launch. More importantly, the C5 will probably release at a very high retail price which will take months to get down to a level that's competitive with other TV deals.\nThe C4 uses LG's Evo panel, which offers higher brightness levels than traditional OLED TVs. Compared to a standard LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. Because of these advantages, the Evo OLED TV excels at displaying 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations.\nThe LG C4 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz and all four HDMI ports are 2.1 spec for running games in 4K at up to 120fps on a PS5 or Xbox Series X without any tearing. The C4 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM). The C4 is also easier to install than its predecessors; the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that weighs 36 pounds.\nThe LG Evo C-series TV is ourfavorite high-end 4K TV of 2025because of the brilliance of its OLED display along with a host of quality features that don't quite push it to the point of an excessively high price. This model brings better contrast and clarity than the previous year's already luminous LG C2. It’s a sight to behold, especially when you add in the deep blacks and well-balanced colors on the crisp 4K screen. Once you choose OLED, it's hard to go back to anything else.\nIf you bought a brand new TV over the holidays and you're looking for a good audio solution at an excellent price, then one of the best Black Friday deals is back. Walmart is currently offering theBose Smart Soundbar 550for just $199 with free shipping after a massive $300 off instant discount. At this price, it's certainly one of the best soundbars you can get, especially if you're looking for an affordable soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos.\nIf you don't mind going a generation back, you can pick up a 202365\" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TVfor just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday. The 2024 C4 has minimal incremental upgrades over the 2023 C3, with the most noticeable improvements being an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, support for DTS audio, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate.\nIf you prefer Sony as your TV brand, then Best Buy has some great deals for this week. The Sony Bravia XR A75L 4K OLED smart TVs are on sale right now with the 55\" model priced at $999.99 and the 65\" model for $1,299.99. Although the A75L is an older generation (2023) TV, it's still one of the best TVs out there in terms of image quality and gaming performance. Especially for the 55\" model, you won't find a better TV for under $1,000.\nLooking for more options?

    "title": "Amazon Has Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Prebuilt Gaming PCs Starting at $2200",

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-prebuilt-gaming-pc-deals",
    "full_text": "The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card was released in late February for $749.99, but good luck finding one at that price. As with the rest of the Blackwell lineup, everyone from personal sellers to themanufacturers themselveshave joined in on theprice markup bonanza. Fortunately there's a way to get around these shenanigans, and that is by purchasing a prebuilt gaming PC instead. Amazon is currently offering CyberPowerPC and Skytech RTX 5070 Ti gaming desktops starting at $2,099.99. That's a reasonable price considering the fact that theRTX 5070 Ti has proven to be nearly identical in performance (within 5%) to the RTX 4080 Super.\n\nOf all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and already marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled.

Across my entire test suite, this GPU soared at 4K, coming within striking distance of much more expensive graphics cards, and that’s before taking multi frame generation into account, which will make the RTX 5070 Ti even better at hitting extremely high framerates, albeit with a hit to latency.\"\nAmazon has the best deal right now on an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT prebuilt.

    "full_text": "ThePlayStation Portalhas never been discounted, but at least you can save on a used one.Amazon Resale(a rebranded Amazon Warehouse) currently has Used: Like New condition PS Portals in stock for only $150.23 shipped. It retails for $199 new, so that's a substantial 25% in savings. A Sony warranty may or may not be included, but Amazon Resale items benefit from the same 30-day return policy you get for buying a new item. We expect this item to sell out pretty quickly.\n\nUpdate:Price has dropped to $150.23, the lowest we've seen for a Used: Like New unit.\nMake sure to select the \"Save with Used - Like New\" option (scroll down a bit)\nUsed: Like New Condition\nLooks and functions as if it were new. Moderate packing damage observed during inspection.\nThe PS Portal, Sony's handheld gaming accessory for the PS5 console, looks very much like an extended split-pad DualSense controller with an 8-inch 1080p LCD screen in the middle of it. It turns your PS5 into a gaming handheld by letting you stream games from your console at up to 60fps. The controller mirrors the same features found on the DualSense, including haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and a touchscreen interface that replaces the Dualsense's touchpad. The Portal can stream your games even when you're outside of your home, with the caveat that you have access tovery stable, very fastinternet connection. Keep in mind that the PS Portal is not a standalone device. This is strictly a remote player for the PlayStation 5, so you will need a PS5 to use it.\nUpdate:You no longer need a PS5 to play games on the PS Portal. Now, rather than being limited to simply streaming games from a $500 console to a $200 handheld, Sony has introduced a feature that lets owners stream games directly from its PlayStation Now cloud streaming service. No PS5 required. Portal owners now have the option to either connect the Portal to their PS5 as before, or directly to Sony’s cloud servers. Choose the latter and suddenly you have access to a library of more than 120 games, including Ghost of Tsushima, Resident Evil 3 Remake, The Last of Us Part 1 Remastered, and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.It’s worth noting you must be a subscriber to the highest tier of PlayStation Plus, but $18 a month is much more attractive that splashing out $500 upfront plus an extra $70 a game.\nIt should be said that the PlayStation Portal isn’t the only way to stream your PS5 games over Wi-Fi within your home. You can mimic its functionality by downloading the PS Remote Play app on a mobile device, including other gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck.  That said, it's more complicated to set up and you'll lose out on some of the Dualsense's features.\nPlayStation Portal Reviewby Seth Macy\n\"The PlayStation Portal is the most surprising device I've ever come away from loving after going in loaded with skepticism. It's such a better experience than using your phone with a slap-on controller, and it works so much better than I was anticipating. I really love the freedom it gives me to play my PS5 from anywhere with decent WiFi coverage, especially when the rest of my family was using the TV to (somewhat ironically) play the Switch. Bearing in mind that it’s in no way a stand-alone device and 100% requires a PlayStation 5 to function at all, the biggest things keeping the Portal from being a truly amazing device are its current lack of a way to access WiFi that requires a web browser to log in, and its lack of Bluetooth support for audio. For now, it's a great device that represents the best current solution for PlayStation Remote Play, and if it weren't for those two baffling caveats, I'd call this a must-own device for every PS5 owner who enjoys playing games on handheld – or has to compete for the household TV.\"\nLenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code \"PLAY5\" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-the-new-amd-ryzen-9950x3d-9900x3d-ryzen-7-9800x3d-gaming-cpus-1",
    "full_text": "If you're thinking of jumping on the AMD bandwagon for your next upgrade, now is certainly the right time to do so. Alongside theRyzen 7 9800X3Dwhich debuted earlier this year, AMD has just released its two higher-end Ryzen 9 siblings in the Zen 5 \"X3D\" stack: the9950X3Dis available for $699 and the9900X3Dis available for $599. Collectively, these processors represent thebest gaming chipsacross both Intel and AMD. Pure gamers should go with the 9800X3D and allocate their funds elsewhere; creators with deeper pockets and a penchant for gaming will benefit from the immense performance uplift on the new Ryzen 9 processors thanks to their increased core count and cache.\n\nNote: Processors are going in and out of stock (mostly out of stock, unfortunately).\nCreative professionals who also want the best gaming chip on the market shouldn't think twice; this is the CPU to get. The new 9950X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.7GHz with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 144MB of L2-L3 cache. In terms of gaming, it's only a few percentage points better than than the 9800X3D. However, for productivity use, it easily outperforms the other two Zen 5 X3D chips, and anything offered by Intel for that matter.\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas\n\"The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D might be the most powerful gaming processor on the market right now, but that doesn’t mean it has a de facto lead on every other chip on the market. Most people will have no problem getting by with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which just so happens to be much much more affordable at $479. Instead, the 9950X3D is geared towards gamers that both play games and use creative apps like Photoshop and Premiere, the latter of which sees a 15% performance improvement over the 9800X3D. For a pure gaming PC build, though, you’re probably better off saving that extra $220 for a better graphics card.\"\nAMD's X3D series processors are gaming optimized thanks to AMD's 3D V-Cache technology. However, since all three CPUs have the 3D V-cache loaded onto a single CCD, you get roughly the same gaming performance across all three chips. The minor differences are mostly due to the difference in clock speed. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.2GHz with 8 cores, 16 threads, and 104MB of L2-L3 cache Although perfectly capable of handling multitasking, rendering, and creation, the limited number of cores means they aren't the ideal processors for those tasks. However, this is an absolute monster of a processor for gaming, especially at this price point.\n\"The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is extremely powerful in games, which makes it easier to recommend than other recent processors like the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K or Ryzen 9 9900X. Especially if you’re building a rig with a powerful graphics card, the 9800X3D is going to be the best way to get the most performance out of whichever GPU you pair it with.\"\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D is the processor you'd get if you do creative work and like to game, but you have a budget to adhere to and the 9950X3D crosses that line. The new 9900X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.5GHz with 12 cores, 24 threads, and 140MB of L2-L3 cache. This is the one chip we haven't reviewed yet, but from the specs, it's pretty easy to guess its performance. In terms of productivity tasks and multi-core workloads, it should perform somewhere in between the 9950X3D and 9800X3D. In terms of gaming, we expect it to be a wash compared to the other two.\nIf you decided to hold off onNvidia's Blackwell GPUs to see if AMD's new offeringswere up to snuff, then you made the right choice. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards are the new mid-range champions of this generation. Both cards offer phenomenal performance while undercutting their Nvidia competition in price. The Radeon RX 9070 starts at $550 and the 9070 XT starts at $600 (although it turns out that manufacturers are hiking the price again).

    "full_text": "The GeForce RTX 4090 is a generation older than the new Blackwell 50 series GPUs, but this doesn't change the fact that it's still one of the most powerful cards out there, eclipsing the GeForceRTX 5080orRTX 4080 Superor the RadeonRX 9070 XTorRX 7900 XTX. Only one GPU performs better - theRTX 5090- and you'll need to use up a lifetime of luck to find one that isn't marked up by hundreds, even thousands of dollars.\n\nBecause the RTX 4090 has been discontinued, it's getting harder to source as well. Fortunately, Dell still sells aAlienware Aurora R16gaming PC configuration that can be equipped with a 4090 GPU. Not only is it one of the few RTX 4090 prebuilts still available - Lenovo and HP no longer carry them - it's also one of the more reasonably priced ones.\nThisAlienware Aurora R16 gaming PCis equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F CPU, GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, 16GB of DDR5-5200MHz RAM, and a 1TB NVMe SSD. The processor can also be upgraded up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K. If you're getting system with a focus on gaming, then the upgrade is unnecessary. Gaming at higher resolutions is almost always GPU bound, and besides, the default Intel Core Ultra 7 265F is a solid processor with a max turbo frequency of 5.3GHz and a total of 20 cores. It's cooled by a robust 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler and the entire system is powered by an 1,000W 80PLUS Platinum power supply.\nDell just dropped the price on this upgraded RTX 4090 model to $3,599.99 after a $400 instant discount. It's $600 more than the base model Alienware 4090 gaming PC, but that's because the processor has been upgraded to a much more powerful Intel Core i9-14900KF CPU. You also get quadruple the RAM and double the storage.\nThe RTX 4090 is themost powerful RTX 40 series GPUon the market. Compared to the new Blackwell cards, only the $2,000 MSRP RTX 5090 is superior in performance. This card will run every game comfortably at 4K resolution; you should be hitting 60+fps even with all settings turned to the max and ray tracing enabled, doubly so if DLSS is supported. The only setting that the 4090 (as well as every other GPU) struggles with is path tracing, but no one really ever turns this on except during benchmark tests or social media flexing. The RTX 5090 might be faster, but for the vast majority of people out there, it's just wasted power since the 4090 already excels at pretty much all things gaming.\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU Reviewby Chris Coke\n\"The RTX 4090 may be huge and expensive, but holy smokes if it doesn’t blow the competition out of the water. That’s a little unfair because it’s currently the only card of this new generation that’s available, so we only have cards from the past few years to compare it to. But until the rest of the pack can catch up, between its impressive hardware specs and its DLSS 3 AI wizardry, even the $1,599 price doesn’t seem unreasonable for the unrivaled frame rates that this card can crank out.\"\nDell is offering anAlienware Aurora R16 gaming PCequipped with the new GeForce RTX 5080 GPU for $2,499.99 shipped.

In ourNvidia GeForce RTX 5080 FE review, Jackie writes that \"If you already have a high-end graphics card from the last couple of years, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 doesn’t make a lot of sense – it just doesn’t have much of a performance lead over the RTX 4080, though the extra frames from DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation do make things look better in games that support it.

TheRazer Blade 16andRazer Blade 18can now be ordered directly from Razer.com and will be equipped with the upcoming Intel and Ryzen processors (depending on which display size you get) as well as the anticipated RTX 5000-series mobile GPUs in three variants: RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080, and RTX 5090. Preordering will also get you some bonus accessories depending on the model.\n\nRazer Blade laptops are well known for their impeccable build quality. The chassis is built from a single piece of aluminum and is designed to be exceptionally thin and light for a gaming laptop. In order to get away with the svelte form factor, Razer employs its own proprietary cooling design which incorporates a vacuum sealed, liquid filled, copper vapor chamber to effectively whisk away the heat. Much like Apple MacBook Pros, a lot of engineering goes into a Razer Blade laptop, which is why they command a premium price compared to other mainstream brands.\nThe Razer Blade 18 is an Intel-based system and the base config is equipped with the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, which is a more performance-minded chip compared to the current Core Ultra 9 185H, which focuses on efficiency. The rest of the specs include an 18\" Dual UHD+ 240Hz display (which can natively switch to FHD+ 440Hz), RTX 5070 Ti graphics, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $3,499.99. You can upgrade to either the RTX 5080 or the RTX 5090.\nPreordering the Razer Blade 16 will also get you an X-Ray Razer laptop skin and a USB-C dock.\nThe Razer Blade 16 is a Ryzen system and the base config is equipped with an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU. The rest of the specs include a 16\" 240Hz QHD+ OLED display, RTX 5070 Ti graphics, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $2,999.99. The processor can be upgraded to a Ryzen AI 9 370HX, and the GPU can be upgraded to either the RTX 5080 or  RTX 5090.\nPreordering the Razer Blade 18 will get youan X-Ray Razer laptop skin and RGB laptop stand.\nRazer has listed an expected ship date ofApril 30on the product pages.\nOur benchmarks are in, and it looks like the RTX 5090 is indeed the new king of mobile GPUs, although not by the leaps and bounds we were hoping for. On average, the RTX 5090 is about 5%-10% more powerful than the RTX 4090 that it replaces. However, add in DLSS 4 and the gap widens.\nRTX 5090 Mobile Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas\n\"If you already have a decent gaming laptop, you really shouldn’t look at the RTX 5090 twice. It doesn’t deliver much of an improvement over its last-generation counterpart, which remains excellent. However, if you’ve been waiting to upgrade to a high-end gaming laptop for a while, features like multi-frame generation and battery boost will make premium laptops powered by Nvidia’s latest even better.\"\nDell announced the return of the venerable Alienware Area-51 gaming laptop back in CES 2025, and starting today it is finally available to order. It comes in two size variants: the16\" model starts at $3,199.99and the18\" model starts at $3,399.99. As expected from Alienware's new flagship laptop, the Area-51 is equipped with current generation components, including the latest and greatest Intel Core Ultra 9 CPU and NVIDIA Blackwell GPU. Orders are expected to ship out starting April 30, so get your reservation in now to prevent any additional delays.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

This is a brand new and retail boxed product that is stocked in a US warehouse and qualifies for local delivery, which means it ships free and arrives quickly.\n\nThis genuine PlayStation console is imported from another country, however it will play in the US without any modifications.

Note that imported consoles have an overseas warranty that won't be honored here in the United States. Fortunately, AliExpress has a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days.\nAliExpress as a whole is a legitimate website, but since it is a marketplace comprised of individual sellers, you have to make sure that the vendor you're buying from is reputable. In many cases, the easiest way to do so is to look at the seller's rating and history. In terms of the products we've listed in this article, while it's true that some of the sellers may not have many reviews,AliExpress has reached out to us and personally vetted these vendors, which is why we feel comfortable promoting them.

Both models are also available at other retailers (see below).\n\nWhat makes this bundle stand out is that Astro Bot is included at no extra cost—effectively a free $70 game packed in with your console. If you needed an extra incentive to grab a PS5, this is it. Astro Bot isn’t just a throw-in; it was one of the best games of 2024, taking homeBest Game at The Game Awardsand cementing itself as a must-play for platforming fans.\nIf you want to be able to play games on disc, this is the one to get.\nIf you're cool with embracing the all-digital future, get this one.

A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive. And while you don’t need a long history with Sony systems to enjoy it, it is especially a delight for those with a piece of PlayStation in their heart as a treasure trove full of playable nostalgia awaits.\"\n\"Taking the PS5 marketing mantra that 'play has no limits' more seriously than you’d expect, Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it.\"\nFor those still on the fence about buying aPS5, this bundle makes for a compelling argument, and it's certainly one of thebest PS5 dealsgoing right now.

If you're in need of a new controller to play the newest games, likeCall of Duty: Black Ops 6which is on sale now as well, this is a fantastic opportunity.\nYou have to flaunt Amazon a little bit more of your cash to add a splash of style to your setup with one of these vivid color schemes likeAstral Purple, but it does seem worth it. What's more, these other models include the controller's updated design, featuring the X, A, B, and Y buttons being switched from their respective blue, green, red, and yellow colours to match that of their controllers' body.\nThe original button colours are still shown as tiny dots next to each one, but this update overall gives the controllers a more modest, sleeker appeal that arguably justifies the slightly larger price investment.\nFor those after a controller with a design that boasts more than one solid colour, Amazon UK also has the Special Fire Vapor Edition of the Xbox Series X|S controller as well,reduced by 20% to £51.99. Featuring titular vapor-like red-and-orange swirls, this bold colour scheme will invoke a little extra energy into your console setup if that's what you're looking for.\nBen Williams– IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

That's a great price for a newly released GPU that stands toe to toe with an RTX 5070 Ti (or RTX 4080), which could easily run you well over $2,000 in this absurd market.\n\nThis Skytech gaming PC is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 7700 processor, Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU, 16GB of DDR5  RAM, and 1TB M.2 SSD. This is a pretty nicely thought out configuration, with a competent AMD processor and DDR5 RAM with an optimal DDR5-6000MHz speed rating. The AMD Ryzen 7 7700 features a max boost clock speed of 5.3GHz with 8 cores, 16 threads, and a 32MB L2 cache. You won't see much of a gaming performance uplift if you were to go for a newer Ryzen 7 or even a Ryzen 9 processor, especially at higher resolutions.

I can’t predict the future, so only time will tell if the launch price holds up.

    "full_text": "While gaming has moved forward with bigger and more powerful consoles, theAtari 2600 Plusoffers a way to revisit the era of classic cartridge gaming. Right now, it'savailable for £50.13—half its usual price of £99.99—at its exclusive UK retailer, Amazon.\n\nReleased in November 2023, theAtari 2600 Plusmodernizes the original console’s design while maintaining compatibility with both Atari 2600 and 7800 cartridges. It connects easily to modern TVs via HDMI and includes a widescreen mode to better fit contemporary screens.\nIf you still have old cartridges like Space Invaders or Asteroids, they’ll run just as you remember. The system also comes with a CX40+ Joystick Controller, faithfully recreating the original’s design, along with a 10-in-1 cartridge featuring titles like Combat, Missile Command, and Yars’ Revenge:\nFor those looking to expand their collection, a second joystick is available separately for multiplayer games, and the 4-in-1 Game Cartridge Plus Paddle Pack adds titles like Breakout and Night Driver.\nWith its mix of nostalgia and modern convenience, the Atari 2600 Plus makes it easy to revisit classic games. And with this price drop, it’s a good time to pick one up.\nIn ourAtati 2600 Plus review, IGN's Seth Macy had this to say: \"Every time I walk past the Atari 2600+ sitting on the floor of my living room, controllers and games scattered around it, I'm instantly transported to the 1980s. Everything about its design is painstakingly authentic to the original while making necessary updates to bring it into the modern era. Atari collecting is easier than newer systems, but playing those carts has always been a bit tough since the original hardware was designed for an era when few TVs had coax inputs, much less composite video.\"\n\"Being able to output to HDMI makes playing your original carts a snap, although seeing Combat on a 65\" 4K screen doesn't really add anything to the experience. The Atari 2600+ is a fantastic upgrade to the original hardware that stays faithful to the original where it counts the most.

    "full_text": "Amazon is hosting aBig Spring Salethis week (March 25-31), with deals on selectbooks,Blu-rays, toys, and more. Sure, some toys are meant for kids, but when it comes toNerf guns, LEGO (like theLEGO Wednesday Set) and beloved character plushies, I think anyone can enjoy these cozy collectibles.\n\nI've rounded up the best deals I could find across popular franchises and characters, includingPokémon, TMNT, Disney, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and beyond. Whether you're buying for yourself or want to gift to a loved one, these cute plushies are affordable, adorable, and worth checking out.\nOne of the most popular plushie types sold these days is reversible plushies, giving you two sides of a character. It's essentially a two-in-one collectible, allowing you to switch up the expression you want to display based on your own mood on any given day. The TeeTurtle brand is one of the most common brands offering reviersible plushies, which is found above from Avatar: The Last Airbender, TMNT, and the Axolotl stuffed animals.\nA personal favorite of mine is theInside Out 2 Embarrassed Character plush. I love the Inside Out movies and characters, and I appreciate the fact the plush is weighted for extra comfort and anxiety relief. Plus, it's only $14.40. In fact, most of these picks are below $15 with the exception of Kirby and Grogu!\nTheSquishmallows Storeis loaded with fan-favorites right now on Amazon. There are select 10-inch Harry Potter plushies on sale, a cute lava lamp plush, a huggable Iron Man plush, and more squishy pals you can collect below during the Big Spring Sale.\nAsPokémon toysremain popular, it's rare to see big Pokémon plushie deals on the most popular characters. That said, depending on the size and type you're seeking to find, there actually are some on sale this week, so don't miss out!\nWhile Amazon is one of the more convenient places to shop, it isn't the only place where you canbuy popular plushies. Two of the best alternatives to Amazon are Target and Walmart, which will often have inventory when Amazon runs out. These two retailers also usually have more 20-inch versions in stock as well. For Pokémon fans specifically, you can also findPokémon SquishmallowsfromPokemon Center.\nLindsey (she/her) is IGN's Director of Audience Development and Commerce.

    "full_text": "GameCube games coming exclusively to the Switch 2'sexclusive online library is one of the best features of the new console. To make those membership costs just that little bit easier, UK retailerShopTohas NSO at 35% off right now, and there's an extra 5% when you use code SPRING at checkout. As you get yourNintendo Switch 2 preordersin, this is an absolute bonus bargain to consider.\n\nWhile some Nintendo Classics catalogues are unlocked with the base online subscription, you'll also need the Expansion Pack to play GameCube titles on Nintendo Switch 2. What's more, while you can subscribe to a monthly model for just Nintendo Switch Online, the Expansion Pack is only available on the 12-month plan, so make a note when purchasing.\nCurrently, the individual versions of these combined 12-month subscriptions cost either £34.99 on the Nintendo eShop or £39.99 at retailers like ShopTo. But now, it seems like ShopTo are keen to get on the Switch 2 hype by slashing £14.14 off the individual plan and £15.14 off the family plans respectively.\nSo, if you're the only Nintendo Switch players in your household, you can buy theindividual Online + Expansion Pack plan for £24.55or theFamily Membership for £43.55with the promo code SPRING.\nOverall, the family version is fantastic value as you can have up to eight Nintendo Accounts under a Family Group sharing the same membership, and you don't have to be in the same household either.\nUnder ShopTo's new price, that's as low as £5.60 per person getting to enjoy Nintendo Switch Online and the entire Expansion Pack's catalogue of games—including GameCube gemsPokemon XD: Gale of Darkness,Soulcalibur 2, andThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker— for a whole year.\nIf you're like me, though, and have already have a basic Nintendo Switch Online membership active until next year, the only way to upgrade is through Nintendo themselves—either on their website or the eShop—without a direct discount from retailers like ShopTo.\nHowever, a way to get around that is by purchasingdiscounted digital Nintendo eShop gift cards from Currys. Buy entering the code \"NINTENDODIGITAL10\" at checkout, you'll get 10% off on£15,£25,£50,£75, and£100amounts of eShop credit—saving you as much as £10.\nIn the case of upgrading your 12-month Nintendo Switch Online membership, the cost of which varies depending on how much is left, you can buy the closest amount you need or a larger amount at a bigger discount, and use any extra credit you have on digital games or save it to put toward your subscription next year.\nBen Williams– IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

Pretty much anything I could ever want can be sent directly to me in seemingly no time flat. It's an incredible thing, and yet part of me still yearns for the experience of getting something in person. It feels like it's more of an actual event and a memory you'll have forever.\n\nWith theNintendo Switch 2 preordersstarting soon, Best Buyhas announcedthat customers will have the option to pick up the new console at their local store at the stroke of midnight EST. It's the earliest possible time fans can get their hands on the Switch 2, withWalmart offering free deliveriesbefore 9 a.m. on June 5. While having it shipped directly to me would be the easiest path, the idea of actually going somewhere to secure the console with my own two hands appeals to me a lot more. If I do end up getting a preorder for the Switch 2, I'm going to choose to wait in line and make a big deal out of it.\nEditor's Note: Due to tariffs in the U.S.,Switch 2 preorders have been delayedat Best Buy.\nBest Buy preorders for the Switch 2 console, Switch 2 games, and its accessoriesbegin on Wednesday, April 9. If you're able to secure a console before stock disappears, you'll be able to choose preorder pickup at your local Best Buy location. You cansign up to get notificationsdirectly from Best Buy about all things Switch 2. Best Buy stated that most stores will be open at midnight ET on launch day— June 5— for pickup.\nYou can always use Google Maps to find your local Best Buy, but you can also use the tech retailer'sstore locater pageto find all locations in your surrounding area. You can widen the range of your search by simply expanding the map and see if the closest store is actually worth the drive.\nIn case you aren't familiar with Best Buy's memberships, there are a total of three. There's the free My Best Buy membership (which you'll need to preorder), My Best Buy Plus, and My Best Buy Total. Only the Plus and Total memberships are offering rewards for Nintendo purchases, but the rewards themselves are worth considering. You'll get a $20 certificate for every $150 you spend on Nintendo games and gear.\nThis sounds great in theory, if the Switch 2 itself was a qualifying purchase, but thefine print of the offer statesthat all Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 hardware is disqualified. With the price of someNintendo Switch 2 gamessitting at $80, though, you could easily spend over $150 with just two new game preorders.\n💥 Don't forget tobookmark our Switch 2 pre-order guidefor the latest updates & be the first to know about where you can buy the new Switch!💥"

    "publishedAt": "2025-03-19T19:30:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ecoflow-power-station-deals",
    "full_text": "Ecoflow is one of the largest and most well-known manufacturers of portable power stations. Their products are solidly built with a lot of practical features at an affordable price point. Product support after the purchase is generally pretty good, and  firmware and software updates are consistently rolled out.\n\nEcoflow sells their power stations on several different marketplaces including Amazon, Costco, Walmart, eBay, and even directly on its own site. However, if you want the best deals on new (not refurbished) products, you'll have to head on over to AliExpress. There, Ecoflow sells its products under the handleEcoflow Local US Store. Their products ship from a local US-based warehouse and usually arrives within 3-5 days (past 20 days and you'll get a complete refund). Since Ecoflow itself is the seller, you're entitled to the 5 year factory warranty.\nBelow is a brief description of each power station that's on sale right now. Ecoflow carries several models and many of them have similar names, so it can be confusing trying to figure out which power station is right for you.\nTheEcoflow River 3230Wh LiFePO4 Power Station is the most recent release in the River series.  It's about 30% more compact than the River 2. You can get it for $112 shipped after coupon code \"IFP3TXY\". The River 3 uses LiFEPO4 batteries with a 230Whr capacity. It has two AC outlets capable of 300W (600W surge), two USB Type-A ports, and one USB Type-C port with 100W of Power Delivery. The River 3 can be recharged using traditional AC and it will only take about one hour. Alternatively, you can recharge it using solar panels with a 110W max input. It can be monitored and controlled remotely via the Ecoflow app.\nUnlike the Ecoflow River series, which are designed to be easily portable, the Ecoflow Delta prioritizes battery capacity at the expense of a much heavier weight. These are the power stations you want if you're thinking of replacing generators that can supply larger appliances and more power hungry electronics. The Ecoflow Delta 2 comes in two variants. The950Whr modelis $349.43 and the1024Whr modelis $375.53, both after a $50 off coupon code \"IFPD5NS\". The Delta 2 uses LiFePO4 batteries and can be expanded with additional battery packs. It has six AC outlets with up to 1800W output (2700W surge), four USB Type-A outputs (two with 18W fast-charge capability), and two USB Type-C outputs with 100W Power Delivery. It can be recharged via AC or with up to 500W worth of solar panels.\nTheEcoflow River 2240Wh LiFePO4 Power Station is on sale for $124.87 shipped after you apply a $15 off coupon code \"IFP3TXY\". The River 2 uses LiFePO4 batteries with a 240Whr capacity. It has two AC outlets capable of 300W (600W surge), two USB Type-A ports, and one USB Type-C port capable of 60W Power Delivery.\nTheEcoflow River 2 Maxsits right in between the River 2 and the River 2 Pro in terms of battery capacity, power output, weight, and price. It's currently $204.23 shipped at AliExpress after a $20 off coupon code \"IFP7FJZ\". The River 2 Max uses LiFePO4 batteries with a 499Whr capacity. It has four AC outlets capable of 500W (1,000W surge), three USB Type-A ports, and one USB Type-C port with 100W Power Delivery. It weighs about 13 pounds.\nTheEcoflow River 2 Pro716Wh LiFePO4 Power Station is just $240 shipped after you apply a $40 off coupon code \"IFPI3V5\". This is a far more powerful version of the River 2, with nearly triple the battery capacity (716Whr). Like the River 2, the River 2 Pro uses LiFEPO4 batteries. It has four AC outlets capable of 800W (1,600W surge), three USB Type-A ports, and one USB Type-C port with 100W Power Delivery. It's heavier at 17 pounds, but still light enough to move around.\nTheEcoflow Delta 2 Maxoffers nearly 2Kwhr of battery storage at an excellent price of $870.88 shipped after a $100 off coupon code \"IFPRZAZ\". The free shipping is nice because this beast weighs over 50 pounds. If you don't mind getting a refurbished model,Ecoflow's eBay storehas it for only $759 shipped. This power station has six AC outlets with a massive 2,400W total output (4,800W surge) for even the most power hungry of appliances and power tools.\nIf you don't mind buying a certified refurbished unit,Ecoflow's eBay Storeis your next best bet for finding the best deal. These prices are a bit lower than what you'll find on AliExpress and you'll get the same 5 year warranty as buying new. Also, Ecoflow states that \"On average, our refurbished products are only used around 10 cycles. This means that they've only been charged and discharged fully a total of 10 times. Since many of our newer products (DELTA Pro, RIVER 2/DELTA 2 series) have cycle lives of 3000+, this is only a tiny fraction of their lifespan.\"\nCheck out theAliExpress US Anniversary Salefor more deals on consoles and gaming accessories.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "title": "Flexispot Spring Sale Is Live: Save up to 60% Off Electric Standing Desks and Ergonomic Chairs",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-26T03:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/flexispot-spring-sale-2025-ergonomic-office-chairs-electric-standing-desks",
    "full_text": "Flexispot is running itsSpring Salewith up to 60% off the brand's most popular standing desks and ergonomic chairs. We like Flexispot because it offers quality electric standing desks with all the features you'd want at a fraction of the price compared to other more well-known models. We rated Flexispot's highes- end model, the E7 Pro, thebest overall standing desk of 2025. I've been using a Flexispot desk for years now and wouldn't pay more for a \"better\" desk.\n\nYou can quickly browse through all of the listed products on sale above. For more information on each product and why they are worth your consideration, read through below.\nThe Flexispot C7 offers a ton of features that are typically reserved for much more expensive chairs. This includes an automatically adjusting lumbar system, adjustable seat depth, adjustable armrests, adjustable seat tilt, adjustable headrest, 128 degrees of recline, and more.\nFlexispot C7 Review(without footrest) by Bill Loguidice\nThe FlexiSpot C7 is a solid chair. For the price, however, I would have preferred a more premium-feeling leather or leather-like material instead of fabric, as well as more attention to some other aspects like cushioning. I also found the fact that you can't lock the wrist rests in place an occasional annoyance. If you don't mind some of its quirks and prize adjustment in a chair, then the C7 makes a good choice. Compared to straight-up gaming chairs, its sedate styling means it won't be out of place in even the most conservative of office environments. If you'd like a flashier or more luxurious offering, however, look elsewhere.\nThe Flexispot E5 desk is, in my opinion, the best value electric standing desk while still offering all the premium features you'd want. Right now it costs $199.99 (normally $379.99) for the base only and desktop surfaces start at $80. The Flexispot E5 is the least expensive model featuringdual motors, which are preferred over a single motor because they can support more weight (in this case 287lbs max) and they last longer because the stress is evenly distributed. The desktop is supported by a double crossbeam structure so that your surface is evenly supported to prevent any sagging. Most standing desks in this price range only have legs with a two-stage column, but this one features a three-stage column, which supports a greater vertical range (in this case 23.6\" to 49.2\"). An anti-collision feature, a must-have in all desks, will stop the desk when it detects obstruction of the motor. Finally, the keypad controls offer three memory presets and a timer to remind you when to swap sit/stand positions. The E5 comes with a 10-year warranty on all metal, mechanical, and electrical parts and components, including the motor.\nThe E7 currently costs $299.99 (normally $499.99) for the base only and desktop surfaces start at $80. For an extra $140, the Flexispot E7 offers better build quality, a higher weight threshold, more included accessories, and a longer warranty. The lifting capacity has been upgraded from 287lbs to 355lbs. Aesthetically, the legs look more professional, with laser-welded seams, powder-coated finish, and no visible holes. The advanced keyboard has been upgraded with an LCD display, more memory presets, a built-in USB charger, and a child-lock function that's a necessity for those of us with inquisitive toddlers. The E7 also comes with a built-in cable tray under the desk to stow away all of your messy wiring. Finally, the Flexispot E7 boasts an increased 15-year warranty on all metal, mechanical, and electrical parts and components, including the motor.\nThe E7 Pro is the creme de la creme of Flexispot's standing desks. It's recent released so it isn't nearly as heavily discounted as the other models. Currently it costs $419.99 (normally $599.99) for the base only and desktop surfaces start at $80. The E7 Pro features the best build quality of the three listed here, and it certainly shows with a weight capacity of a whopping 440lbs. Flexispot claims the motor for the E7 Pro is superior to the standard dual motor setup you'll find in the E5 and E7 and other brands, offering smoother and faster movement. You also get more cable management options included than even the E7. The Flexispot E7 Pro comes with the same 15-year warranty as the E7 on all metal, mechanical, and electrical parts and components, including the motor. This is arguably thebest standing desk dealyou'll find anywhere right now.\nFlexispot E7 Pro Reviewby Billy Givens\n\"A simple but effective keypad, quiet dual motors, near-perfect cable management, and excellent stability make the FlexiSpot E7 Pro a top-tier standing desk for work or gaming. Whether it's your first desk purchase or a replacement for an older model, it's hard to find many better options in this price range.\"\nI have three standing desks. One of the standing desks included a desktop, however for the other two desks I sourced on my own. For one of them I purchased a massive74\"x26\" maple veneered countertop from Ikeafor $199. For the other one I purchased a48\"x25\" solid wood countertop from Home Depotand finished it myself. Personally, I don't think you can go wrong with any of those choices, and there are more options available. The point is, these standing desk bases don't need the desktops sold by the manufacturer. If you want to install your own desktop, by all means do so as long as they are within the weight limitations.\nI can only speak from personal experience. I own a Jarvis Fully, a Vari Ergo, and a Flexispot E5. All three are excellent desks that have caused me no problems whatsoever in the 3+ years of owning them, and that's the point. The Flexispot E5 is considerably less expensive than the other two options, and yet I don't really see where much of that cost is going. For a similar price of a barebones Jarvis Fully, you could get the top end Flexispot E7 Pro and still come out with more money in your pocket.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "full_text": "I think today might be the day my wallet throws in the towel. Woot is coming in hot with one of thebest PS5 game dealsI’ve seen all year, and Sony’s decided we’ve all earned a full-blown audio upgrade. Between the markdowns onnoise-canceling headphones,portable speakers, andhome theater gear, it's giving \"treat yourself\" energy with \"I won’t regret this at all\" delusion.\n\nI want at least three of these, but I’m pretending to be financially responsible and only putting two in my cart. If you’ve been eyeballing anything fromhigh-end headphonestosmart display cases for your action figures (I meancollectibles), now’s probably the best time to stop window shopping and start adding to your cart.\nThis Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code \"IFPRZAZ\" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16\" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.\n$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.\nI think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.\nIf you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.\nAt $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.\n$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.\nThis speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.\nCrisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.\nThis speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.\nBass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.\nXM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.\nA wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.\nMy living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.\nI didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.\nThis TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.\nI want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.\nThis one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.\nIf you're searching for your next new game to play,Humble Choice Marchis now live, and this is the perfect bundle to discover something new! This month, Homeworld 3 headlines the bundle, with other PC games like Wild Hearts, Pacific Drive, Zau, and Gravity Circuit also included. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars to grab these games individually, you can get all eight games for just $11.99 at Humble Bundle for this month only.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code \"PLAY5\" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.\nLast year the 9th generation iPad was the least expensive iPad you could get brand new and with warranty. It was regularly priced at $179, but it went out of stock pretty much everywhere starting from Black Friday. Fortunately, it's back for one final harrah; right now, Walmart has it available for delivery for only $179 shipped. Seriously though, this deal probably won't last much longer so don't hesitate.\nAmazon is offering this Iniu 20,000mAh 65W USB Power Bank for only $21.59 after you clip the 40% off coupon on the product page (if you don't see it, try applying promo code \"WN9GQJRA\"). This is a great price for a high-capacity power bank that can deliver more power than other power banks at the same price point. The 65W of power delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, and iPhone 16 at their fastest rates.\n4TB for $259.99\nSamsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.\nIf you're in the process of building out a new gaming PC and you're looking for the best gaming processor, this is it. Right now, the recently releasedAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DAM5 desktop processor is back in stock on Amazon and Best Buy at its retail price of $479 shipped. This is the official launch price with zero markup, and it's not bundled with anything you don't want or need. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming processor currently on the market (across both AMD and Intel) and a better choice for gamers than the more expensiveIntel Core Ultra 9 285K.\nAMD's new Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards have been released, but just like their Nvidia counterparts, they're mostly out of stock and impossible to find at retail pricing. Don't fret, however, because you can still get these GPUs equipped in a prebuilt gaming PC for a reasonable price. The Radeon RX 9070 GPUs are the new mid-range champions of this generation. Both cards offer phenomenal performance while undercutting their Nvidia competition.\nApple's best earbuds are on sale today. Amazon is offering the second generationApple AirPods Prowireless noise-canceling earbuds for only $169.99 shipped, a savings of 32% and the best AirPods deal so far this year. That's about $20 more than theApple AirPods 4 with ANC, down from its usual $70 price premium. Between the two, the AirPods Pro is stillthe superior earbudsbecause it offers better sound quality and noise cancelation.\nChromebooks aren't exactly gaming-minded PCs, but they're compact, lightweight, great for productivity on the go, and in this case, a bargain. As part of Best Buy's Deal of the Day, you can pick up thisAsus 14\" Chromebookfor just $119 shipped after a $180 off instant discount, although I'd say the MSRP is a tad inflated. Even so, that's still a fantastic deal for a chromebook that features a relatively recent 8-core MediaTek processor which pairs well with Google Chrome OS.\nYou can grab this 10,000mAh power bank for only $8.99 after you clip the 10% off and 40% off clippable coupons on the product page. We very rarely see 10,000mAh power banks listed for under $10 so grab this one while you can. This will charge a Nintendo Switch from 0% to 100% about 1.9 times.\nFor a limited time, Hulu is offering four months of Disney+ and Hulu Basic (Ad-Supported) Bundle for just $2.99 per month. The normal cost of this subscription is $10.99 per month. This deal only comes around a handful of times per year and worth it for just the Disney+ subscription alone.\nPick up a five pack of USB Type-C cables for a grand total of just $7.96 after you apply promo code \"UNWEXMFD\". That averages out to about $1.59 per cable. Lengths include two 3.3ft, two 6.6ft, and an extra long 10ft cable. They're all rated for up to 60W of USB Power Delivery and are encased in a durable braided nylon sheath.\nIf you're searching for your next new game to play,Humble Choice Marchis now live, and this is the perfect bundle to discover something new! This month, Homeworld 3 headlines the bundle, with other PC games like Wild Hearts, Pacific Drive, Zau, and Gravity Circuit also included.

    "full_text": "Here are the best deals for Wednesday, March 12. Highlights include a rare discount on a (used) PlayStation Portal accessory, Lenovo-exclusive price drops on PS5 DualSense metallic controllers, the first discount we've seen on the iPad Air with M3 chip, USB Type-C cables for only $2.99 apiece, Destiny-themed SteelSeries gaming headsets, and more.\n\nUsed: Like New Condition\nLooks and functions as if it were new. Moderate packing damage observed during inspection.\nThePlayStation Portalhas never been discounted, but at least you can save on a used one.Amazon Resale(a rebranded Amazon Warehouse) currently has Used: Like New condition PS Portals in stock for only $158.70 shipped. It retails for $199 new, so that's a substantial 20% in savings. A Sony warranty may or may not be included, but Amazon Resale items benefit from the same 30-day return policy you get for buying a new item. We expect this item to sell out pretty quickly.\nLenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code \"PLAY5\" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.\nAmazon is offering a 6-foot INIU USB Type-A to USB Type-C cable for only $2.99 when you apply promo code \"C2ALZ6LN\" during checkout. You can add as many cables as you like and the discount should be applied to each and every cable. These cables are sheathed in nylon braiding for durability and can be used for both data sync and charging (Quick Charge 3.1A compatible). This is a great opportunity to stock up.\nIf you're thinking of jumping on the AMD bandwagon for your next upgrade, now is certainly the right time to do so. Alongside theRyzen 7 9800X3Dwhich debuted earlier this year, AMD has just released its two higher-end Ryzen 9 siblings in the Zen 5 \"X3D\" stack: the9950X3Dis available for $699 and the9900X3Dis available for $599. Collectively, these processors represent the best gaming chips across both Intel and AMD. Pure gamers should go with the 9800X3D and allocate their funds elsewhere; creators with deeper pockets and a penchant for gaming will benefit from the immense performance uplift on the new Ryzen 9 processors thanks to their increased core count and cache.\nThenew iPad Airsits in the middle of Apple’s tablet lineup, with better specs than the baseline iPad, but it’s not as powerful as the iPad Pro. That said, if you need more computing power in a tablet than what the baseline device above offers, the new iPad Air with M3 chip will likely suit you just fine.\nAs you can tell by the name, it has Apple’s powerful M3 chip, and it supports Apple Intelligence, unlike the baseline model. It’s also compatible with a new Magic Keyboard (see it at Apple) that has a row of function keys and a trackpad.\nAs part of its Spring Sale, SteelSeries is taking 40% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets. The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Desinty 2 in-game items.\nAs part of a generalHP Days Sale Event, you can score an excellent deal on a 4K-capable gaming PC. Right now, theHP Omen 25L GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super Gaming PChas dropped to $1,399.99 shipped after you apply $50 off coupon code \"HPDAYSPC50\". This is quite easily the lowest price we've seen for a prebuilt RTX 4070 Ti Super gaming desktop.\nAmazon is offering a four-pack ofApple AirTagskeyfinders for only $64.49. That's over $35 off the retail price and only $16.10 for each AirTag. This is a very practical accessory for anyone who owns an iPhone and tends to lose small wearables like wallets, keys, or remotes.\n4TB for $259.99\nSamsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today.

    "title": "The AndaSeat April Sale Starts Now: Racing-Styled Gaming Chairs From $179",
    "publishedAt": "2025-04-02T21:45:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/andaseat-kaiser-novis-april-gaming-chair-sale-2025",
    "full_text": "AndaSeatisn't as big of a name in the congested gaming chair market as some other brands like Secretlab, DXRacer, or Razer, but rest assured it makes somehigh-quality gaming chairs. Right now, there's anAndaSeat April Salegoing on with up to $220 off gaming chairs. These instant discounts stack with our 10% off IGN code \"AndaIGN\".\n\nUse 10% off code: AndaIGN\nThe Kaiser 3 offers great value for a high-end gaming chair that competes with other chairs that cost $500 or more. The base model currently costs $386.10, which is about $60 cheaper than the Kaiser 4, and shares most of the same features. You lose out on the 5D armrests and the lumbar is less adjustable, but that's about it.\nIn hisAndaseat Kaiser 3 review, Mark Knapp wrote that \"The AndaSeat Kaiser 3 makes some meaningful improvements to the series’ design, including a wide seatbase that does away with metal bolsters for hours-long comfort and a flexible lumbar support built in. It uses magnets here and there in a gimmicky but not useless way, and it offers all the premiums that one should expect at this price in a well-polished package. It’s not quite perfect, still suffering some from the aggressive racing-style design, but it proves a great chair nonetheless.\"\nUse 10% off code: AndaIGN\nFor 2025, AndaSeat has just released a new line of gaming chair that's sure to be a hit with the budget-minded audience. TheAndaseat Novis gaming chair– which retails for just $199 – is now shipping. Even better, you can use our 10% off IGN code \"AndaIGN\" to drop the price further to $179.10. The Novis looks like it has most of the comfort, features, and styling of other high-end gaming chair minus some of the more common gimmicks (like \"4D\" armrests).\nUse 10% off code: AndaIGN\nThe Kaiser 4 is AndaSeat's flagship chair. The price normally starts from $569 but this sale drops it to $476.10 after the IGN code. It's only available in Extra Large with a weight capabity of 395lbs so this is a very spacious chair. You can choose among eight different color options in PVC leather or two different color options in fabric. It has all of the creature comforts you'd expect in a quality gaming chair, like a unibody 2mm tubular steel frame, one-piece high density foam with a plush seat bottom (softer, in my experience, than the very firm Secretlab seat), four-way lumbar adjustment system, 5D armrests, up to 135 degrees of recline and a rocking toggle, included magnetic armrests, and more. This chair sounds a lot like the Titan Evo, and you'd be right; the design, features, and build quality are very similar, minus the price tag.\nOverall, Mark Knapp didn't like it as much as the Kaiser 3, however. In hisAndaseat Kaiser 4 review, he wrote that \"The AndaSeat Kaiser 4 has great lumbar support and one of the best headrest pillows you'll find on the market, but its janky armrests are a major blemish on the overall design, and its firm seat won't be for everyone. If you have the AndaSeat Kaiser 3, everything but the lumbar support may feel like more of a downgrade than an upgrade – and if this is your first gaming chair, you can do much better within the premium market.\"\nUse 10% off code: AndaIGN\nIf you don't care for the distinct styling of gaming chairs, Andaseat also recently released a traditional-style task chair model called the X-Air. It's also less expensive, with the standard model starting at only $341.10 after the coupon is applied. This chair features a softer suede-like material that feels more comfortable than traditional mesh chairs. It comes standard with plenty of adjustability, but you can upgrade to the Pro model to get the dynamic lumbar adjustment, 5D armrests, and a 3D headrest. The Pro model also comes in a couple of very unique colors.\nBoth the Andaseat Kaiser 4 and 3 are excellent gaming chairs that are on par with the quality you'll find from more expensive chair manufacturers. That said, if you're willing to spend substantially more,Secretlabis still ourfavorite gaming chair brand. Secretlab recently released its flagship Titan Evo chair in a \"Nanogen\" edition and it is, in our opinion, the new best gaming chair. In ourTitan Evo Nanogen Edition review, Chris Coke wrote that \"the Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen Edition deserves every bit of the overwhelming praise I’ve given. Granted, at $799 it’s significantly more expensive than the original and not far off from an entry-level Herman-Miller. But the return it offers in comfortable, supportive gaming is well worth the extra cost thanks to dramatically improved materials in both the fabric and multi-layered padding. The Titan Evo Nanogen Edition is class-leading, and is hands-down the most comfortable gaming chair I’ve ever used.\"\nSecretlab also released anew recliner add-onto anyone who already owns the Titan Evo chair, and it has turned out to be a very practical addition that's worthy of its lofty $200 price point. In ourrecliner add-on review, Chris Coke wrote that \"while both comfort and value are subjective things, the recliner is able to take the Titan Evo and transform it from one of the best racing style gaming chairs to standing head and shoulders above the competition at its price point. It’s novel enough that I wouldn’t be surprised to see other brands following suit in the near future. If you don’t mind paying for it, it’s an absolutely killer upgrade for your gaming chair.\"\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

While everyone scrambles forPrismatic Evolutionsand floods paid Discord servers hunting for Rival Destinies, thesmartmove is picking up older sets from the Scarlet & Violet and Sword & Shield eras before they disappear—especially now that Amazon just got a massive restock.\n\nYou won’t find Prismatic Evolutions or muchSurging Sparksstock just yet, but for collectors, this is a gold mine.ETBs, Big Boxes, Booster Bundles, and more are all here—straight from Amazon Global. That means stock has been pulled from the UK and other regions to ensure wider availability.\nThis is exactly what the community needs: a flood of inventory that makes botting and scalping far less appealing. I've dug through everything, and just to make things easier, sorted it all by category alongside a handy TL;DR just below.\nAll of these ETBs are harder to come by thanks to Pokémania 2025. There's some amazing cards to be found in these sets, from Greninja Secret Art Rare (214/167) found inTwilight Masqueradeto The Loyal Three Secret Art Rare set found inShrouded Fable.\nSurging Sparks Booster Bundle is the biggest restock here thanks to the infamous Pikachu ex Secret Illustration Rare (238/191) and the sets other amazin cards such as Latias ex Special Illustration Rare (239/191) and Milotic ex Special Illustration Rare (237/191). It's also a great time to snap up from Brilliant Stars boosters, with chances of pulling Charizard V Alternate Art (154/172) and the stunning trainer gallery sub-set.\nWhilst these are the most awkward thing to display or store for collectors, there's some cool promo cards andaccessoriesfor TCG players. There's even some discounts knocking around, such as the Paradox Fury Premium collection down 12% at $60.11. This is probably one of the better boxes to buy from this restock as it's a 2024 Amazon holiday exclusive.\nThere's a collectors scene for just the tins people, and they come in handy for storing bulk, dice, sleeves and whgatever else trainers need to their battles.\nA good tip here is to buy anything with a Pokémon V card as their promo card. This means you'll get Sword and Shield era booster packs inside, which are going to be harder and harder to find as we move into the second half of 2025.\nIf you looking for frequent updates on Pokémon TCG products, I'm constantly updatingWhere To Buy Prismatic Evolutions,Prismatic Evolutions Super Premium Collection, andBest Pokémon TCG deals.\nChristian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

    "full_text": "Amazon’s Big Spring Sale will soon reach its conclusion today, March 31, so you've got until the end of the day to secure a great deal. While it might not have the same hype as Black Friday or Prime Day, the discounts speak for themselves, and there's so many great offers to choose from still— including the lowest prices of the year on tech like Apple AirPods, Kindles, Fire TV Sticks, and must-have items like50 series GPUs, andPokémon TCG cardsback in stock for a limited time.\n\nAmazon’s dedicatedSpring Sale hub has plenty of deals, but we’ve done the heavy lifting for you on the final day of the sale, highlighting only the best discountsactuallyworth your time. Every deal we feature is either at its lowest-ever price, matches its best price of the year so far, or is so hotly sought after we can't help but mention it. We’re keeping this list fresh with real-time updates, so you won’t miss out on the biggest savings before the sale ends.\nThere are already some incredible doorbuster deals in the Amazon Spring Sale 2025. One of the best is theINIU 10K power bank for just $9with code S7LY7824 and clipping the 50% coupon – a record low price. It’s an absolute must-buy, especially for iPhone users, but even beyond that, it’s just anoutstanding power bankat an unbeatable price. If you grab only one thing from this sale, make it this. You can findmore coupons worth clippingto score additional savings on books, robot vacuums and more.\nOther tech deals include the standard slate ofApple products, likeAirPodsand thenewest Apple Watch, as well as Amazon devices likeFire TV.\nIt'd be silly not to mention thelatest round of Pokémon TCG stock at Amazonduring the sale, with elusive Elite Trainer Boxes like Twilight Masquerade available again, alongside a slew of other hot booster sets likeSurging Sparks.\nOne of our favorite deals during theSpring Sale is The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Editions, all at all time low discounts, and in thebuy two get one freedeal. It's one of the best offers we've seen all year.Sunrise on the Reaping, the new Hunger Games novel, should also be on your radar.\nOther books in the sale include chart-topper Onyx Storm, and its fellow Empyrean series booksIron FlameandFourth Wing, alongside theHarry Potter Illustrated Books.\nFor just individual book deals, we also love theSkyrim Library, a three-volume collection of texts, now down to just$49.99 when clipping the coupon at Amazon. A gloriously good deal for a magnificent set of books. We've also seen plenty ofcomics, likeUltimate Spider-Man, and even select vinyl (also within the 3 for 2 promotion) included in the deals.\nLEGO sets are getting more expensive, but they always seem to get solid discounts during these types of sales. Some of thebest LEGO dealsfrom the current sale include discounts on theLEGO Wednesday collaborationas well as some very cozyLEGO Animal Crossing sets. Some of ourfavorite board gamesfor both families and adults are included in the sale. We've also seen tons of deals on 90's comebacks includingaction figures,plushies,Nerf gunsand evenBop It! toys(that apparently still exist).\nAmazon has also discounted tons ofindividual movies and TV shows, includingold-school Warner Bros. cartoonsandfilms directed by David Lynch.\nIt's always the right time to get accessories you actually need, but it's even better to get them on sale. That said, Amazon has discounts on variousPS Portal accessory deals. My other favorites that are worth considering includeAudible Premium Plus for $0.99, theApple AirPods Pro 2 for $169.99,Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth for $32.99, and65\" LG C4 4K OLED Smart TV for $1,397.\nThe Amazon Spring Sale (March 25-31) couldn’t come at a better time. With no major shopping holidays between now and Memorial Day, this is one of the best opportunities to score great deals before summer. WhilePrime DayandBlack Fridaymight bring even steeper discounts, those are months away – if you’re looking to save right now, this sale is your best bet.\nThat said, strategic shopping always wins. If you’re eyeing a big-ticket item like aTVorKindlebut don’t need it immediately, waiting for a larger sale could be worth it. Want to make sure you’re getting the best possible price? Tools likeCamelCamelCamellet you track pricing history, helping you spot real deals from the ones that justlookgood.

    "full_text": "Localthunk, the developer behind breakout roguelike poker gameBalatro, has stepped in to resolve a bit of a scrum in the Balatro subreddit over a mod's statements on AI art.\n\nIt's a bit of a wild story, so bear with me here, and thanks toGarbage DayandRock Paper Shotgunfor spotting all this. Essentially, it starts with DrTankHead, a now-former moderator of the Balatro subreddit and also current mod of a NSFW Balatro subreddit.\nThe moderator had expressed no issue with AI art content, both on the NSFW and main Balatro subreddits. \"We will not be banning AI art here, if it is properly claimed and tagged as such,\" the mod saidin a post. \"This has been done after discussion with the staff at Playstack.\"\nLocalthunkposted a short reply on Bluesky, saying this is not how they, nor their publisher at Playstack, felt about AI generated imagery. Then, the developerwent to the subreddit to make a full statement.\n\"Neither Playstack nor I condone AI 'art'. I don't use it in my game, I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds. The actions of this mod do not reflect how Playstack feels or how I feel on the topic. We have removed this moderator from the moderation team,\" Localthunk said.\n\"We will not be allowing AI generated images on this subreddit from now on. We will make sure our rules and FAQ reflect this soon.\"\nIn afollow-up, Playstack's communications director noted that the rules around this \"should have been clearer,\" as a rule calling for \"no unlabeled AI content\"could have been interpretedas allowing or supporting the content on the subreddit. The remaining mod team is planning on clarifying this language for the future.\nAs for the original mod, DrTankHeadpostedin the aforementioned NSFW Balatro subreddit, confirming they've been removed as a mod of r/Balatro.

    "full_text": "If you've been hunting forScarlet & Violet Prismatic Evolutionsbooster packs without getting fleeced by scalpers,Amazon’slatest offer is a tough fallback.This six-pack booster bundle is listed at $59.99—more than double the expected MSRP of around $27. That’s a staggering 122% markup, and with demand still outpacing supply, even Amazon has hiked its prices well above retail.\n\nThe availability is still good, as you’re not fighting bots or hoping your local store remembered to stock anything. This is probably your best shot today that doesn’t involve rolling the dice with potential scams through third-party sellers. Still, if you do decide to buy, do it with a fair warning that this is a heavily increased price.\nPrismatic Evolutionsis stacked. This is an Eeveelution collector’s dream (and a wallet’s nightmare). The Special Illustration Rare cards in this set are already climbing to jaw-dropping prices on resale sites.\nThe single card market, however, is a different story. Prices are slowly coming down, with Dragapult ex coming right down from over $100 to around $45 alongside Roaring Moon ex.\nUmbreon ex (161/131) is the crown jewel, going for a laughable $1,298 in lightly played condition. It’s absurd, but it’s exactly the kind of pull that justifies ripping packs like a gremlin. Sylveon ex (156/131) isn’t far behind, selling around $450 depending on condition, and Espeon ex (155/131) continues the psychic-type price madness with listings near $300. Some sellers are offering copies in the $90 range, but blink and those are gone.\nJolteon ex (153/131) brings the lightning with prices hovering around $265 for near mint, although listings under $100 do pop up — briefly. And then there's the rest of the Eevee family: Vaporeon, Flareon, Glaceon, and Leafeon ex are all pulling serious numbers, with some copies going well over $250, and even the “low” end listings still sitting in the $75–$100 range.\nOf course, it’s not just about the Eeveelutions. Pikachu ex (179/131) might be one of the few heavy hitters in this set that’s still hovering under $100, currently around $70, but Pikachu is never a bad pull recently. Roaring Moon ex and Dragapult ex round out the list of top chase cards. Both are popular picks, with prices ranging from $45 to $200 depending on the condition and the whims of the secondary market.\nChristian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

    "full_text": "Anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch will know about Joy-Con stick drift. It’s when the Joy-Con Control Sticks stop responding correctly, or suffer from \"drifting.\"\n\nComplaints aboutJoy-Con driftwere so loud that Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa apologized for the \"inconvenience\" and launched a free repair program. Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has talked about the \"battle against\" Joy-Con drift, insisting Nintendo was making continuous improvements. It was such a big problem that parents in the U.S. tried to sue over Joy-Con drift in a class-action lawsuit, although Nintendo ended up fending that off.\nIn 2022, a UK consumer group allegedNintendo Switch's Joy-Con drift issue was caused by a fundamental design flaw. A report from Which claimed that, even after just a few months of use, the Joy-Con's plastic circuit boards show significant wear on the joystick slider contact points,causing Joy-Con drift.\nThis week, Nintendo fully unveiled the $449.99 Switch 2 in a Nintendo Direct, showing off the new Joy-Con 2 and its extra functionality. InNintendo Switch 2 tech specspublished by the company, there is no detail on the sticks themselves. So as of now, we don’t know for sure if Joy-Con 2 use the hall effect sensors Nintendo fans are desperate for.\nAs Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto described in a new 'Ask the Developer' interview, the Switch 2's Joy-Cons have “larger and more durable” analog sticks “with smoother movement.”\nIt was a similarly vague response when Nintendo was asked about Joy-Con drift improvements at a hardware-focused roundtable Q&A in New York yesterday, attended by IGN.\nTetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, told the assembled media that the new Joy-Con 2 controllers were redesigned “from the ground up,” but failed to say anything specific about drifting.\n“As you may have witnessed and felt, the new Joy-Con 2 controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been really designed from the ground up, from scratch, and they've been designed to have bigger movement and also smoother movement,” Sasaki said.\nIn the 'Ask the Developer' interview, Kawamoto talked about the new Switch 2 Pro Controller and its sticks, saying they’re \"quieter.\"\n“Aside from the color, the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller may look indistinguishable from the previous controller at first glance, but it was also redesigned from scratch,” Kawamoto explained.\n“In particular, the left and right control sticks are quieter and don’t make noise, even when they’re moved quickly to the edge. Also, they glide very smoothly, so we've taken to calling them ‘smooth-gliding sticks.’ (Laughs)”\nSasaki added: \"As they’re calling them ‘smooth-gliding sticks,’ we made efforts to reduce the feeling of bumping when you tilt them. In fact, there's been a long-running project at Nintendo with the grand ambition of developing the ‘pinnacle of all controllers,’ and we’ve been researching it hard for a long time now.”\nThe proof of the pudding is in the eating, of course. We won’t know how the Switch 2 Joy-Con hold up under strain perhaps until years after the console comes out. But hopefully, based on what Nintendo is saying now, Joy-Con drift will be a thing of the past.\nFor more, check outeverything announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct, andwhat the experts have to say about the Switch 2 price and Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "title": "Capcom Was on Its Knees After Resident Evil 6, Now Monster Hunter Wilds Cements Its Golden Era — Here's How It Did It",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-12T12:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-golden-age-the-rise-and-fall-resident-evil-monster-hunter-wilds",
    "full_text": "With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its wayandits audience.\n\nCapcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.\nBut in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.\n2016 was a bad year for Capcom.\nThe big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.\nThis was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.\nAll of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .\nAchieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.\nCapcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4.\n2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema.\nUnfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.\n“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.\nThis directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op.\nThis downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.\nBut it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.\nThis slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.\nIt was clear something needed to change.\nBy the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability.\nWhile neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.\n“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”\nThose constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6.\n\"We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V,\" Nakayama says. \"And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title.\"\nAll this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards.“There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.\n“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”\nThe team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.\nThere was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master.\n“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.”\nStreet Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series.\nWhile they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.\nWhile Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.\nAround the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience.\n“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”\nIf you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.\n“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”\nItsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance.\nNo other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened.\nFirstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.\n“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”\nMonster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.\nThis created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.\nBut the reality was that Monster Hunterdidhave fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.\nReleased in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.\n“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”\nIt was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”\nIt wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world.\n“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”Tsujimoto says.\nOne important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.\nThis explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.\n“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”\nMonster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call.\n“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&D teams were divided into R&D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”\nTakeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.\nThere were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.\n“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.\nThe game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series.\nBut Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time.\n“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.\nThe result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history.\nNaturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?\nAmpo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”\nBut despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.\nAround the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.\n“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.”\nItsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.\nThe 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. \"Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively,\" Itsuno says. \"When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”\nThis vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should.\nAmpo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, \"So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.”\nThis meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.\n“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”\nSince 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.\nFocusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat.\nBut what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.\nMany of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever.\nWhen asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”\nMonster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”\nMatt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor."

    "title": "Deals For Today: Pokémon TCG Prismatic Evolutions Restock And PlayArts Assassin's Creed Statues Up For Preorder",
    "publishedAt": "2025-04-03T10:03:35Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-3-2025",
    "full_text": "There’s a fine line between “I deserve this” and “this was a financial mistake,” and today’s deals are absolutely walking it. I’m looking at In Stock Pokémon bundles that practically dare you to stop at just one. Humble Choice is finally delivering a lineup that doesn’t feel like leftovers, and the Assassin’s Creed collectibles over in the IGN Store have officially moved from “maybe someday” to “I’ve added it to my cart twice already.”\n\nIn my opinion, these are the kinds of deals that are actually worth talking about — not the 7% off a charger you didn’t need to begin with. This is six-pack booster bundles available now, games I’ve had on my wishlist for too long, and statues that will silently judge you from a shelf while looking really, really cool. If you're going to buy stuff, at least let it be stuff that makes you happy and mildly ashamed.\nFrom ourpreview: \"Based on the Loyal Three and their Moochi-feeding mythical master, Pecharunt, the Shrouded Fable set features some key players of thePokémon Scarlet & Violet DLC: Hidden Treasures of Area Zero, amongst new additions. It's a packed set, with Kingdra ex also making a royal splash in the expansion.\"\nThis one’s a bit of a reality check. The actual MSRP for six of these packs is around $27, so Amazon is being bold by doubling that and calling it a deal. Still, given how hard Prismatic Evolutions is to find at retail without hunting down individual packs like a Pokédex-obsessed raccoon, this is sadly one of the better options right now. I wouldn’t call it a bargain, but if you’re just itching to crack open some fresh packs without resorting to third-party sellers, it gets the job done.\nThis is one of the few Pokémon TCG products still hovering close to MSRP, which basically qualifies it as a miracle in 2025. You get three solid booster packs, some stickers to slap on your laptop or emotional baggage, and a stackable tin that may or may not match the others in your accidental collection. It’s not flashy, but it’s a solid option if you just want some new packs to rip without playing the “Is this seller legit?” game.\nThis month’s Humble Choice doesn’t feel like a clearance rack, and that’s saying something. Tomb Raider is doing the nostalgia thing in the best way, and Dredge is that weird horror-fishing crossover I didn’t know I needed. Aliens: Dark Descent rounds it out if you like your sci-fi chaotic and stressful. Honestly, I’d pay the $12 just for those three — and still walk away feeling smug.\nThis bundle is a case of “available at a premium or not at all.” MSRP should be closer to $27, but good luck finding that price in the wild. The return of Shiny Pokémon is the big hook here, and that’s probably what’s driving the markup. I think it’s steep, but if you’ve been chasing the set and want to avoid eBay roulette, this is probably your safest play.\nThis is the kind of collectible that makes you pause and consider rearranging your entire shelf, your priorities, and your bank account. Some of these statues are genuinely beautiful. Others are so expensive they make me nervous just looking at them. But if you’ve got deep franchise loyalty and shallow impulse control, this is your moment.\nElite Trainer Boxes are rarely good dollar-per-pack deals, and this one’s no exception. But what you’re really paying for is the full kit: sleeves, promo card, storage box, and a mildly delusional sense of organization. I actually like this set for collectors who want more than just cards. It feels like a full-on project, and for $55, it’s one of the few Pokémon bundles that still comes close to feeling like it's worth the money.\nThis is the one I’d keep in my bag daily. It’s half an inch thick and can charge an iPhone 8 about 3.6 times or a Galaxy S22 almost twice. The USB-C port handles both input and output (a rarity at this price), and the dual USB-A ports mean you can charge multiple devices without carrying five bricks. It’s cheap, sleek, and has a literal paw print on it. Adorable and useful? Yes, please.\nI think this is the sweet spot if you bounce between devices. You get three outputs, including one that’ll fast-charge a MacBook Pro 14\" or your Steam Deck while you’re multitasking. There’s even a pop-out phone stand built in. It’s like if your power bank also respected your time and your binge-watching habits. At under $40, it feels like a steal.\nI picked up Death’s Door for five bucks and didn’t even hesitate. The Humble Store’s latest sale is packed with portable-friendly gems, perfect for a Steam Deck or travel laptop situation. Highlights include Dead Cells: Road to the Sea Bundle for $16.49 (50% off), Detroit: Become Human for just $11.99, and Dying Light Definitive Edition at $14.99. If your backlog needs more chaos, this is how you feed it on a budget.\nThis is my pick for weekend trips or carry-on duty. It’s got solid charging speed, a clean LED display that shows exactly how much juice is left, and enough capacity to last through a few full phone charges. It even handles smaller accessories like AirPods or smartwatches without flinching, which is more than I can say for some people.\nThis Gallica statue is up for preorder at $129.99, and yes, I want it just for the wings. It's 8.9 inches tall with glossy clear parts and Magla particles swirling on the base. The sculpt is absurdly detailed, which probably explains why I’ve already mentally cleared shelf space despite the fact it doesn't ship until November 2025. Patience is hard, but preorder now, panic later.\nIf I’m packing a laptop, a tablet, a phone, and something else probably unnecessary but still USB-powered, this is what I’m bringing. It hits 100W output, recharges itself fast via USB-C, and can handle charging multiple high-power devices at once. It’s a bit of a tank, but in the way you want when you're relying on it to keep everything alive.\nIf I had to pick a favorite just for everyday carry, it might be this one. It’s compact, fast, and charges three devices at once. I love the built-in phone stand, especially for killing time in waiting rooms or pretending I’m not watching TikTok in public. For $20, it’s a little charger that does a lot.\nI don’t need six booster packs, but these are usually in and out of stock. ThisSurging SparksBooster Bundle has some fantastic chase cards, we're talking $400+ chase cards that could be in this Booster Bundle. It’s under $50, which in Pokémon terms is basically a clearance sticker. I'm not saying it'll change your life, but it might improve your afternoon.\nThis is the TV I’d buy if I wanted something that works without having to pretend I care about specs. It turns on, the picture’s 4K, it has Alexa so I don’t have to get off the couch, and it costs less than my last grocery run. Honestly, that’s more than enough.\nI don’t usually gravitate toward games based on cartoons, but this bundle is stacked if you’ve got kids or just want a break from games that scream at you.Bluey, PAW Patrol, My Little Pony — the whole crew’s here, and honestly, they’re better made than half the AAA titles I’ve rage-quit. Pay $20 or more, get a pile of games, and support charity. Seems like a win for everyone except your free time.\nI like this one because it feels unnecessarily large in the best way. You get Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and it still costs less than a concert ticket and a hoodie. If you want to make movie night feel intentional without spending your life savings, this does the job.\nI want this on my shelf mostly so people ask what it is and I can pretend I understandDeath Stranding 2. It’s a 1/350 scale model of a massive mobile base from a game that hasn’t even released yet, and I respect the level of commitment required to care this much. It’s $69.99, which is fair for something this weirdly specific and detailed — and yes, the railgun is included.\nThis is the kind of TV I’d get if I wanted it to last longer than my attention span. It’s a 2024 model, has LG’s updated processor, and handles all the streaming stuff without having to download three extra apps just to log in. Feels like someone at LG actually thought it through.\nI think this is what happens when Samsung realizes not everyone wants to spend $650 to track their steps. The titanium build is overkill in a good way, and the battery life means I don’t have to charge it every time I blink. It finally dropped to a price where it makes sense to buy one without feeling like I’m auditioning for a tech influencer role.\ni’ve been watching theJourney TogetherElite Trainer Box like a hawk, and somehow it’s actually in stock at Amazon for $70.31. That’s 30% off apparantly, but it's not at all. It includes nine booster packs, a full-art N’s Zorua promo, sleeves, and the usual accessories, Most people just want the packs and the promo. If it’s gone when you check, keep trying. I’ve seen stock randomly reappear in the mornings and lunch time, just likeTarget's Journey Together stock.\nThen there’s the Paldean Fates Booster Bundle at $69.77. Six packs inside, and the draw here is the return of shiny Pokémon. I like that it cuts straight to the good stuff — no sleeves, no dice, no cardboard fluff, just a clean bundle of packs ready to be cracked open. If you’re chasing shinies, this is where the hunt begins.\nHumble Bundle’s “Best of Boomer Shooters 4” is live right now, and I love how chaotic it is. For $16, you get $174 worth of retro-inspired FPS games likeTurbo OverkillandForgive Me Father 2. I think of it as therapy, just with more blood and less talking about my feelings. You also support some good causes, so now your nostalgia trip is technically altruism. You're welcome.\nShrouded FableETB is holding steady at $54.96, and I think it’s slept on. It has nine packs, a Pecharunt foil, some sharp sleeves, and a player’s guide that you’ll absolutely ignore until you pull something weird and have to look it up. This set's all about the Legendary trio—Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti—and if you’re into building themed decks or hoarding off-meta cards, this one hits.\nFinally, if your card obsession extends beyond Pikachu, the Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors’ Dreams trading cards are now up for pre-order on the IGN Store, starting at $20. I already pre-ordered a box because the idea of serial-numbered Chun-Li cards is somehow more exciting to me than it should be. Rare pulls, killer art, and a chance to relive the 90s one Hadouken at a time — I’m in.\nI picked up one of the Paradox Clash tins just for fun and honestly, no regrets. For $39.96, you get five booster packs and either a Walking Wake EX or Iron Leaves EX promo, chosen completely at random. It’s a bit of a gamble, but opening tins is half the fun anyway. The promos are clean, the packaging is slick, and I think it makes a solid gift for anyone getting into the game\nFor a cheaper fix, I’d go for the $12.25 blister pack with three random boosters and a foil promo. It’s 39% off, which is honestly kind of wild, and it’s one of those no-risk purchases you can talk yourself into without too much guilt. The listing shows Silver Tempest Boosters, so there's a good chance of pulling some Sword and Shield chase cards here.This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

The biggest deal available is 32% off theGalaxy Z Fold 6, which is a great choice if you're interested in one of Samsung's folding phones. TheZ Flip 6is also $300 off, and you can even save on the recent S25+ orS25 Ultra. Overall, you're saving at least $300 across the board, regardless of which phone you may choose.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Reviewby Mark Knapp\n\"The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is an incredibly versatile, elegant, and powerful phone. It should stand out as the best Samsung has to offer, but after years of iteration on this device and a price tag that sets it certainly above many of its competitors (except Apple), the Galaxy S25 Ultra frequently had me asking, “is this the best Samsung can do?” Samsung’s displays, once the best, now have little to stand out from the many excellent competitors. The phone’s performance may top the charts briefly, but quickly sinks below the competition in sustained usage. And even the technically impressive cameras fail to offer the character that might make them lovable. Samsung really needed near-perfection this year, and all it delivered was greatness.\"\nNext, Samsung has discounted various 4K TVs, like The Frame series or the75\" QN90D. These are all quality models that act as a perfect upgrade to any living room, bedroom, or media room. There's also savings on various Q-Series soundbars, which are essential for the besthome theater experience. You can even save $200 off The Freestyle, an all-in-oneprojectorthat can create a huge image while outputting 360-degree sound.\nSamsung has discounted both Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 7 models, which makes today the perfect time to upgrade if you're still using an older model. The newer Galaxy Watch 7 brought improved sensors, battery life, and more. We have it ranked asthe best Android smartwatch out there. Additionally, both Galaxy Buds 3 andGalaxy Buds 3 Proare excellent earbuds for Android users. While the battery life can be less than ideal at times, we still found the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to be great inour 8/10 review.\nFinally, there are many different deals on gaming monitors, memory cards, and storage options. Our favorite deal is 51% off the 34\" Odyssey QD-OLED G8, as this deal includes a 32\" ViewFinity S7 (S70D)4K UHD Monitorfree of charge. It's hard to beat two monitors for the price of one. You'll also find quality savings on other Odyssey models, like the Neo G8 which has a 4K UHD display and a 240Hz refresh rate. As for storage, the Pro Plus Sonic the Hedgehog 512GB microSD card is on sale for $44.99, and you can save $70 off this 4TB NVMe SSDthat is compatible with PS5.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "title": "Mortal Kombat 1’s T-1000 Packs 3 Terminator 2 References Into One Fatality",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-11T13:59:13Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-t-1000-packs-3-terminator-2-references-into-one-fatality",
    "full_text": "Mortal Kombat 1 developer NetherRealm has revealed a detailed look at T-1000 gameplay, and a look at a new Fatality packed with references to Terminator 2.\n\nIn the video, below, we see the T-1000 use various liquid metal abilities to move about the screen, absorb hits, and poke at his enemies. Even shapeshifting sorcerer Shang Tsung praises the T-1000’s abilities during one pre-match trash talk cutscene.\nThe highlight of the video is the look at one of the T-1000’s Fatalities, which includes three references to Terminator 2. The first is the iconic finger point through the eyeball, the second the arm blade through the mouth, then the elevator door parting, except through the T-1000’s foe’s torso. Its animality sees the T-1000 transform into a K-9 German Shepherd, another reference to Terminator 2. In the film, John Connor's foster parents owned a German Shepherd named Max. The Terminator calls the dog Wolfie to trick the T-1000.\nThe T-1000 in Mortal Kombat 1 is of course based on the liquid metal-based cybernetic assassin from the 1991 blockbuster Terminator 2: Judgment Day film, and features the voice and likeness of actor Robert Patrick.\nHere’s the official blurb on the T-1000 from NetherRealm:\nThe T-1000 Terminator joins the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on March 18 as part of the early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners, followed by wide availability for purchase on March 25.\nMeanwhile, we get another look at the upcoming Kameo character Madame Bo. In the trailer we see her Fatal Blow, a move in which she batters her enemy’s face with her slipper. Madam Bo will be available as a content update for all Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns owners at no additional cost or via standalone purchase on March 18.\nT-1000 is the final DLC character set to be added to the 5 million-selling Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s success.\nParent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things,the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat.\nIn September, Mortal Kombat development chiefEd Boon said NetherRealm had decided on its next game three years prior, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”\nMost fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series,Injustice: Gods Among Us, launched in 2013, with its sequel,Injustice 2, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm releasedMortal Kombat 11in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.\nInan interview with IGNin June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. \"There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't,\" Boon said.\nTwo reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).\n\"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal,\" Boon said. \"We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' \"\nJust to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.\n\"Not at all,\" Boon answered.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "title": "UK Deals: I'm Going To Complete My Paldean Fates Baby Shiny Collection Thanks To This Restock",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-08T13:00:20Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-deals-im-going-to-complete-my-paldean-fates-baby-shiny-collection-thanks-to-this-restock",
    "full_text": "As of March 8, the Pokémon TCG: Scarlet & Violet—Paldean Fates Premium Collection is back in stock at Amazon for around £50. This set includes eight booster packs, three etched foil promo cards, and an oversized Quaquaval ex, but the real draw is what could be inside those packs. Paldean Fates has some of the most valuable Shiny Pokémon cards we’ve had for a while.\n\nPaldean Fates follows the trend of special sets featuring Shiny Pokémon reprints, much like Hidden Fates and Shining Fates. Those sets became nearly impossible to find at retail after a few months, and this one is on the same path. It’s packed with rare and playable cards, so collectors and competitive players are snapping up packs fast. Unlike regular sets, Paldean Fates guarantees at least one Shiny Pokémon every three packs on average, making it one of the more rewarding sets to open.\nThe biggest chase card in the set is Charizard ex (Special Illustration Rare), currently selling for over £200. Charizard cards always hold value and are usually playable, making them even more desirable. The stunning artwork features Shiny Charizard in Dragon Tera form, making it a must-have for collectors. If past Charizard chase cards are anything to go by, this one isn’t going to drop in price anytime soon.\nRight behind it is Mew ex (Special Illustration Rare), which is going for over £350. Known as \"Bubble Mew\", this card stands out for its unique, stylized artwork that makes it look completely different from any Mew card before it. It’s not just collectors driving up the price. The card is playable and highly sought after for competitive decks, making it one of the most valuable pulls in the entire set.\nGardevoir ex (Special Illustration Rare) is another high-value card, selling for close to £100. This version had big expectations after the Scarlet & Violet base set’s Gardevoir ex Special Illustration Rares, but it delivers with a softer, dreamlike art style. Gardevoir has always been a fan favorite, so it’s no surprise that this card is among the most expensive in Paldean Fates.\nIf you’re after classic Pokémon, the Shiny Rare Pikachu is one of the hardest to find. Despite being the same rarity as other Shiny Pokémon, its £40+ price tag proves just how much collectors want it. Pikachu cards are usually easy to find (Bar Surging Sparks of course), but this one is different. It’s part of the Shiny Vault subset, which means there’s a huge pool of possible pulls, making it tough to track down.\nIono (Special Illustration Rare) is one of the best Trainer cards in the set and is selling for over £35. It’s one of the most playable supporter cards in the game, meaning players need multiple copies, and this version has incredible alternate artwork. It was the most expensive card in the Japanese version of the set, and while it’s not quite at that level in English, it’s still one of the best pulls you can get.\nThere’s also strong demand for Shiny Charmander and Charmeleon because no one wants an incomplete evolution line. Charmander is selling for over £25, and Charmeleon is around £15-£20, mostly because players want them to go alongside Shiny Charizard ex. These are the kinds of cards that only become harder to find over time, especially as more people complete their collections.\nPaldean Fates has solid pull rates, making it one of the better sets to open if you’re hoping to find something valuable. Shiny Pokémon show up about once every three packs, and there’s a real chance of hitting a Special Illustration Rare or Hyper Rare every 50 to 60 packs. While that might sound like a long shot, it’s far better than what we’ve seen in some past special sets likePrismatic EvolutionsandShrouded Fable. Every pack feels like it has potential, which makes it easy to keep opening more.\nChristian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

    "full_text": "Deep discounts can be found on tons of thebest PlayStation Portal accessoriesthanks toAmazon’s Big Spring Sale, and today is the final day to save. From cases and screen protectors to docks and headphones, these items either enhance your playing experience or help protect Sony’s remote player. Right now, many accessories are 10% to over 40% off, bringing the lowest prices of 2025 so far. Chances are good you won’t see savings like these for at least another few months, so now is the time to buy.\n\nSure, thePlayStation Portalmay not be as portable as the name suggests, as it relies on a strong Wi-Fi signal to stream games. Still, if you’ve got a good connection, you can take the device just about anywhere. Plus, thePlayStation Portal now supports cloud gamingvia a PlayStation Plus subscription, so a PS5 is no longer required to play.\nIf you’ve been hesitant to buy the gaming handheld in the past, this added functionality brings more value. You can evengrab the PlayStation Portal in a new Midnight Blackcolorway, and then be sure to get some discounted accessories to go with it, since only a USB-C to USB-C charging cable comes in the box.\nWith a large and sharp 8-inch LCD screen and Dual Sense style controls, the PS Portal is susceptible to damage. An accidental drop or too much pressure in a bag could end up bricking the pricey remote player, making a case a high priority.\nOrzly’s caseis one of thebest PlayStation Portal casesyou can grab. It perfectly matches the device’s dimensions for a snug fit, offers a padded section for accessories, and comes with a hard shell for extra protection, and the case is $15 off during Amazon’s sale. Want something a little less expensive? There’s a great deal at the moment on a durablecase from FYOUNGwith similar features to the Orzly case. If you need something extra tough, theSTARTRC GAMES Carrying Caseis designed to take on a little more wear and tear than your average hard shell case. It’s also on sale.\nA zippered hard shell case won’t protect the PlayStation Portal when you’re actually playing a game. So, those with butter fingers might want to consider some additional protection. A screen protector is a great way to prevent cracks to the precious display when the device falls from your grip, and our favoritetwo-pack of screen protectors from ivolerhappens to be a part of Amazon’s sale. Speaking of grip, a form-fitting case, likethis discounted option from Qoosea, gives you a better handle on the device while wrapping it with an extra layer of protection against scratches, dust, and more.\nRather than buying each accessory individually to keep the PlayStation Portal safe in various situations, plenty of accessory sets are on sale during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. These kits come with a hard shell case for travel and storage, a form-fitting cover for protection while you play, and screen protectors to keep scratches to the screen at bay. Some go even further, offering thumbstick covers and extra space for SD cards, cords, and more.\nWhile most PlayStation Portal accessories focus on protection, a couple others are worth the investment to make life with the device even better.\nYou'll want a pair ofgreat gaming earbudsto keep games distraction free, andTurtle Beach’s Battle Budsare currently discounted. Yes, these are wired because the PlayStation Portal does not support Bluetooth audio. Wireless headsets require PlayStation Link support. Unfortunately, we’re not seeing any major discounts on the few options that do offer PlayStation’s proprietary wireless.\nA charging dock is another sound purchase, as you’ll need something to top up the remote player after its 7 to 9 hours of battery life runs out. A charging dock provides a secure place to store your device as it charges. Our favorite charging dock, theFYoung Charging Dock Stationis on sale, and beyond charging the Portal in 3.5 hours, it adds some visual flair to your space with 14 customizable color options. Asimilar option from LVVILis also on sale.\nDanielle is a Tech freelance writer based in Los Angeles who spends her free time creating videos and geeking out over music history."

    "publishedAt": "2025-03-22T13:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/how-severance-employs-the-uncanny-valley",
    "full_text": "\nThere’s something uncanny about the office.\nIt has furniture and lights and doors, but nothing you would ever put in your own house. You eat in a little room they tell you to, wear drab office clothes and make cordial office friends. It’syou, but it’s not yourlife.It just kind of feels that way sometimes. A drop-shipped dupe of the designer handbag that is the human experience.\nSeverance is a show that explores the outer limits of this artificiality.It’s a paranoid Philip K. Dick mind-melterin a prestige TV package, exploring the unsettling otherness of an office setting that’s just slightly outside the bounds of reality.\nMany of us have little choice but to spend much of our short time on earth existing in an office, which means we’re about as familiar with the look and feel of the space as we are with our own faces. When things are even just a little, tiny bit off, we notice. That’s the theory behind the “uncanny valley,” the idea that the closer humanoid robots look to real people, the more that subtle, slightly-askew differences will make them exponentially more freaky.\nIf a robot is a cartoony abstraction like Bender Rodriguez, people are totally fine with it. But if you deck him out in some fake skin over a highly articulated endoskeleton, ourmonkey-brain “flight” responsescan’t help but kick in. It’s how our brains evolved to perceive things, possibly to prevent us mingling with other early hominids.\nThinkDisney’s Hall of Presidents, or all thoseandroid girlfriendson display at CES. The more something resembles the real thing, the more that small, almost imperceivable differences matter. Achieving perfection is essentially the only antidote to this phenomenon.\nThe uncanny valley is what makes the CG animation of Bob Zemeckis movies so skin-crawling. It’s why we cringed through Mass Effect: Andromeda. The reason AI generated babies raise instinctual alarm bells. When something is notquiteright, it can feelverywrong.\nIn Severance, Lumon Headquarters is located in a fake town called Kier in a fake state called PE situated deep within the uncanny valley. The facility features sprawling, identical hallways of impeccably sterile decor. Dozens of meticulously labelled doors that can lead anywhere from a cookie-cutter conference room to a deranged faction of goat-keepers.\nLumon isn’t the workplace we know, it’s the one we visit in our nightmares, the mundane ones where you completely forgot about a project you were supposed to be working on for months and it’s dueright now. It’s a dreamlike space of fuzzy details and a barely-audible buzzing of dread.\nSeverance is heavily informed by the aesthetic of “liminal spaces,” impossibly vast, eerily familiar environments designed to instill a sense of dread and confusion. Imagine a dead mall that sprawls on for infinity, or a surreal fast food playplace with slides that don’t end and ball pits that are deeper than the diameter of the planet.\nLiminal spaces came to prominence thanks to the spread of the Backrooms, acreepypasta that first appeared on 4chanback in 2019. “In the Backrooms,” wrote the surprisingly eloquent poster who will forever remain anon, there’s “nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in.”\nThe Backrooms is a true internet original,a memetic masterpiece that belongs to no one and every one. It spawned a series of short films,countless streamer-bait jump scare gameson Steam, and, soon, a major motion picture from A24.Severance creator Dan Erickson citedThe Backrooms, as well as its video game predecessor The Stanley Parable, as one of many inspirations for the show’s dreamlike unreality.\nHe also named The Matrix, The Truman Show, and Dark City, films featuring characters who realize they are trapped in an obscene simulacrum of life, manipulated by powerful forces beyond their control or understanding. Even before our naive heroes learn the truth, they begin their journey by seeing the slight cracks in the seemingly perfect facades around them– enlightenment achieved by way of the uncanny valley effect.\nThe notion ofawakening from a constructed realityruns deep within Severance, not only thematically but aesthetically. The Truman Show, in particular, with its deliberately anachronistic clockwork world, seems to inform the show's interpretation of the timeless essence of the office.\nLumon’s design language isn't a pastiche of any particular era, though the earth tone interiors and Brutalist tech evoke the ugly interiors of the ‘60s and ‘70s. The severed floor exists outside of any specific time or place the same way its employees exist outside of their real lives. It’s a boiled-down, hyperreal, evocative impression of what a workplace is.It’s not the office, it’s Officecore.\nThere’s been copious discussion about how Season 2 of Severance doesn’t quite live up to the high bar set by its predecessor. Some attribute that to unsatisfying follow-ups to the first season’s revelations. Others might point to a ramping up of the mystery box-ification that has plagued buzzworthy TV shows since Lost.\nFor myself, I’ve found the show slightly less interesting since it shifted its focus away from the workplace. Outdoor team-building exercises, diversions to hellish hometowns, and an increased emphasis on the outside world has diminished what made the show so special in the first place: the unsettling excursion into the uncanny valley of our artificial office lives."

    "title": "Nintendo Switch 2: 23 New Details - Release Date, Price, GameChat and More!",

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-23-new-details-release-date-price-gamechat-and-more",
    "full_text": "There was aton of new info to take in from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. Luckily, we’ve picked out the most important details about the console, including when you can play it and the technology behind it, in this handy article. So, let’s get straight to it. Here are 23 new details about the Switch 2 console and its new GameChat feature.\n\n1. Let’s start with the big one. We finally now know that theNintendo Switch 2 will arrive on June 5th, 2025.\n2. It will beavailable to pre-orderon April 8th in the UK and Europe, but one day later on the 9th in the US.\n3. The Switch 2 is a larger version of the original hybrid console, with the screen measuring 7.9 inches – a considerable increase compared to the Switch’s 6.2 inches.\n4. The screen itself is a 1080p LCD monitor, with double the amount of pixels of the original screen. It also supports HDR (High Definition Range) and 120fps for an even smoother gameplay experience.\n5.4K resolution will be available on Switch 2 when dockedand a suitable TV is connected via HDMI. The new dock also has a built-in fan this time around.\n6. The Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage, a mammoth eight times the amount of space the original came with.\n7. If you simply have too many games and need even more room, MicroSD Express cards are the only type that can be inserted for extra storage. Frustratingly, original Switch microSDs won’t work.\n8.The Switch 2 will also be using a new type of game card. They’re red as opposed to their predecessor’s grey, and have a faster reading speed.\n9. The audio capabilities of the Switch 2 appear significantly improved, with better quality speakers allowing for increased range, as well as 3D audio available when using headphones. Great, now we’ll be able to hear that blue shell coming for us directly from behind.\n10. There’s also a built-in microphone on the top of the console that comes into its own when using the Switch 2’s brand-new GameChat feature (more on that later).\n11. It also possesses two USB C ports. One on the bottom, just like the original Switch, and one on top to make charging easier when in tabletop mode, or if you want to take advantage of the new Nintendo Switch Camera 2 accessory.\n12. The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera will be available on the same day as the console. It will cost  $49.99/£49.99 and can be used to put your face into games, such as Mario Party Jamboree, or as an overlay when playing with friends.\n13. The Switch 2 joy-con connects magnetically to the console via the bigger, metallic SL and SR buttons, and also has larger analog sticks.\n14.Each joy-con can also be used as a mouse too. Some examples of games that have were shown to use this functionality are Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Civilization 7.\n15. A new Pro Controller will also be available for the Switch 2. It comes with programmable GL and GR buttons on the grips and will be available for $79.99/£74.99.\n16. Other official accessories revealed at this time include Mario Kart steering wheels, a Switch 2 carry case, and an “all in one” carry case that can store and carry all equipment needed to play in TV mode. This includes the Nintendo Switch 2 system, Nintendo Switch 2 dock, Joy-Con 2 controllers, various cables, and up to six game cards.\n17. Amiibo also make their return and are confirmed to be compatible with the Switch 2. Three new Street Fighter Amiibo – Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly – are due at the console’s launch.\n18.The standard Nintendo Switch 2 console costs $449.99/£395.99and comes with the following in its box: A Nintendo Switch 2 console, Joy-Con 2 controllers (L+R), Joy-Con 2 Grip, Joy-Con 2 Straps, Nintendo Switch 2 Dock, Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable, Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter, and a USB-C Charging Cable.\n19. A Mario Kart World Bundle will also be available at launch. It comes with all of the above, plus a copy of the game. This will cost $499.99/£429.99.\n20. And finally, the big mystery of the Switch 2’s C button was finally solved.GameChat is a new party voice channel systemfor the Nintendo console that will allow players to talk to friends, and all begins with a press of that button.\n21. The microphone on the top of the console promises to pick up players’ voices over the top of background noise, whether be busy traffic or a vacuum cleaner on the other side of the room.\n22. It will also allow players to share their screens with others, much like PlayStation’s share screen tech, so that you can see what your friends are up to or even help them with a particular puzzle.\n23. GameChat, of course, comes with a price, though. And that admission fee is a Nintendo Online membership. That will only be the case after March 31st, 2026, however, as before then it will be available to all Switch 2 owners for free.\nAnd that’s all the quickfire information we picked out from Nintendo’s extensive Switch 2 Direct. Are you planning on picking up a Switch 2 at launch? Let us know in the comments. And for everything else Switch 2, stick with IGN.\nSimon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.
