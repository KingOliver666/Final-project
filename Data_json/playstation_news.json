    "full_text": "Speculation thatStarfieldwill soon be confirmed for release on PlayStation 5 ramped up over the weekend after fans spotted a PlayStation logo on Bethesda’s official Creations website.\n\nThe logo was attached to a work-in-progress ship decals Creation for Starfield, and although the Creation was removed, fans are speculating that Bethesda’s so-far PC and Xbox-only sci-fi game is soon set for PS5.\nThoughts inevitably turn to whether Bethesda plans a significant content update, possibly even a new expansion, to coincide with Starfield’s seemingly inevitable release on PS5. There’s been little to shout about when it comes to Starfield in recent months, following the launch of the poorly receivedShattered Space expansion. Bethesda parent company Microsoft is expected to hold another summer showcase this year, as it has done in recent years, and that event may be the right time and place to learn more about all things Starfield.\nBethesda itself has said it has \"exciting things\" planned for Starfield this year, amid growing discontent from players about a lack of communication and updates. In June 2024,Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supportingStarfield, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. In an interview withYouTube channel MrMattyPlays, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”\nStarfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new intellectual property in years, and its first mainline single-player game since Microsoft bought parent company ZeniMax Media in March 2021. IGN’sStarfield reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist.”\nIn January,Microsoft’s gaming boss Phil Spencer refused to rule out Starfield coming out on PS5.Starfield and MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were both reported as being considered for PS5 as far back as March 2024. Indy ended up confirmed for PS5 with a spring 2025 release window, a few months after its release on PC and Xbox Series X and S. But Starfield is yet to be confirmed for PS5, although Spencer's comments certainly suggested it was on the cards.\nA number of Xbox games are currently available on PS5, including Rare’s Sea of Thieves, Tango Gameworks’ Hi-Fi Rush, and Obsidian’s Grounded and Pentiment. Microsoft already publishes Minecraft games on PlayStation consoles, among many other platforms, and is set to publish Doom: The Dark Ages and Ninja Gaiden 4 on PS5 later this year. Playground’s Forza Horizon 5 is also confirmed as coming to PS5 soon. There are even reports thatMicrosoft is finally ready to release Halo on PlayStation after decades of Xbox exclusivity.\nSpencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.\n“We run a business,”Spencer said in August last year. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.\n“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”\nIt’s a busy time for the 450-person Bethesda Game Studios, which currently operates five teams: Starfield; Elder Scrolls 6; Fallout 76; mobile; and external development partnerships.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "full_text": "Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition has hit its lowest price yet,now available for $49.99 at Amazon—its best deal to date, even beating Black Friday, according to our records, and even price-tracking siteCamelCamelCamel.\n\nOriginally released on October 8 forNintendo SwitchandPlayStation 4 (fully compatible with PS5), this collection brings together the first six mainline Final Fantasy games in their carefully remastered form. Square Enix has opted for refinement rather than reinvention, keeping the original pixelated aesthetic intact but sharpening it for modern displays.\nThe result is a collection that looks fantastic, whether on a massive TV or in handheld mode. The soundtrack has also received an orchestral upgrade, with legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu overseeing the new arrangements. On top of that, the package introduces a handful of thoughtful quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to disable random encounters and boost experience and gil gains—useful for those who want to focus on the story without the grind.\nAs a small but nostalgic extra, this edition includes a sticker sheet featuring 12 classic character sprites, including the Black Mage, a Moogle, Terra, Kain, and a mid-cackle Kefka. It’s not the most extravagant of bonuses, but it’s a fun little touch for fans of the series.\nAt its original $74.99 price, the collection was a tougher sell, but at $49.99, it's a much easier recommendation for anyone interested in the series’ origins. Whether you’re revisiting these classics or playing them for the first time, this is a well-executed remaster of six of themost influential RPGsever made. And with physical copies being the only collectible edition available, it might be worth picking up before they become harder to find, especially at this time.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "full_text": "One of the biggest barriers to jumping into the current generation for PlayStation players has been the rising cost of living, squeezing wallets so tight that there's sadly been no room for a PS5 in the budget.\n\nIn 2025, however, PlayStation has three new ways that get a new PS5 for less: an almost£110-saving Astro Bot Bundle, an added£50 bonus when trading in a PS4, or ahassle-free leasing option with low monthly payments. Scoring a PS5, my friend, is easier than ever right now.\nEditor's Note: Brought to you in partnership with PlayStation.\nFor those almost ready to pull the trigger on buying a PlayStation 5, but have been waiting for a price drop, buying the Astro Bot bundle is the best way to get on board in more ways than one.\nThe bundle comes in two forms: you can either buy aPS5 Slim (with disc drive) & Astro Bot for £429.99or purchase aDigital Edition PS5 Slim with Astro Bot for £339.99.\nWhichever you go for, those prices are £109.99 lower than if you bought each console and the game individually, which you can put towards more games, another DualSense controller, or leave nestled safely in your savings account.\nThe delightfully beloved platformer that won Game of the Year at the Game Awards 2024,Astro Botis arguably one of the best titles to have bundled with a new console if you haven't had the chance to play it yet.\nSince it's a PEGI 7-rated celebration of PlayStation's history & a fun adventure in its own right, it's one of the finest for any gaming household, whether to play yourself or with the children in your family.\nAlthough trading in your PS4 to put towards a PS5 or PS5 Pro has been an option already, PlayStation is offering an extra £50 on top of what you would normally get for your old console, going as high as £150.\nAtPlayStation's Trade-In hub page, you can quickly get your PS4 evaluated, ship your console over free of charge, and receive an added £50 voucher along with what you would get for the trade-in as standard.\nFor example, you could get £100 for a PS4 Pro in good condition and £50 with the trade-up voucher, totalling £150 off a £339.99 PS5 Digital Console & Astro Bot bundle, leaving you with only £189.99 left to pay for your shiny new PlayStation 5 console and added game to get you started.\nIf you already have a PS5, but your old PS4 has since been going unused and gathering dust, you can still send in your PlayStation 4 in and put your boosted trade-in money towards a PS VR2 headset—so you can jump into exclusive games likeHorizon Call of the Mountainfor a more affordable price.\nFor you who want to dive into the PS5 ecosystem but don't have the immediate funds to do so, PlayStation Flex is the console-maker's new interesting way to add a PS5 to your home for as low as a mere £10.99 a month.\nThis is thanks to PlayStation UK's new partnership with Raylo, a top tech leasing service that has been on the service and earning high Trustpilot reviews since 2019.\nThrough the newPlayStation Flex pagepowered by Raylo, you can effectively set up a rental agreement and have a PS5 Pro, PS5 Slim, or PS5 Digital Edition delivered to your door. Including those consoles, you can also lease a PSVR 2 and some accessories too:\nYou can choose a 36-, 24-, 12- or rolling monthly lease with payments being lower the longer you sign up for. No matter which way, PlayStation Flex can make for a quick and easy barrier to entry to start your PS5 journey.\nBen Williams– IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

    "full_text": "Fans quick to celebrate the reveal of a Microsoft Flight Simulator PlayStation Store page were left let down after it was discovered that the actual product is little more than “copycat shovelware.”\n\nXbox and PlayStation fans gathered to discuss a potential port for the popular flight simulation game afterReddit user CreativeRaspberry314 sharedTrophy information related to a potential PS4 and PS5 version earlier today. It would be exciting – ifnot somewhat unsurprising– to see Microsoft bring more Xbox titles to PlayStation fans, butthe spotted store pageisn’t officially related to Microsoft Flight Simulator in any way, shape, or form.\n“Sadly, this is just a copycat shovelware game,” oneReddit user added. “Straight up shovelware,” anotheradded. “Actually mental tbh, the picture is a straight up rip-off. If it was MSFS, it'd have the same achievements as the Xbox/Steam versions.”\nInstead, the Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation is being published by a company named Grizzly Games Limited. As spotted byEurogamer, the company shares a name with Thronefall developer Grizzly Games but is also completely unrelated to that entity. While that team is responsible for other titles like Superflight and Islanders, theGrizzly Games Limited websitereveals a catalog of what appear to be mobile games featuring glossy, AI-generated materials. The art for its Flight Simulator 2025 project also appears to be generated by AI judging by some of its muddy plane parts and strange designs.\nThe Thronefall team, meanwhile, provided a statement to Eurogamer related to the discovery of Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation and Grizzly Games Limited. Grizzly Games says it is not associated with the company, adding that it is using “both our name and logo illegally.”\n“Furthermore they seem to incorporate the absolute opposite of our values, of what we stand for and what we’re trying to give to the gaming community,” Grizzly Games continued. “Unfortunately our legal resources are limited as a two-person indie team, but honestly I'd love to see this kind of stuff being stopped, especially since it's not only happening to us but lots of indie devs that just lack the legal power.\"\nAs of this story’s publication, the Flight Simulator 2025 page remains live on the PlayStation Store. It describes an experience that “sets a new standard in aviation simulation, combining ultra-realistic flight dynamics with breathtaking visuals.” No gameplay for the project has been revealed.\n“Can shovelware just be banned from the store please? It’s packed to the brim with it and makes browsing an absolute chore,” anotherReddit user added. “I don’t remember it being this bad in prior generations.”\nPlayStationtook a standagainst what many refer to as “spam” titles in 2022. At the time, it was believed the move was made to fight back against easy-to-Platinum games, or titles that exist almost solely for the purpose of increasing players’ Platinum Trophy count. However, many shovelware titles still exist on the PlayStation Store andother digital storefrontstoday.\nWebrought a magnifying glass up to the issue last monthto take a closer look at how shovelware titles impact both gamers and developers. We spoke to multiple developers to learn more about not only how these games find their way onto digital storefronts but PlayStation, Nintendo, Xbox, and Valve’s vetting process.\nMichael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

    "full_text": "The most surprising reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct might have been a third-party game. Announced near the end of the showcase, FromSoftware is developing a brand-new game calledThe Duskbloods, which has some striking similarities to the beloved PlayStation 4-exclusive Bloodborne.\n\nThe Duskbloods is a new game, to be clear, set to arrive sometime in 2026 worldwide, and exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2. Playing as the \"Bloodsworn,\" a group that has gone beyond humanity thanks to special blood, players will enter a violent melee to become the \"First Blood.\"\nConfirmed in a press release from FromSoftware, The Duskbloods is a PvPvE title with \"online multiplayer at its core,\" with up to eight players battling for the win among themselves. So while all the blood, guns, and machinery brings to mind Bloodborne, it may also have quite a bit in common with the upcomingElden Ring Nightreign, though with some PvP rather than solely co-op PvE.\nWe didn't get much more than that, besides cryptic teases and some looks at some horrifying beasts and bosses. Still, Bloodborne fans are having a wide variety of reactions to this.\n\"BLOOD! EVERY FIVE SECONDS THEY TALKED ABOUT BLOOD!\" saidone commenter in the r/Bloodborne post about The Duskbloods on Reddit. Another said: \"That game is 100% Bloodborne 2. I assume the name change is either because it's in a different setting, or because of Sony exclusivity.\"\nThough The Duskbloods is still different, it's easy to see the connections that would have fans feeling like it's a spiritual sucessor to Bloodborne. And while the Souls games and Elden Ring have gone onto other systems — Elden Ring even got aTarnished Edition locked in for the Switch 2— Bloodborne has remained a PlayStation 4 exclusive since release, not even making it over to PC. A port, sequel, or really anything has been something fans have wanted for years.\n\"Nintendo really got tired of waiting for Bloodborne 2 and just decided to fund it themselves,\" anothercommenter said. Another reply points out that, much like Bloodborne, The Duskbloods is currently a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. \"Bloodborne was always an exclusive, this is on brand,\" areplier added.\nThe announcement definitely kick-started the Bloodborne faithful, though reality has been setting in with confirmation that this sounds like a battle royale-style game, rather than a single-player RPG you'd normally expect from FromSoftware.\nSome commenters startedexpressing dulled excitementover the revelation that The Duskbloods is a PvPvE experience. Threads have sprung up of fans finding this out, only to then express that between a multiplayer focus and Switch 2 exclusivity, they might not be so eager to jump on for The Duskbloods.\nWe're due to learn more about The Duskbloods soon, as Nintendo will post an interview with director Hidetaka Miyazaki on its website on April 4. Presumably this will shed some light on how exactly The Duskbloods will work, what its PvPvE will look like, and whether this can truly be enough to sate the Bloodborne fans who've been holding out hope for so long.\nFor all the other news announced during today's stream, be sure tocheck out our recap of everything announced at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.\nEric is a freelance writer for IGN."

    "full_text": "Bloodborneturns 10 years old today, and fans are celebrating by organizing yet another return to Yharnam community event.\n\nFromSoftware’s PlayStation 4 masterpiece launched on March 24, 2015, and helped cement the Japanese developer as one of the greatest of our time. Critical and commercial acclaim followed, and a follow-up in the vein of the Dark Souls sequels seemed inevitable.\nBut since then… nothing. Why hasn’t Sony followed upBloodbornewith either a current-gen remaster, a full-on sequel, or at the very least a next-gen update that would finally make it officially playable in 60fps? Fans have begged Sony for more Bloodborne ever since it came out. The deafening silence in response remains one of the most puzzling business decisions in all video games.\nEarlier this year, we got an explanation of sorts. Following his exit from Sony,PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida revealed his Bloodborne no-show theory. To be clear up front: this is Yoshida’s opinion, which inan interview with Kinda Funny Gameshe stressed was not inside information, or the reveal of the current deliberations within the bowels of Sony itself.\n“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida said. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.\n“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”\nMiyazaki-san is of course Hidetaka Miyazaki, the boss of FromSoftware. And yes, he’s incredibly successful. Not only for the influential Dark Souls series, but, most recently, the mainstream hitElden Ring, which propelled FromSoftware to new heights. So much so thatit’s getting a multiplayer spin-off this year.\nAnd it seems obvious to say Miyazaki will be incredibly busy with multiple projects to direct and a company to run. After Bloodborne came out in 2015, Miyazaki directedDark Souls 3, then 2019’sSekiro: Shadows Die Twicefor Activision, then the aforementioned Elden Ring for Bandai Namco. What's next? Miyazaki has yet to say.\nIn interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year,Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware.\nIn the years since, modders have tried to fill the gaps with fan-made projects that improve upon the base PS4 Bloodborne experience. But Sony has taken a dim view.Well-known Bloodborne 60fps mod creator Lance McDonald announced in Januarythat he’d received a takedown notification on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment “asking that I remove links to the patch I posted on the internet, so I've now done so.” The DMCA takedown arrived four years after the mod was released.\nThen, just a week later, Lilith Walther,creator ofNightmare Kart, which was previously known asBloodborne Kart, and the eye-catching Bloodborne PSX demake, tweeted to say an old YouTube video of the demake was hit with a copyright claim.\nRecently, fans managed to get PS4 emulators to deliver something akin to a remaster on PC. The tech experts atDigital Foundry released a videocovering “a breakthrough in PS4 emulation” via ShadPS4, which means Bloodborne is now fully playable start to finish in 60fps. Could this breakthrough have triggered an aggressive response from Sony? IGN asked Sony for comment at the time, but it has yet to respond.\nThat’s all we have to go on, really, which leaves Bloodborne fans to take it upon themselves to organize Return to Yharnam community events.Another kicks off today, on Bloodborne’s 10th anniversary, and calls on fans to create a new character, and summon as many random cooperators and invaders as possible, and leave in-game messages flagging they’re a part of this latest community drive.\nPerhaps this will be all that’s left for fans to do in the world of Bloodborne forever more.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "full_text": "Sony and game developer Santa Monica Studio have revealed the Dark Odyssey collection, aGod of War Ragnarökupdate coming to players next week that features in-game equipment themed after one of the franchise's most iconic outfits.\n\nSony detailed all of the goodies included in its God of War 20th anniversary plans in aPlayStation.Blog post. Dark Odyssey is the real headline here, as it includes a war chest of cosmetic treats for all God of War Ragnarök owners across PlayStation 5 and PC. It’ll arrive as a free update March 20.\nEverything included in Dark Odyssey features a clean, black-and-gold look that will no doubt have Kratos and co looking better than ever as they tear their way through Norse mythology. Atreus and Freya both receive their own cosmetic sets as part of the patch, too, as do a variety of the player’s shields and weapons.\nThe show-stealer, though, is a Dark Odyssey appearance and armor set for Kratos that hearkens back to a skin originally only rewarded to players who managed to beat God of War 2 on God Mode difficulty. Players can claim the content in any Lost Items chest in the base game or immediately in God of War Ragnarök’s roguelike Valhalla mode after the update drops. The patch will also finally introduce the option to customize the appearance of Kratos’ weapons without sacrificing each weapon’s respective ability.\nDark Odyssey Armor & Appearance for Kratos\nDark Odyssey Companion Armor\nDark Odyssey Weapon Appearances & Attachments\nDark Odyssey Shield Appearances & Rönd\nGod of War Ragnarök released in late 2022, so one simple update was never going to do the series’ 20-year history justice. Also included in Sony’s plans to celebrate God of War is a long list of other activities and offers for those who have stuck with Kratos’ story since the beginning. Highlights include a collection of some snazzy social media assets (that you can downloadhere), an art showcase coming as part ofa collaboration with Los Angeles’ Gallery Nucleus, new merch, sales, multiple vinyl releases covering the franchise’s history, and more.

    "full_text": "There is enormous pressure onAssassin's Creed Shadowsto do well for Ubisoft globally after a number of delays and the sales failure of last year’sStar Wars Outlaws. Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number ofhigh-profile flops,layoffs,studio closures, andgame cancellationsin the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release.\n\nThings have got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family isreportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investorson a buyout deal that would let it preserve control of the company's intellectual property.\nSo, the video game world is watching Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ early performance closely for signs of its success — or failure. So far, Ubisoft has yet to announce a sales figure, but has saidAssassin's Creed Shadows hit 2 million players just two days after launch, surpassing the launches of both Origins and Odyssey.\nThere’s also a lot of attention on Shadows’ Steam concurrents, which are being compared to those of other triple-A single-player games that recently released, as well as previous Assassin’s Creed games on Valve’s platform.\nShadows became the most-played Assassin's Creed game ever on Steam over the weekend with 64,825 peak concurrent players, although it’s worth noting that it was the first game in the series to launch day-one there since 2018's Odyssey. BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardsaw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.\nIt’s hard to make a call on whether Shadows is below, meeting, or exceeding Ubisoft’s expectations without knowing what those expectations were. But a source from within Ubisoft, who revealed an internal email reviewed by IGN, has helped us better understand the game’s first weekend performance.\nHere’s what we’ve found out: Shadows delivered the second-highest day-one sales revenue in the franchise’s history, behind only 2020’s Valhalla, which launched across the last and current generation of consoles and benefited from stay-at-home gaming fueled by the pandemic.\nShadows also marked Ubisoft’s best ever day-one launch on the PlayStation Store, suggesting particular success on PS5.\nBut what about PC, given Shadows launched on Steam as well as Ubisoft’s own digital store? According to Ubisoft’s internal communication, 27% of Shadows’ total “activations” were on PC. Ubisoft is telling employees that Steam “played a major role” in Shadows’ performance on PC, without revealing exact sell-through numbers. It says early results “are a strong validation of our decision to return to the platform.”\nGenerally, Ubisoft is talking up player engagement, which is at “record levels,” and “feedback across moderated, verified platforms — those less affected by review bombing — remains incredibly positive.” Shadows was also the most-wishlisted Ubisoft game of all time, and it’s doing better than any other Assassin’s Creed game on Twitch, even Valhalla.\nIt’s here that Ubisoft’s internal communication provides context on comparisons between Shadows’ launch and other games in the franchise. What’s clear is that Shadows is not doing as well as Valhalla did at launch, but Ubisoft is saying it’s not fair to compare the two, because Valhalla benefitted from the “perfect storm” of pandemic-fueled stay-at-home gaming and the launch of the Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5 in 2020.\n“Valhalla launched under extraordinary conditions — in the middle of a global pandemic, with widespread lockdowns and brand-new console hardware,” the internal communication reads. “It was a perfect storm we may never see again. That’s why it’s more meaningful to compare Shadows to entries like Origins, Odyssey, and Mirage — games released in more typical cycles. And in that frame, Shadows is already setting a new bar as illustrated above.”\nUbisoft also pointed out that Shadows released in March. Historically, Assassin’s Creed games launch just ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving window, which typically boosts sales. Meanwhile, Ubisoft ditched the early access period it normally charges extra for with its games. It’s also worth noting that Ubisoft’s own subscription offering is now available directly on Xbox, which affects sales on Microsoft’s console and muddies sales comparisons.\nMoney talks, of course, and irrespective of player numbers and engagement, it will be revenue brought in by Assassin’s Creed Shadows that determines the fate of not just the game, but Ubisoft itself. We may not get a clear picture of that until Ubisoft's next financial report in the coming months.\nAdventuring across feudal Japan?

    "full_text": "The Nintendo Switch 2 arrives on June 5, 2025, and it will likely be a hot commodity when it launches. Over on the official Nintendo store, the company is implementing some pre-order measures to ensure bona fide Switch players are getting their pre-orders.\n\nOn theMy Nintendo Store, those with a Nintendo Account can register their interest in pre-ordering a Nintendo Switch 2 system and \"select accessories\" from the Nintendo Store. Those who express interest will then get an invitation email once their turn in line comes up, valid for 72 hours. The catch? You'll need to have put in some time on your old Switch, and been a Switch Online member.\n\"Invitation emails will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis to registrants who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025,\" according to the fine print on the site.\nNintendo also notes that invitations are \"non-transferable\" and will be sent to email addresses associated with the Nintendo Account that registers interest. For the system and each accessory, there will also be a one-per-account limit during the invitation period. Currently on the site, you can express interest in either a base Nintendo Switch 2 system, or the one bundled with Mario Kart World.\nOrders will be shipped after purchase, and the approximate shipping date will be provided when ordering. Nintendo also specifies: \"Please note that release-day delivery is not guaranteed due to processing and shipment times.\"\nWhile not said outright by Nintendo, all of these measures seem dedicated towards ensuring that someone buying a Switch 2 through this process is someone who wants to purchase and play a Switch 2 for themselves, rather than flip it online.\nScalping has been a frequent problem for new releases of sought-after products. Notably, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S sawscalpers pursuing the new hardware, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game hasbeen dealing with ongoing scalping and shortages.\nValve found some success in its queue system for the Steam Deck, utilizing a method that tied Steam accounts to purchases alongside checks for whether an account was made before, or after, a certain window.It worked, and it's not surprising now to see Nintendo taking similar measures with the My Nintendo Store process.\nOf course, there will be other ways to pick up a Switch 2. But hopefully options like this can help some long-time Switch 1 owners avoid the potential chaos of locking down a launch day Switch 2 pre-order.\nEric is a freelance writer for IGN."

    "full_text": "Update 3/14/25 12:02 p.m. ET: Like most limited-edition PS5 hardware releases, the stock situation for this controller appears to be severely, uh, limited. It's currently (possibly!) available atPS Direct. Stock is also holding steady atGameStop, but you can only preorder it if you have a Pro membership (you cansign up herefor $25/year).\n\nIt's currently sold out atAmazon,Best Buy,Target, andWalmart, though it's possible any of them could get more stock at some point. I'll keep updating this article as things change.\nHere’s one for the post-apocalyptic crowd: Sony is releasing a new limited-edition The Last of Us-themed DualSense controller. ThePS5 controllerfeatures an eye-catching black and white design, with trophy icons from The Last of Us Part I and Part II etched into it. It comes out April 10 with an MSRP of $84.99. Preorders are live now at various retailers (see it on PS Direct). Read on for the details.\nThe controller was made “in close collaboration” with the Naughty Dog creative team. It features white-on-black icons of the Fireflies’ logo on the touchpad, with the moth and wolf on either side of the grips. A number of other icons also appear in glossy black on matte black. The bottom side of the controller has a The Last of Us logo in white on black. It looks very nice and classy overall, I’d say.\nOn thePlayStation Blog, Naughty Dog Head of Studio and Head of Creative Neil Druckmann and Graphic Designer Megan Mehran said:\n“We were excited by the chance to memorialize The Last of Us franchise in a controller that fans and our own team would love. We wanted to ensure that both installments of The Last of Us are represented, via trophy icons printed in black gloss across the controller body. Among the trophies, three particular images will immediately stand out for TLOU fans: The firefly, moth, and wolf. Players will recognize the Fireflies’ iconic spray-painted logo that originated in Part I, while the moth and wolf represent the intertwining lives and duality between Ellie and Abby in Part II.“\nThis isn’t the first PS5 game-themed limited-edition controller to hit the market. Others based on games likeAstro Bot,Helldivers 2,Spider-Man 2, andFortnitehave come out, among others, some of which are still available. And those are in addition to all the otherPS5 controllers in various colorsthat are available.\nThis The Last of Us controller comes out right around a couple of related releases. The Last of Us Part II is coming to PC on April 3, while the second season of theHBO showpremieres on April 13.\nChris Reed is a deals expert and commerce editor for IGN.

Especially for the 55\" model, you won't find a better TV for under $1,000.\n\nGenerally speaking, OLED TVs are considered the best TVs you can buy right now.

    "full_text": "Amazon has recently dropped the price on the2TB SK Hynix P41 PlatinumPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVME solid state drive (SSD) to only $124.99 shipped. The SK Hynix P41 Platinum is one of thefastest PCI-E 4.0 SSDs available, has DRAM cache, and is considerably less expensive than other comparable SSDs like theSamsung 990 Pro($168) and theWD SN850X($154). This is an excellent SSD for either your PlayStation 5 console or gaming PC.\n\nUpdate:Price has dropped again from $129.99 to $124.99.\nSK Hynix might not be as recognizable of a brand as Samsung or Western Digital among consumers, but make no mistake that they are a major player in the flash memory market. SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and one of the world's largest memory chipmakers and semiconductor companies. They supply components for many reputable brands you've probably heard of, like Corsair and G.Skill.\nThe Platinum P41 is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read speeds of 7,000MB/s and write speeds of 6,500MB/s as well as random read speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and write speeds of 1.3 million IOPS. The Platinum P41 also has a dedicated DRAM cache, Most SSDs at this price point lack any DRAM cache and instead rely on HMB, or system memory, to cover the shortfall. In terms of reliability and stability, th Platinum P41 has been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written. It uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips, both of which are manufactured in-house. SK Hynix warranties this SSD with a 5 year warranty.\nThe SK Hynix P41 Platinum makes for a great secondary SSD for your PlayStation 5 console since it performs well above Sony's minimum speed recommendation of 5,600MB/s. It's possible this SSD will run fine without a heatsink, but we like to err on the side of caution and would recommend you install one for peace of mind. Besides, you can get a perfectly adequateslim PS5 heatsink for just $7.\nThe Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.\nLooking for more options?

Still, we do know it’s the top-selling game on Steam, where Ubisoft recently returned after years of PC launch exclusivity on the Epic Games Store.\nAt the time of this article’s publication, Assassin’s Creed Shadows was on 58,894 concurrent players on Steam, enough to break into the top 30 most-played games on Valve’s platform. That peak is expected to rise as we continue into the game’s opening weekend.\nFor comparison, Origins’ all-time Steam peak was 41,551, over seven years ago, and Odyssey’s was 62,069. It seems likely Shadows will become the most-played Assassin's Creed game on Steam later this weekend.\nBioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardlaunched on Steam on Thursday, October 31, 2024, and saw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.\nThe true concurrent peak of Assassin’s Creed Shadows will of course be much higher, given it launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S also.

This week, IGN confirmed thatUbisoft had quietly released a day-one patch for Assassin’s Creed Shadowsthat made a number of important changes seemingly in response to concern from some Japanese politicians about in-game temples and shrines.\nIn a remarkable exchange this week, Japanese politician and member of the House of Councillors of Japan, Hiroyuki Kada, raised the issue of Assassin’s Creed Shadows in an official government meeting, andShigeru Ishiba, the Prime Minister of Japan, responded.\nOn Steam at least, Assassin's Creed Shadows is going down very well with players. It has a 'very positive' user review rating, with 81% of over 6,000 user reviews marked as positive. IGN’sAssassin’s Creed Shadows reviewreturned an 8/10.

Things have got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family and largest shareholderhave reportedly been exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investorson a buyout deal that would let them preserve control.\nAssassin's Creed Shadows has also endured a number of controversies, not least in Japan. Yesterday, IGN confirmed thatUbisoft had quietly released a day-one patch forAssassin’s Creed Shadowsthat made a number of important changes seemingly in response to concern from some Japanese politicians about in-game temples and shrines.\nIn a remarkable exchange this week, Japanese politician and member of the House of Councillors of Japan, Hiroyuki Kada, raised the issue of Assassin’s Creed Shadows in an official government meeting, andShigeru Ishiba, the Prime Minister of Japan, responded.\nOn Steam at least, Assassin's Creed Shadows is going down very well with players. It has a 'very positive' user review rating, with 82% of the near 4,000 user reviews marked as positive. IGN’sAssassin’s Creed Shadows reviewreturned an 8/10. We said: “By sharpening the edges of its existing systems, Assassin’s Creed Shadows creates one of the best versions of the open-world style it’s been honing for the last decade.”\nAdventuring across feudal Japan?

    "title": "Is the Console War Finally Over?",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-08T17:30:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/is-the-console-war-finally-over",
    "full_text": "PlayStation or Xbox? It’s the long-running question of the modern video game world. At one point or another in your life, you’ve almost certainly been a part of this debate. Maybe you’ve started a Reddit thread, or made a TikTok video, or struck up a heated chat between friends about it. While therearegamers who preach the PC gospel, and Nintendo-as-god fanatics, much of the last two decades of video game history has been made as a result of Sony and Microsoft’s ongoing tete-a-tete. But is this ‘console war’ truly still being waged? The video game industry has gone through immense change in the last year, let alone over the previous two decades. Gamers’ habits, preferences, and options have all increased exponentially in part thanks to the rise of handheld gaming and younger generations’ expertise in building their own gaming machines. The battlefield is now practically unrecognisable compared to its tribal-like origins, but has a victor finally emerged from the trenches? Possibly – but the answer may surprise you.\n\nThe video game industry has rapidly evolved to become a financial juggernaut in recent years. In 2019, its worldwide revenue was $285 billion. Last year, it was $475 billion. That figure means that video games made more than the entire world wide movie and music industries in 2023, which made$308 billionand$28.6 billionrespectively. There’s no sign of this growth stopping, either. By 2029, the industry is estimated to generate nearly$700 billion. Not bad considering its humble Pong origins.\nAll this considered, it’s no surprise that we’ve seen an uptick in Hollywood actors flocking to be a part of a scene with such a lucrative present and future. Mads Mikkelsen, Keanu Reeves, Jon Bernthal and Willem Dafoe to name a few have all starred in games released in the past five years. Their involvement reflects the monumental shift in the perception of video games. Even industry titans like Disney are making significant in-roads into gaming, havingjust invested $1.5 billion into Epic Gamesas part of Bob Iger’s second term challenge to solidify a gaming presence for the company. A rising tide should lift all boats – unless you’re aboard the U.S.S. Microsoft, which seems to have sprung a leak.\nThe Xbox Series X and S consoles are intended to be an upgrade from the Xbox One in every way. But their advancements have yet to prove truly enticing; the One currently ranks above the Series X/S by almost double the sales. When you couple this fact with comments from analytics company Circana’s games industry expert, Mat Piscatella, who hassuggested that this current console generation is now past its selling peak, it paints a worrying picture for team Xbox. Things appear even worse when you look at console sales figures from 2024. According to Statista, the Xbox Series X/Ssold less than 2.5 million units across the entire year– the PlayStation 5sold the same figure in the first quarter of 2024 alone. There are also the allegations that Xbox is supposedly closing down its department which handles the manufacture and delivery of games to physical retailers, which feels ominously connected to itsevasive responseto areport that it plans to pull out of selling consoles in the EMEA region. If Xbox really has been involved in a ‘console war’, all of this points to the signal to retreat.\nBut Xbox isn't retreating – it has already surrendered. During the long Activision-Blizzard acquisition process, a statement from Microsoft found in the findings of fact revealed that the company doesn’t believe its Xbox division lost the console war –it thinks it never had a shot to begin with. So, what does a company built around a video game console do when its newest model is struggling to match its predecessor in sales, and its parent company openly remarks on its failure? It gets out of the console business.\nIt's no secret that Xbox Game Pass has become a key priority for the company.Leaked internal documentsrevealed the estimated prices Xbox expected to be asked to pay to put AAA-titles like Grand Theft Auto 5 ($12-15 million per month) and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor ($300 million) on the subscription service. Xbox taking such costs seriously demonstrates the company consolidating cloud gaming as a key direction for it moving forward. That goal is clear to see in Microsoft’s recent ‘This Is An Xbox’ advertising campaign, which suggests the company is keen to redefine how players think of Xbox – no longer a console, but an always-accessible service with some hardware to complement it instead.\nIt seems like this rethinking of what an Xbox is means that the brand’s official hardware won’t be limited to being a box under your TV. An Xbox handheld has been rumored to be in development for the past year or so, backed by another leaked document from the Activision-Blizzard dealings which hints at using handheld-friendly hardware for a next-gen'hybrid cloud gaming platform'. But Microsoft’s pivot in strategy has hardly been a secret. From its announcement of plans to createa mobile game storeto compete with Apple and Google, to Xbox chief Phil Spencer’s own admission that mobile gaming’s dominance in the sphere is shaping the company’s own path moving forward, the new M.O. seems simple: Xbox is the video game brand you can play whenever you want, wherever you are.\nSo why is Microsoft pivoting? Sure, Xbox has struggled over the past couple of generations, but doesn’t the video game console market reign supreme? You’d be surprised. In 2024, of the total 3.3 billion estimated video gamers,over 1.93 billion of them play via a mobile device. That, of course, includes your grandmother playing Candy Crush Saga and your “non-gamer” cousin who still clocks up hours of Clash of Clans. But mobile gaming is now so much more than these casual audiences – over the last decade it has quickly become the dominant pillar of the video game market among every generation, but especially Gen Z and Gen Alpha. In 2024, thetotal market valuation for the video game industrywas $184.3 billion, with mobile games comprising exactly half of that entire figure at $92.5 billion (a 2.8% increase from the previous year). Where do consoles weigh in? At just $50.3 billion, or 27%, and that’s dropped 4% since 2023. No wonder Microsoft wants to turn your phone into an Xbox.\nBut this isn’t a new development. By 2013, the Asian market for mobile gaming was already dwarfing that of the western world by heights of 759% in South Korea and 280% in China. You might think GTA 5 was the most profitable game of 2013, but you’d be wrong: Both Puzzle & Dragon and Candy Crush Saga outperformed Rockstar’s juggernaut by $1.5 and $1.4 billion respectively. Take a wide-angle lens to the 2010s as a whole for video games, and you’ll find that five of the highest-grossing games were mobile games – Crossfire, Monster Strike, Honor of Kings, Puzzle & Dragon, and Clash of Clans. When you look back on the decade, I highly doubt any of these titles immediately spring to mind – and yet, I’m sure most reading this have the start-up music for Clash of Clans seared into their brains.\nPhones are not the only platform drawing attention away from consoles. While not as significant as mobile gaming’s explosion, it’s clear to see that player habits have shifted toward a greater appreciation for PC gaming. Since 2014, there has been a year-on-year growth of 59 million new PC players, taking us from 1.31 billion in 2014 to1.86 billion in 2024. It’s worth noting this rise is complimented by a gargantuan 200 million in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic, during which streaming became a very attractive pastime for many house-bound players. But regardless of if Twitch called to them or not, gamers have become more technologically literate, educated by their peers online on how to build a PC powerhouse, what the best GPUs are, and how to overclock your circuit-ware. As a result, the PC’s global share of the video game market in 2024 lands at $41.5 billion – so it won’t be long until the PC battleline overtakes the army of console players, right? Well, maybe not.Netzoo’s 2016 Global Games Market Value reportdefined a $2.3 billion gap between console and PC – but in 2024, that gap has increased to $9 billion. So despite the rise of more advanced GPUs, circuit-boards, and Gen Z and Alpha’s technological craftiness, it’s a market that’s on thefallrather than the rise – at least for now. If that fall continues, it's not great news for Xbox, which has made Windows PCs its second home.\nBut it’s not just the dominance of mobile and the uncertain future of PC that Xbox has to contend with. Wars typically have two opposing sides, so it’s about time we looked at where PlayStation fits into this console war. Luckily for Sony, things are going pretty well. In its latest quarterly earnings report, Sony revealed75 million PS5s have been sold to date– that’s a big lead ahead of the combined 29.7 million sales for the Xbox Series X/S. The gap between the two consoles is widening, too; stats suggest that for every one Xbox Series X/S bought during November 2024,five PlayStation 5 consoles were also purchased(a ratio no doubt helped by the launch of the PS5 Pro.) Sony’s Game and Network Services also saw a healthy 12.3% bump in its profits during the final months of 2024, helped specifically by healthy first-party sales including Astro Bot selling 1.5 million copies in under two months, and lifetime sales for Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut surpassing 13 million. The future looks very bright for the PS5. Ampere Analysis’ games research director, Piers Harding-Rolls,estimates that by 2029, Sony will have sold 106.9 million consoles. How do things look for the Xbox Series X/S’s future? Well, leaked Microsoft documents estimate that by 2027,it expects to have sold around 56-59 million units. While it’s not a directly comparable projection, it’s not good. In order for Microsoft to re-establish its competitive edge in the current market, it will need to close the 5:1 PlayStation-to-Xbox gap, significantly increase the number of units sold year-on-year, and also bolster the profitability of its exclusives. Projections don’t support a positive outcome for those first two requirements, and given Phil Spencer’s ‘no red lines’ mantra on Xbox titles coming to PlayStation and Switch (possibly even including the next Halo title), the argument could be made that PlayStation is already the King of Console.\nBut looking at the PS5 in isolation paints a different picture. 50% of all PlayStation users arecurrently still playing on older PS4sinstead of PS5s, despite the newest generation now entering the second half of its life-cycle. Why is this? Well, of the top 20 best-selling games in the U.S. in 2024, only one is truly PS5-exclusive – Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, at #19. Helldivers 2 does feature at #3 but was also playable on PC at launch. Looking beyond last year, if we disregard remasters of PS4 games, there are roughly 15 genuine PS5-exclusive games on the console as a whole. There’s little here to justify the console’s price in many people’s eyes.\nIf the PS5 is struggling to justify its regular $500 price tag, then it's understandable why the $700 PS5 Pro debuted to a mixed reception to say the least. The general consensus amongst tech journalists is that perhaps this upgrade came tooearlywithin the cycle, especially given the games advertised in its campaign were slightly upscaled generation-old remasters. WhenIGN polled its readers, the result was overwhelmingly clear – the PS5 Pro has little to offer for forking over that much cash. So, simply put, the PS5 simply isn’t a must-buy console – at least, not yet. This will undoubtedly change when the behemoth that is Grand Theft Auto 6 finally releases later this year, which is almost guaranteed to become the shining star of this generation and the first chance for the PS5 to show off its true power.\nSo, is the console war over? If you’re Microsoft, it would appear there was never any belief that there was a chance to battle Sony for supremacy. If you’re Sony, your new console has become a success but lacks the true pedigree to be claimed as a new leap forward yet, feeling more like a bunny hop than anything else. The true winner of the console war seems to be those who chose not to play it at all. Rumors of mobile gaming companies encroaching onto the traditional console gaming sphere will only ramp up in the years to come, with Tencent rumored to be in talks to buy out Ubisoft from the Guillemot brothers, having already purchased Sumo Group in 2021. Mobile gaming is becoming increasingly pivotal to the sustainability and profitability of these companies – Take-Two Interactive claim that 10% of the world’s population plays its subsidiary Zynga’s games every month. That means that it’s more than likely that your grandma playing Zynga Poker and Words with Friends 2 is funding the continued development of Grand Theft Auto 6 – not a sentence you would expect to read five years ago, but one reflective of the new state of play of the video game market. The next five years of video gaming history will be defined less and less by who has the most powerful hardware, and more about whose cloud gaming server farm can expand the quickest and strongest. The console war is over, but the mobile gaming war (and the myriad of smaller conflicts that inevitably spin out of it) has only begun.\nSab Astley is a freelance writer who has written for IGN, Polygon, TotalFilm, Rolling Stone, Radio Times, and Metro UK.Editors note: this feature has been updated to better clarify sales figures of PlayStation and Xbox consoles."

    "full_text": "Bethesda has announced that MachineGames’Indiana Jones and The Great Circlelaunches on PlayStation 5 on April 15 for early access ahead of a global release on April 17. Those whopre-ordergetaccess to the early access.\n\nThe PS5 release date, which comes four months after Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launched on Xbox and PC, was announced alongside a playful promo trailer that sees perhaps the two most famous video game actors in the world on-screen together.\nIn the trailer, Indiana Jones actor Troy Baker sits down for a chat with Uncharted star Nolan North, who famously plays intrepid explorer Nathan Drake in the PlayStation-exclusive series. Drake and the Uncharted series are of course heavily inspired by Indiana Jones, so this meeting of the actors who play the characters is a full circle moment for The Great Circle itself.\nThere’s an added layer here, which is the Microsoft-owned Bethesda has drafted in Nolan North, the actor behind the Sony-owned franchise Uncharted, for a chinwag in one of its adverts. Now, at no point does North say ‘Nathan Drake’ or ‘Uncharted’ or anything that might legally belong to Sony Computer Entertainment, but his delivery in the video is knowing indeed.\nDrake — I mean North — playfully suggests he broke into the lavishly decorated room in which he’s sat and so doesn’t have much time to talk. The suggestion here is goons might burst through the door at any moment, as they tend to do when Nate is rummaging through drawers on the hunt for clues.\nNorth asks Baker how he’s going to deal with Private Military Forces with just a whip. Baker points to his head, saying, “use the old—” “headbutt,” North interjects. “I like it. Aggressive.” North says he’s “more of a sidearms kinda guy… jeans… henley,” and, as Baker quips, “somehow always half-tucked.”\nBoth North and Baker then bond over a shared enthusiasm for ancient artefacts, although North wants to sell them to the highest bidder, while Baker wants to donate them to a museum. This is Nathan Drake accepting the new Indiana Jones into a “very exclusive club” of adventurers. “Welcome to the club,” North declares. Xbox’s Indiana Jones now sits proudly alongside PlayStation’s Uncharted on Sony’s console, treasure-hunters in crime. All that’s left is for Lara Croft to break through the window and say something about not wanting the boys to have all the fun.\nThis is all part of Microsoft’s now-established multiplatform push, which has already seen a number of Xbox games launch on rival consoles. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is just the latest to make the jump, with Playground’s Forza Horizon 5, Id Software’s Doom: The Dark Ages and, reportedly, many more Microsoft-made games not far behind.\nBoosted by launching day one on Game Pass, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has so farreached 4 million players— a figure that will no doubt see a significant boost once the PS5 version goes live.\nIndiana Jones actor Harrison Ford has saidTroy Baker playing the beloved character in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is proof \"you don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul.\"\nFord discussed alleviating control of Indy withThe Wall Street Journal, saying he was very happy with the performance of The Last of Us actor Baker.\n\"You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul,\" Ford said. \"You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent.

From cases and screen protectors to docks and headphones, these items either enhance your playing experience or help protect Sony’s remote player. Right now, many accessories are 10% to over 40% off, bringing the lowest prices of 2025 so far. Chances are good you won’t see savings like these for at least another few months, so now is the time to buy.\n\nSure, thePlayStation Portalmay not be as portable as the name suggests, as it relies on a strong Wi-Fi signal to stream games. Still, if you’ve got a good connection, you can take the device just about anywhere. Plus, thePlayStation Portal now supports cloud gamingvia a PlayStation Plus subscription, so a PS5 is no longer required to play.\nIf you’ve been hesitant to buy the gaming handheld in the past, this added functionality brings more value. You can evengrab the PlayStation Portal in a new Midnight Blackcolorway, and then be sure to get some discounted accessories to go with it, since only a USB-C to USB-C charging cable comes in the box.\nWith a large and sharp 8-inch LCD screen and Dual Sense style controls, the PS Portal is susceptible to damage. An accidental drop or too much pressure in a bag could end up bricking the pricey remote player, making a case a high priority.\nOrzly’s caseis one of thebest PlayStation Portal casesyou can grab. It perfectly matches the device’s dimensions for a snug fit, offers a padded section for accessories, and comes with a hard shell for extra protection, and the case is $15 off during Amazon’s sale. Want something a little less expensive? There’s a great deal at the moment on a durablecase from FYOUNGwith similar features to the Orzly case. If you need something extra tough, theSTARTRC GAMES Carrying Caseis designed to take on a little more wear and tear than your average hard shell case. It’s also on sale.\nA zippered hard shell case won’t protect the PlayStation Portal when you’re actually playing a game. So, those with butter fingers might want to consider some additional protection. A screen protector is a great way to prevent cracks to the precious display when the device falls from your grip, and our favoritetwo-pack of screen protectors from ivolerhappens to be a part of Amazon’s sale. Speaking of grip, a form-fitting case, likethis discounted option from Qoosea, gives you a better handle on the device while wrapping it with an extra layer of protection against scratches, dust, and more.\nRather than buying each accessory individually to keep the PlayStation Portal safe in various situations, plenty of accessory sets are on sale during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. These kits come with a hard shell case for travel and storage, a form-fitting cover for protection while you play, and screen protectors to keep scratches to the screen at bay. Some go even further, offering thumbstick covers and extra space for SD cards, cords, and more.\nWhile most PlayStation Portal accessories focus on protection, a couple others are worth the investment to make life with the device even better.\nYou'll want a pair ofgreat gaming earbudsto keep games distraction free, andTurtle Beach’s Battle Budsare currently discounted. Yes, these are wired because the PlayStation Portal does not support Bluetooth audio. Wireless headsets require PlayStation Link support. Unfortunately, we’re not seeing any major discounts on the few options that do offer PlayStation’s proprietary wireless.\nA charging dock is another sound purchase, as you’ll need something to top up the remote player after its 7 to 9 hours of battery life runs out. A charging dock provides a secure place to store your device as it charges. Our favorite charging dock, theFYoung Charging Dock Stationis on sale, and beyond charging the Portal in 3.5 hours, it adds some visual flair to your space with 14 customizable color options. Asimilar option from LVVILis also on sale.\nDanielle is a Tech freelance writer based in Los Angeles who spends her free time creating videos and geeking out over music history."

It turns your PS5 into a gaming handheld by letting you stream games from your console at up to 60fps. The controller mirrors the same features found on the DualSense, including haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and a touchscreen interface that replaces the Dualsense's touchpad. The Portal can stream your games even when you're outside of your home, with the caveat that you have access tovery stable, very fastinternet connection.

Now, rather than being limited to simply streaming games from a $500 console to a $200 handheld, Sony has introduced a feature that lets owners stream games directly from its PlayStation Now cloud streaming service. No PS5 required. Portal owners now have the option to either connect the Portal to their PS5 as before, or directly to Sony’s cloud servers. Choose the latter and suddenly you have access to a library of more than 120 games, including Ghost of Tsushima, Resident Evil 3 Remake, The Last of Us Part 1 Remastered, and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.It’s worth noting you must be a subscriber to the highest tier of PlayStation Plus, but $18 a month is much more attractive that splashing out $500 upfront plus an extra $70 a game.\nIt should be said that the PlayStation Portal isn’t the only way to stream your PS5 games over Wi-Fi within your home. You can mimic its functionality by downloading the PS Remote Play app on a mobile device, including other gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck.  That said, it's more complicated to set up and you'll lose out on some of the Dualsense's features.\nPlayStation Portal Reviewby Seth Macy\n\"The PlayStation Portal is the most surprising device I've ever come away from loving after going in loaded with skepticism. It's such a better experience than using your phone with a slap-on controller, and it works so much better than I was anticipating. I really love the freedom it gives me to play my PS5 from anywhere with decent WiFi coverage, especially when the rest of my family was using the TV to (somewhat ironically) play the Switch. Bearing in mind that it’s in no way a stand-alone device and 100% requires a PlayStation 5 to function at all, the biggest things keeping the Portal from being a truly amazing device are its current lack of a way to access WiFi that requires a web browser to log in, and its lack of Bluetooth support for audio. For now, it's a great device that represents the best current solution for PlayStation Remote Play, and if it weren't for those two baffling caveats, I'd call this a must-own device for every PS5 owner who enjoys playing games on handheld – or has to compete for the household TV.\"\nLenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code \"PLAY5\" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "full_text": "Sony has confirmed The Last of Us Part II Remastered PC specs ahead of its April 3 release date, PSN sign-in incentives, and announced new content coming to No Return Mode across PC and PlayStation 5.\n\nIn a post on thePlayStation Blog, developer Naughty Dog listed the features that support studios Nixxes Software and Iron Galaxy helped bring to the PC version of The Last of Us Part II Remastered, which arrives a year after the PlayStation 5 version.\nThere’s also support for Ultrawide monitors, so you can play in 21:9 ultra-wide, 32:9 super ultra-wide, and even 48:9 resolutions with compatibility for triple-monitor setups.\nAs you’d expect, you can play in 4K resolution, with various supported controllers as well as keyboard and mouse controls. There’s 3D audio, too.\nKeyboard and mouse control support includes new control customization options, including full control remapping, primary and secondary bindings for keyboard and mouse control, and an adaptive mode that allows players to combine keyboard and controller inputs. There’s full gamepad support, while DualSense controllers feature full haptic feedback.\n“The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC offers a wide range of graphics settings and presets, to ensure the best possible experience on hardware ranging from high-end PCs to handheld gaming devices,” Sony said.\nMoving on to No Return mode, two new characters are being added: The Last of Us Part I’s Bill and Marlene.\nHere’s the official blurb from Sony:\nFour new maps are coming to No Return, too.\nAll the new No Return content, plus accompanying new Trophies and additional bug fixes, will be available on PS5 day-and-date with the PC launch via a free downloadable 2.0.0 patch, Sony added.\nIn keeping withSony’s recent PlayStation Network requirement U-turn, The Last of Us 2 Remastered on PC has an optional PSN log-in.

In aninterviewwith Alex Garland, the writer of zombie movie 28 Days Later, Druckmann talked candidly about the development process, confirming Intergalactic has been in the works for four years.\n\"I joke about this with the team. We made a game,The Last of Us 2, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game,\" Druckmann said, to which Garland joked: \"Who gives a shit?\"\n\"Exactly,\" Druckmann added. \"But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about — let's make a game about faith and religion.\"\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which stars Tati Gabrielle as Jordan A. Mun, takes place in an alternate historical timeline and features a \"pretty prominent religion\" that has \"changed and bastardized and evolved\" over the years, Druckmann said.\nThe PC version of The Last of Us 2 Remastered arrives ahead of Season 2 of HBO's hit TV adaptation.

    "title": "How Assassin's Creed Shadows Makes the Most of Its “Boring” Setting",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-19T13:30:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/how-assassins-creed-shadows-makes-the-most-of-its-boring-setting",
    "full_text": "In 2012, Assassin’s Creed 3 director Alex Hutchinson called out people on the internet for suggesting the most “boring” future settings for the series. “The three most wanted [settings for Assassin’s Creed] are WWII, feudal Japan and Egypt,” he explained at the time, adding “They’re kind of the three worst settings for an AC game.” Hutchinson later clarified his statement, saying “the point I was trying to make was that in the broad strokes and scale of history, that’s a theme that’s been well-mined in video games.” He’s not wrong and since he made his most recent comments, Ghost of Tsushima, Rise of the Ronin, Nioh and more have all shone a spotlight on feudal Japan.\n\nFast-forward to 2025 and Assassin’s Creed is finally going to one of these “worst” settings with Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, but Shadows director Jonathan Dumont believes his team has found a new way to tell the story of feudal Japan.\n\"I think it's not boring at all. The setting is very exciting,\" Dumont says when asked about Hutchinson’s quote. \"I do think that being able to bring it to life and have that balance of the political intrigue [of the era], the war and conflict, and also the beauty of nature and supporting more exploration within this changing world give it another dimension [compared to other games].\"\nHutchinson wasn’t wrong back in 2012. The setting of Feudal Japan has indeed been one of the most requested locations for the Assassin's Creed series. Bringing the series' unique blend of historical fiction and sci-fi to the backdrop of warring states and samurai in fierce conflict seemed like a no-brainer for developer Ubisoft to make happen sooner rather than later. The only problem was Ubisoft chose later, perhaps to its detriment.\nThough Ubisoft has been praised for exploring previously overlooked historical settings like Egypt and Industrial Revolution England, other developers have beaten Ubisoft to open-world stealth-action games set in Japan with titles like Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Tsushima. That said, shows like FX’s Shogun prove that people’s appetites for samurai action hasn’t waned in the least. Much like Shogun, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows explores how outsiders navigate the courts and politics of feudal Japan. And the Assassin’s Creed name has a built-in reputation all on its own.\nDumont highlights the conflict and historical impact of the era – particularly in how Japan was \"opened up\" to the rest of the world for the first time following the arrival of Portuguese merchants and missionaries during the late 1500s Sengoku era.\n\"What made the setting interesting for us to tackle was the political landscape of the time, along with the arts and the environment of that era. We've seen other games do it before, but not in the Assassin's Creed way that we're doing it,\" says Dumont. \"We also have that big open-world feeling with the big cities, the wilderness, and we really touch upon the historical arts and the reconstruction of these locations to make it real for that time. So I don't think we've seen that necessarily in a lot of games [covering this era] – to truly explore and bring you into that world.”\nAccording to Dumont, the political intrigue of the era made it a particularly compelling setting to tackle for Assassin's Creed. A key difference he highlights that makes Shadows different from other games is how it brings a more dynamic and deeper dive into a politically troubled era filled with conflict – one that players will be able to immerse themselves in and learn more about almost from the moment the game begins.\nThere is also the matter of new technology that Ubisoft utilized in order to bring its version of Japan to life.\n\"The team was very enthusiastic about Assassin's Creed's take on Feudal Japan, and we felt that the latest technological improvements and new consoles would help us bring that vision to life,\" says Dumont. He highlights the dynamic weather and seamless open-world, and according to our review, the team seemingly succeeded in creating one of the best historical locations in Assassin’s Creed history.\nRemember, the Assassin’s Creed series began during the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 era, and since then technology has come a long way, with 4K resolution, bigger open worlds with greater density, and ray-tracing now standard on consoles and PC.\n\"What that does is give a much more 'alive' feeling than what we've done in the past [with other games],\" he continues. \"So I think that technology that took a few years to develop is omnipresent and all around you within the game. It does bring another dimension of being able to see the world in different states – which gives it more depth. It would not have been possible to make Shadows without our current technology; I don't think we would have gotten that feeling of losing ourselves in this open world without it.\"\nWhat makes the Assassin's Creed series so compelling is how it takes historical settings and injects its patented stealth-action gameplay and open-world immersion to make them all the more engrossing. Assassin's Creed Shadows leans into the samurai and ninja fantasy, much like other games tackling this setting. And the need to one-up the competition presented a big challenge to ensure the game's scope was well realized – and given the lengthy wait for the series to tackle a Japan setting, Dumont felt the wait was worth it.\n“It's really all about keeping the vision there, and the team keeps pushing for better quality in every aspect,” he says. “There's always a challenge with trying to meet people's expectations, and we also put the pressure on ourselves to do the best we can.\"\nFor more on Assassin's Creed Shadows, check outIGN's review of the game.\n"

    "full_text": "The modder who releaseda playable recreation of the Grand Theft Auto 6 map in Grand Theft Auto 5has ceased all work on the project after being hit by a takedown from Rockstar owner Take–Two.\n\n‘Dark Space’ had created a free-to-download playable GTA 5 map based on leaked coordinate data and official trailer shots of GTA 6, and uploaded gameplay footage to his YouTube channel. His videos and his mod hit the headlines in January as information-starved GTA fans flocked to experience a fan-made approximation of what they can expect to play officially when GTA 6 launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S this fall.\nThen, last week, Dark Space received the dreaded strike notification from YouTube after Take-Two issued a copyright removal request. If a YouTube channel receives multiple copyright strikes, it runs the risk of being terminated.\nIn response, Dark Space removed all download links to his mod, despite the fact he has yet to be asked to do so by Take-Two, and publisheda response videoon his channel calling out the company for its actions and suggesting it was the result of the mod's take on GTA 6's map being \"probably a little too accurate.\"\nDark Space was more philosophical in a follow-up interview with IGN. “I expected this would happen based on their past takedowns,” the modder said. “I went into this project knowing it was a possibility, and the fact that it happened does not surprise me.”\nDark Space said he believes Take-Two went after his mod because it was based on an online GTA 6 community mapping project that uses leaked coordinate points to “perfectly” map out the upcoming virtual space, and as a result might have ruined the surprise for players and the internet at large.\n“That's probably the biggest red flag, although most of the work in my map was based on the trailer shots,” Dark Space added.\n“I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get. If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too.”\nThe upshot is Dark Space’s GTA 6 mod project is no more. And that’s not just for YouTube videos of it, that’s for the entire thing. “Well they clearly do not want this project to exist,” Dark Space said. “So it's not just under threat, it's eliminated. There’s no point putting more time into something that goes directly against what they’re willing to allow.\n“I'm just going to keep making videos that people hopefully like. I probably won't do anything else modding GTA 5 in relation to GTA 6, since it seems dangerous.”\nThere are now concerns that the GTA 6 community mapping project could be next in Take-Two’s sights. IGN has contacted the group for comment.\nTake-Two has a history of taking down fan projects, most recentlythe YouTube channel belonging to the makers of the ‘GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition,’which ports the world, cutscenes, and missions from 2002’s Vice City into 2008’s GTA 4.\nOne former Rockstar developer has defended the company’s actions here, saying both Take-Two and Rockstar are protecting their business interests.\n“Take2/R* are a commercial company,” former Rockstar Games technical director Obbe Vermeijtweeted. “They will take down mods that interfere with their business interests.\n“The VC NextGen Edition mod for GTA4 directly competes with the Definitive Edition. The Liberty City preservation project (GTA4 in GTA5 engine) would interfere with a possible GTA4 remaster. (No idea whether they’re working on that. I think they should.)\n“There’s no point getting angry about it. This is what companies are supposed to do. The best we can hope for is that they allow mods that don’t interfere with their business. Such as DCA3 (GTA3 for Dreamcast). Afaik they have recently been decent about letting these projects continue.”\nWhile you wait for GTA 6 to come out, check out IGN’s coverage of an ex-Rockstar dev who saysthe studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025, Take-Two boss StraussZelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out, and the expert opinion onwhether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "full_text": "LG's most popular current generation OLED TV has been discounted starting today. Right now Amazon has dropped the price of the65\" LG Evo C4 4K OLED TVto $1,396.99. The LG Evo C-series of TVs - including this model - have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVsfor HDR movie watching and current generation console gaming.\n\nThe C4 is the 2024 model in LG's C-series OLED lineup. The LG Evo C5 hasn't yet been released, butit was showcased during CES 2025. At least on paper, the improvements of the C5 seem to be incremental, with no major ground breaking updates that would make you want to hold off until its launch. More importantly, the C5 will probably release at a very high retail price which will take months to get down to a level that's competitive with other TV deals.\nThe C4 uses LG's Evo panel, which offers higher brightness levels than traditional OLED TVs. Compared to a standard LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. Because of these advantages, the Evo OLED TV excels at displaying 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations.\nThe LG C4 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz and all four HDMI ports are 2.1 spec for running games in 4K at up to 120fps on a PS5 or Xbox Series X without any tearing. The C4 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM). The C4 is also easier to install than its predecessors; the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that weighs 36 pounds.\nThe LG Evo C-series TV is ourfavorite high-end 4K TV of 2025because of the brilliance of its OLED display along with a host of quality features that don't quite push it to the point of an excessively high price. This model brings better contrast and clarity than the previous year's already luminous LG C2. It’s a sight to behold, especially when you add in the deep blacks and well-balanced colors on the crisp 4K screen. Once you choose OLED, it's hard to go back to anything else.\nIf you bought a brand new TV over the holidays and you're looking for a good audio solution at an excellent price, then one of the best Black Friday deals is back.

You can get a brand new importedXbox Series XandPlayStation 5consoles for much lower than you can find a new model elsewhere. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming consoles that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by your account, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item. These consoles all ship locally from the United States and usually arrive within one week.\n\nAliExpress as a whole is a legitimate website, but since it is a marketplace comprised of individual sellers, you have to make sure that the vendor you're buying from is reputable. In many cases, the easiest way to do so is to look at the seller's rating and history. In terms of the products we've listed in this article, while it's true that some of the sellers may not have many reviews,AliExpress has reached out to us and personally vetted these vendors, which is why we feel comfortable promoting them. AliExpress also offers a 15 to 90 day free return policy depending on the product.\nAliExpress has dropped the price of the professional-grade Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Controller to only $74.42 shipped after you apply coupon code \"IFP3TXY\"in cart. That's a huge price drop from its normal $140 list price and nearly the same cost as a standard Xbox controller. Note that this is a Hong Kong or Japanese import model in new retail packaging, but you won't find it cheaper anywhere else. Aside from the different color scheme, the Core controller is identical to the Xbox Elite Series 2 non-Core controller. The Core controller, however, does not include the component pack. AliExpress offers a 90-day return policy.\nAliExpress also just dropped the price on a new retail boxed (imported) Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 wireless gaming controller – component pack included – to $100 shipped.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-is-the-control-multiplayer-fps-i-didnt-know-i-wanted",
    "full_text": "Control was IGN’s Game of the Year in 2019 – and I was one of the many editors that voted for it – but even I was skeptical when Remedy, a studio known for telling great single-player stories in third-person games, announced it was doing a Control multiplayer game. That project turned out to be FBC: Firebreak, a three-player PvE first-person multiplayer shooter set six years after the events of Control. And in the hands-off demo I saw, it very quickly became clear that my skepticism was completely unwarranted. Firebreak is refreshingly original in an oversaturated space, delightfully weird amidst a sea of same-y military and/or sci-fi online shooters, and perhaps best of all, it doesn’t require a massive commitment like so many of its contemporaries. As game director Mike Kayatta put it, \"We're not about daily check-ins. We're not interested in monthly grinds. We don't want to give anybody a second job.\" Say it again, Mike, for the people in the back.\n\nFBC: Firebreak is a three-player co-op FPS with, if what Remedy is promising comes to pass, no nonsense. You can play for 20 minutes or a few hours if you want to, with Perk unlocks and new combinations amongst characters keeping things fresh for repeat runs. But what the heck are you doing here, back in The Oldest House, with a bevy of bizarre weaponry in your hands? Essentially, you are volunteer first responders in The Oldest House when things go seriously sideways. Your characters are secretaries, rangers, and other “normal” occupations who heed the call of service. The Federal Bureau of Control wouldn’t say you’re expendable, but…you’re expendable.\nWhen you log in to play, you choose a Job (aka a mission) and a Crisis Kit (essentially, your loadout) before setting the Threat Level (difficulty) and Clearance Level, which determines how many zones you'll be playing through in a run. The zones are separated by containment doors, which will take you to the next stage of the Job. And the Job I saw is called Paper Chase, and it’s set in a fairly mundane office section of the FBC building. The Hiss are spreading, and it’s up to you and your two teammates to work together to beat them back.\nOf course, you can get the hell out of there as soon as you can if you like, but if you want to get your hands on currencies that let you upgrade and buy new gear, you have to escape safely with them. And the longer you spend exploring for currency, the harder it is to make it back to HQ in one piece.\nSpeaking of gear, that’s where FBC: Firebreak starts to set itself apart from other multiplayer shooters. Many of the guns are charmingly unusual, and most have a homebrew feel, like the hand-cranked snowball-launching gun that can put out fires (or your friends who are on fire) and soak the sticky-note monster (uh, more on him in a bit). Or the cobbled-together zapper that, when fitted with the right nozzle, can rain down lightning storms on a room full of bad guys. Or the large wrench that, when a squeaky piggy bank toy is attached, causes a swirl of coins to pelt your opponents. Don’t worry, though; there are still staples like a machinegun and shotgun – the latter of which is the go-to for after you’ve either soaked or zapped one of the sticky-note monsters.\nOh yes, about them: the entire point of this particular Job is to eliminate all of the sticky notes before they overrun the entire brutalist building. Note the number of sticky notes left to destroy in the upper left corner. It will actually go way up as the mission progresses because, by the end of it, you face off against…a gigantic sticky-note monster. Think Sandman from the end of Spider-Man 3, but made out of sticky Post-It notes instead of sand.\nBut it’s not just about weird weapons. There are also fun in-universe gameplay mechanics, too, like the office supply shelf that refills your ammo, the makeshift turret you build after literally dumping it out of a box onto the floor, the stereo speaker that keeps the Hiss at bay, and the rinse station that washes any aggressive sticky notes off of your face. Unlockable Perks also inject more spice and variety into the gameplay. A couple of examples I saw: a Perk where each missed bullet has a chance to return to your clip, and another that lets you extinguish yourself by jumping up and down. Also, if you get two of the same Perk you get a stronger version of it. If you get three, you can share the Perk’s effect with nearby teammates.\nBy the way, in case you’re wondering, you don’t have to have three people in order to play. You can play solo or in duos as well. Meanwhile, Remedy is aiming for a lower minimum PC spec than usual, but on the opposite end of the spectrum, FBC will also support DLSS4 with multi-frame generation as well as nVidia Reflex and full ray-tracing. It’ll also be Steam Deck verified, and it’s launching into Xbox and PC Game Pass on day one along with PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium. Finally, there is a post-launch content plan that Remedy isn’t ready to share quite yet, and there will be paid cosmetics, but that’s the extent of the microtransactions.\nIn fairness, I haven’t actually played FBC: Firebreak yet, so I have to be cautious about my enthusiasm. But so far, it certainly passes the eye test. This is almost certainly not a run-of-the-mill multiplayer shooter, in a very good way. And the fact that it’s a get-in and get-out online game that doesn’t require a massive ongoing time commitment in order to enjoy it is a refreshing throwback to the days when that was the norm.\nRyan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show,Podcast Unlocked, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show,IGN Unfiltered.

    "title": "Bleach Rebirth of Souls Review in Progress",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-21T21:49:27Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-review",
    "full_text": "Although Bleach is the flashiest member of the shonen anime “big three,” standing shoulder to shoulder with mega-popular series like One Piece and Naruto, it has long suffered from middle child syndrome when it comes to arena fighter adaptations. Bleach Rebirth of Souls aims to break the cycle ofrun-of-the-mill anime fightersthis series has previously been part of, delivering a unique action game that attempts to raise the genre to greater heights. Its story mode is admittedly an uneven jumble, ricocheting back and forth between a laughable attempt at a visual novel cobbled together like a last-second afterthought and a visually striking and stylish spectacle, as Bleach should be. But developer Tamsoft's herculean effort to enrich Rebirth of Souls with complex combat (with some room for improvement) saves it from being just another fly-by-night arena fighter.\n\nIt’s easy to get overloaded by a bunch of confusing anime jargon as Rebirth of Souls’ tutorial explains how its health bar, counters, and super moves work, but here’s the quick way to understand things: This is a 3D arena fighter with Super Smash Bros.’s life stock system, Sekiro’s stance-breaking swordplay, and Bleach’s unique visual flair. Unlike other arena fighters, which often have combat so shallow you only need to find a single combo or spam super moves to win matches, Bleach's combat feels like a challenging game of tug-of-war – one where victories are clinched rather than mindlessly stomped out of your opponents.\nEach sword swing feels snappy and weighty as you teleport around the screen, ambushing your enemies from behind and breaking their guard. It never gets old to see large blocks of text wrap around freeze-framed characters with every successfully landed counter and super move. Even when you play Rebirth of Souls on its Standard Mode button layout, which streamlines things by letting you dish out flashy auto-combos, it harbors a wink of complex and unique mechanics specific to each character that warrant further exploration. That could be Shinji's counter-heavy moveset or the in-your-face brawler style of my personal favorite, Soi Fon – it’s so satisfying to stun lock opponents whenever she zips all over the place with a flurry of punches and kicks. Plus, her super move is a massive missile arm canon that she has hunker down to fire, which is too enticing a contradiction to pass up as a main.\nHowever, Standard Mode matches do have a samey button rhythm to them after a while without much expression outside of mashing light and heavy button combos into a super. Having two move inputs that double as a distance closer alongside often unreliable ranged attacks does not make for a remarkable competitive game. It also doesn't help that the movement feels oddly stiff, with slow dashes and a scarcity of defensive options. Typically, whenever you're getting your ass kicked, fighting games bail you out by filling up your meter that effectively allows you to take some pressure off with a flashy super or counter. Other arena fighters like Naruto and Dragon Ball get around these counter move deficits by giving you a dedicated button to charge your super bars or spend portions of your meter for last second teleportations to avoid disaster.\nIn contrast, outside of two defensive retaliation mechanics called Awakenings and Reversals (with the former activating as a late-game transformation to buff your damage), the only way to build your super move or flash step teleports in Rebirth of Soils is tied to having dealt enough combos in the first place. The limited defensive mechanics grow even more dire when successfully blocking an opponent's offensive onslaught can be immediately undone by them comboing into a guard breaker — which should be virtually unheard of in any self respecting fighting game.\nAll of the above makes the back and forth of Standard Mode matches a bit tiring as you wait for a flash step bar to come back or pray you don't get whiff punished into oblivion thanks to a weird attack range. Thankfully, playing Rebirth of Souls in Manual Mode alleviates a lot of the restrictiveness those training wheels can cause, giving you the ability to mix together (or cancel out of) a variety of light and heavy combos into metered special moves. That makes Manual feel like the “intended” way to play if you’re looking for a more serious fighter because you aren't limited to a light and heavy combo string with the occasional super move punctuation mark. Manual Mode allows you to cancel out combos on a dime and deliver an infinite string of attacks, letting you effectively express yourself as you learn what assortment of attacks will deal the most damage while looking good doing so. That said, it could still do with more optimization to things like sluggish dashes, inconsistent attack range hit confirmations, and a deficit of defensive movements to make matches feel less rigid and constrictive.\nAs a massive fan of the Bleach anime and manga's stunning artistry, stirring character development, and shocking plot twists, I had high hopes that Rebirth of Souls could deliver a worthwhile story mode. Sadly, it's a bit of a mixed bag. By and large, cutscenes in an anime fighter should act as a sparkly reward at the end of battle, meant to bring the momentum of a fight to a thrilling climax. At the best of times, like in theNaruto: Ultimate Ninja Stormseries, they can be so well animated that they could substitute for watching the actual shows. That is not always the case with Rebirth of Souls – if anything, they nearly bring things to a screeching and embarrassing halt where you're not sure if you're meant to laugh on purpose or not.\nThe look of combat clearly had a lot of tender love and care put into it, but the story moments between that action instead play out like a cheap visual novel. Outside of a few pre-rendered cutscenes, the SparkNotes version of the anime this story mode attempts to tell is a rushed, hobbled mess. Instead of being greeted by bombastic scenes where my favorite characters clash, I was met with Machinima-looking animations where in-game models would fart out energy waves at each other and stiffly fall to the ground. Even the emotionally heady scenes lose all sense of tension as its characters move around like clumsy action figures with limited points of articulation in bright, low-poly arenas. What's more, exciting moments like sword clashes and beam struggles lose all of their gravitas as these scenes incessantly cut to black with bright slashes on the screen that look less like a creative choice for dramatic effect and more like a placeholder for an animation that wasn’t added in time.\nIf this was a genuine attempt to resemble a visual novel, it definitely missed the mark, as it feels more like an unfinished first draft – and with review codes less than a day before launch, it’s hard not to see this as an intentional hope that fans will buy-in based solely on the goodwill of the franchise. Which is a shame, because both its English and Japanese voice cast are putting in work with their vocal performances and the character models are faithful recreations that do look great in action. As if Bandai Namco took pointers fromInvincible season 2’s jokeabout how animators cut corners to make more scenes, Rebirth of Souls put all of its focus on the fights, and every moment outside of them looks like a fan-made animator’s first crack at recreating the anime as a result.\nAt the same time, however, Tamsoft is weirdly able to weaponize its limited, awkward looking cutscenes to drive home the charm of Bleach's filler episodes. Moments of levity during a handful of original story mode chapters where characters take a break from slashing each other to play high-stakes games of soccer, go on haunted house dates, or rinse each other at fighting games have the right kind of jank to their slapstick animation. These periodic excursions are disarmingly charming to watch. Side characters who'd otherwise be ignored on Rebirth of Souls roster like Shuhei or Izuru get more dimension to them, encouraging you to invest time in learning how to play them because of how compelling and personable their slice-of-life segments are.\nBleach Rebirth of Souls’ combat surpasses the typical anime arena fighter thanks to its intricate battle system and the effort that has been invested in making each character feel unique with their distinct play styles. Although the theatrics of its story mode do not consistently match the spectacle of its crisp character models, the vibrant sword slashes and stylish typography accompanying each super move help compensate for those shortcomings. Despite not fully delivering on its ambitious promise to elevate anime arena fighters to new heights, Rebirth of Souls is still a welcome latecomer to the genre for this series."

    "title": "Metal Gear Solid: The Board Game Review",
    "publishedAt": "2025-04-01T18:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-board-game-review",
    "full_text": "The story behind the Metal Gear Solid Board Game is nearly as wild as the plot of aMetal Gear game, featuring a mix of delays and licensing issues, with odds stacked against it ever seeing the light of day before being rescued (much like Solid Snake rescuing Gray Fox) by CMON Games. But at long last, this cardboard adaptation of the Hideo Kojima masterpiece has finally reached the masses. From sneaking around in cardboard boxes to dynamic and exciting boss fights, the game’s tactical stealth gameplay has successfully made the jump fromvideo games to board games. However, the whole package isn’t without its faults, leaving me feeling both satisfied and let down at the same time.\n\nMetal Gear Solid: The Board Game is acampaign-style board gamethat retells the story of thefirst Metal Gear Solid game, originally released on the PlayStation in 1998. Designed for one to four players (at least according to the box; more on that below), the game has players move plastic miniature versions of series favorites like Meryl, Otacon, Cyborg Ninja Gray Fox, and Solid Snake himself through 14 scenarios featuring iconic moments from the game, such as the confrontation with Ocelot, changing the PAL Keycard, and, of course, taking out REX.\nUnfortunately, there is one significant omission that didn’t make the cut: the final confrontations between Solid and Liquid are not recreated as playable scenarios. It’s a bummer that neither the barehanded fight on top of REX nor the Jeep escape is included. Perhaps the developers couldn’t find a way to balance or explain a 4v1 battle on REX or figure out how the escape would work with all present characters. Instead, they've opted to end on the high note of a dramatic and memorable team-up against Metal Gear REX. But in the meantime, the fan community around this game has you covered. Over onBoardGameGeek, user @Geoff907and their wife devised and published their own unique Stage 15 for this game for you to try out, if you just absolutely need to get some of that shirtless fist-fight action into your game.\nIf you opt for the more expensive “Integral Edition,” the rest of the story bits that aren't told through gameplay are instead presented in a striking 109-page graphic novel with art by comic artist Kenneth Loh. It's reminiscent of the scenes in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker or the Digital Graphic Novels on PSP. But MGS wouldn’t be MGS without its CODEC calls. These little burst transmissions between Snake and his support team have been faithfully adapted to this new format, with prompts directing players to specific calls in the included Codec Book, as well as pre and post-scenario briefings. I particularly appreciate the care the developers have taken to make them just as campy yet informative as those in the video game. For example, Snake refers to how many actions he can take or offers tips on beating Psycho Mantis involving “Player 2”-like trickery. Even as a game made of cardboard and dice, this still feels distinctly Metal Gear.\nRegarding gameplay, players take up to four actions per turn, chosen from those listed on their character’s unique player boards. As scenarios progress, players unlock new equipment, from Snake’s favorite sidearm, the Socom, to the iconic cardboard box, which can be used in future scenarios. This equipment expands each character’s skill pool, effectively replicating the video game’s “procure on-site” philosophy. Once players take their actions, it’s time for the enemies to act. Both generic guards and bosses have action cards that dictate their movements and behaviors, which can change depending on whether they’ve spotted the player. Guards also have a separate reaction deck used in various situations, such as spotting a knocked-out guard or investigating a noise.\nBoss encounters pose their own unique challenges, forcing you out of your comfort cardboard box and requiring you to think on your feet. Each boss fight feels distinct, from Revolver Ocelot darting around while bouncing bullets off walls to the Hind D having multiple target areas to damage. Thanks to the game’s tile-based nature, each boss fight takes place on a unique, large board with special elements affecting the encounter. For example, in Ocelot’s arena, the injured Kenneth Baker can be hit and killed, adding a new way to trigger a game over. These special tweaks only enhance the excitement and tension of the encounters, as they are rarely designed to favor the players.\nThis element of randomness kept me on my toes, never knowing exactly how far guards would move or which way they’d turn. The added dice rolls for checking if my actions made noise or if enemy shots would hit me resulted in an experience that balanced strategy with luck. There were multiple moments where I held my breath as I pulled a guard movement card, waiting to see if I’d be spotted. I never felt the game was unfair, but I also never expected it to be kind. Metal Gear does a superb job balancing strategy and luck.\nWhile the box suggests the game can be played with up tofour players, at least for the campaign mode, I wouldn’t recommend going beyond two players. Personally, I found playing it as asolo board gameoffered the best experience. Each scenario specifies which of the four playable characters can be used, with the first two scenarios playable only by Snake. Only five scenarios in the entire campaign allow for four players (with no missions designed forthree players), and the first four-player mission doesn’t appear until the ninth scenario.\nFrom a narrative standpoint, this makes sense. It wouldn’t be logical for Snake to infiltrate Shadow Moses with Gray Fox at his side or for Otacon to tackle Vulcan Raven alone. But from a board game perspective, this limitation significantly impacts the experience, making it hard to convince my MGS-loving friends to play when only one of them could participate in most of the game, while the others had to wait for the last few missions. I would have loved to see optional modifiers allowing additional characters intwo-playerscenarios or “What if?” scenarios offering alternate viewpoints and player counts.\nTo the game’s credit, the developers addressed this issue by allowing up to four players in the “VR Missions” mode. This additional mode, which includes its own set of special unlockable equipment cards,\nhas its own caveat: a lack of content. The included VR Missions book features six mission types – Recon, Escape, and Sabotage, among others – but each type has only one associated map layout. While some tokens and traps may change between sessions, and you can swap in a boss model for extra challenge, the guard layouts and objectives remain the same. With the map never changing, once you know what to do, the mode quickly loses its luster. I hope that CMON or the community releases creative and fun new maps and missions to keep things fresh.\nYou can also check out our recent reviews of board games based onDead Cells,S.T.A.L.K.E.R., andElden Ring.\nMetal Gear Solid: The Board Game successfully distills much of the tactical espionage action from the video game into an engaging and challenging board game adaptation. The gameplay and miniatures are the stars of the show, striking a great balance between creativity and strategy. However, restrictions on character selection and player count for most of the campaign make it difficult to play with a full group of friends. When paired with the limited stage options in VR Missions, what could have been a sturdy and impressive cardboard box ends up feeling like one that’s been tossed onto too many FedEx trucks on its way to delivery—functional but slightly battered.\nIf you’re a fan of solo play or want to experience the game with one other person, you’ll find plenty to love. But if you’re looking for a game to play with a group of three or more, you may want to think twice before diving in."

    "full_text": "Sony is working on a new Starship Troopers movie reboot, according to various Hollywood sources.\n\nThe Hollywood Reportersaid District 9, Elysium, and Chappie director Neill Blomkamp has signed on to write and direct a new adaptation of Starship Troopers, the 1959 military sci-fi novel by Robert A. Heinlein.DeadlineandVarietybacked up the report.\nThis new Starship Troopers movie is not a continuation of or related to Paul Verhoeven’s cult classic 1997 sci-fi satireStarship Troopers. Rather it is a new adaptation of Heinlein’s novel, and comes from Sony’s Columbia Pictures.\nNews of Blomkamp’s involvement with this new Starship Troopers movie feels puzzling givenSony itself recently announced a live-action movie of blockbuster PlayStation Studios shooter Helldivers. Arrowhead's Helldivers is heavily inspired by Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers, and sees cannon fodder soldiers tasked with defending a satirized fascist Super Earth regime from alien bugs, among other enemy factions, while preaching Liberty and Managed Democracy to the masses.\nSony now faces the prospect of having new Starship Troopers and Helldivers movies going up against each other, although The Hollywood Reporter said Blomkamp’s take is not a remake of the Verhoeven movie, rather a return to the source material. Heinlein’s book that Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers is based on differs strongly in tone from the film, with many believing it promotes the ideals the film satirizes.\nNeither this new Starship Troopers nor the Helldivers movie has a release window, so it may be some time before we see or hear from either project. Blomkamp’s last film was Sony’s own Gran Turismo, an adaptation of the long-running PlayStation-exclusive driving simulation series.\nPhoto by TriStar Pictures/Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

(You can buy a disc drive later if you change your mind).\nReviewing for IGN, Simon Cardy gave Astro Bot a 9, praising it as one of the most joyful experiences in gaming: \"Astro Bot made me smile from beginning to end. A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive. And while you don’t need a long history with Sony systems to enjoy it, it is especially a delight for those with a piece of PlayStation in their heart as a treasure trove full of playable nostalgia awaits.\"\n\"Taking the PS5 marketing mantra that 'play has no limits' more seriously than you’d expect, Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it.\"\nFor those still on the fence about buying aPS5, this bundle makes for a compelling argument, and it's certainly one of thebest PS5 dealsgoing right now. Astro Bot isn’t just a great game—it’s a celebration of everything PlayStation does best, making it an ideal showcase for Sony’s current gen hardware.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "full_text": "The globe-trotting World of Assassination trilogy of IO Interactive's Hitman series is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 asHitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition. And alongside arriving in the Switch 2 launch window, Agent 47 will also be donning some new, appropriately Nintendo-themed duds.\n\nOnIO Interactive's site, the developer confirmed Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition will go up for pre-order soon, for both digital and physical editions. A pre-order of the digital edition will get you the Signature Pack, which includes two red-and-white outfits for Agent 47, a golden wrench, and a mushroom. Mushroom effects unknown at this time.\nPhysical pre-orders, meanwhile, offer both the Signature Pack and the Quack Pack, which offers a Luigi-themed green-and-grey suit and a green rubber duck. Much like a bald guy in a red tie and suit at a Paris fashion show, nothing unusual to see here.\nLess-than-subtle references aside, it's fun to see Agent 47 get some Nintendo attire. Other games likeBayonettaandThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrimgot their own Nintendo crossover cosmetics, and Agent 47 certainly has earned a bit of Nintendo theming of his own.\nThe World of Assassination spans a trilogy of games, as Agent 47 undertakes a number of missions to assassinate targets and complete contracts for his clientele. Starting with 2016's Hitman, the WoA trilogy runs up through Hitman III, whichIGN gave a 9, saying: \"Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is one of the barcoded butcher's best appearances.\"\nHitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition combines all of it together into one package. This includes the main campaign, contracts mode, escalations, Elusive Target arcades, and featured live content for Hitman, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3. Also included is the Freelancer game mode, a roguelike option for those who want even more variety and options in their Hitman experience.\nCurrently, Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition is due to arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in June 2025. Its also available now on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, the original Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation PS VR2.\nEric is a freelance writer for IGN."

Highlights include a rare discount on a (used) PlayStation Portal accessory, Lenovo-exclusive price drops on PS5 DualSense metallic controllers, the first discount we've seen on the iPad Air with M3 chip, USB Type-C cables for only $2.99 apiece, Destiny-themed SteelSeries gaming headsets, and more.\n\nUsed: Like New Condition\nLooks and functions as if it were new. Moderate packing damage observed during inspection.\nThePlayStation Portalhas never been discounted, but at least you can save on a used one.Amazon Resale(a rebranded Amazon Warehouse) currently has Used: Like New condition PS Portals in stock for only $158.70 shipped. It retails for $199 new, so that's a substantial 20% in savings. A Sony warranty may or may not be included, but Amazon Resale items benefit from the same 30-day return policy you get for buying a new item. We expect this item to sell out pretty quickly.\nLenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code \"PLAY5\" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.\nAmazon is offering a 6-foot INIU USB Type-A to USB Type-C cable for only $2.99 when you apply promo code \"C2ALZ6LN\" during checkout. You can add as many cables as you like and the discount should be applied to each and every cable. These cables are sheathed in nylon braiding for durability and can be used for both data sync and charging (Quick Charge 3.1A compatible). This is a great opportunity to stock up.\nIf you're thinking of jumping on the AMD bandwagon for your next upgrade, now is certainly the right time to do so. Alongside theRyzen 7 9800X3Dwhich debuted earlier this year, AMD has just released its two higher-end Ryzen 9 siblings in the Zen 5 \"X3D\" stack: the9950X3Dis available for $699 and the9900X3Dis available for $599. Collectively, these processors represent the best gaming chips across both Intel and AMD. Pure gamers should go with the 9800X3D and allocate their funds elsewhere; creators with deeper pockets and a penchant for gaming will benefit from the immense performance uplift on the new Ryzen 9 processors thanks to their increased core count and cache.\nThenew iPad Airsits in the middle of Apple’s tablet lineup, with better specs than the baseline iPad, but it’s not as powerful as the iPad Pro. That said, if you need more computing power in a tablet than what the baseline device above offers, the new iPad Air with M3 chip will likely suit you just fine.\nAs you can tell by the name, it has Apple’s powerful M3 chip, and it supports Apple Intelligence, unlike the baseline model. It’s also compatible with a new Magic Keyboard (see it at Apple) that has a row of function keys and a trackpad.\nAs part of its Spring Sale, SteelSeries is taking 40% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets.

Right now, theHP Omen 25L GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super Gaming PChas dropped to $1,399.99 shipped after you apply $50 off coupon code \"HPDAYSPC50\". This is quite easily the lowest price we've seen for a prebuilt RTX 4070 Ti Super gaming desktop.\nAmazon is offering a four-pack ofApple AirTagskeyfinders for only $64.49. That's over $35 off the retail price and only $16.10 for each AirTag. This is a very practical accessory for anyone who owns an iPhone and tends to lose small wearables like wallets, keys, or remotes.\n4TB for $259.99\nSamsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.\nApple's best earbuds are on sale today. Amazon is offering the second generationApple AirPods Prowireless noise-canceling earbuds for only $169.99 shipped, a savings of 32% and the best AirPods deal so far this year. That's about $20 more than theApple AirPods 4 with ANC, down from its usual $70 price premium. Between the two, the AirPods Pro is stillthe superior earbudsbecause it offers better sound quality and noise cancelation.\nYou can grab this 10,000mAh power bank for only $8.99 after you clip the 10% off and 40% off clippable coupons on the product page. We very rarely see 10,000mAh power banks listed for under $10 so grab this one while you can. This will charge a Nintendo Switch from 0% to 100% about 1.9 times.\nFor a limited time, Hulu is offering four months of Disney+ and Hulu Basic (Ad-Supported) Bundle for just $2.99 per month. The normal cost of this subscription is $10.99 per month. This deal only comes around a handful of times per year and worth it for just the Disney+ subscription alone.\nPick up a five pack of USB Type-C cables for a grand total of just $7.96 after you apply promo code \"UNWEXMFD\". That averages out to about $1.59 per cable. Lengths include two 3.3ft, two 6.6ft, and an extra long 10ft cable.

Unlike the higher-end S90D which uses a quantum dot OLED panel (and costs $500 more), the S85D uses a standard W-OLED panel. In terms of image quality, it's directly comparable to the LG B4 OLED TV (which costs $200 more). Since this is a true OLED panel, the S85D boasts near instantaneous response time, near infinite contrast ratio, and true blacks. It's superior to any other panel type for most use cases. For those of you who are concerned with burn-in, it's rarely an issue with OLED TVs; it's more of a concern with computer monitors where static screens (like your desktop) are more common.\nThe Samsung S85D also has the necessary features you'd want in a current-gengaming TV, like HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 120Hz panel forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X.

    "full_text": "A Black Friday deal on one of the best OLED TVs is back. Starting today,AmazonandSamsungare offering the 2024 65\" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV for only $1,399.99 shipped after $1,300 in instant savings. This is anexcellent TV to pair up with your PlayStation 5or Xbox Series X. This TV is considered to as good as or better than the popular LG C4 OLED TV. According toRTINGS, the Samsung S90D is a brighter TV with a wider color gamut, better color volume, wider viewing angle, and better HDR gradient handling.\n\nThe Samsung S90D is the current generation 2024 model. A new \"S90F\" model was announced during CES 2025, but it has yet to be released. This TV is equipped with Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times.\nOLED technology aside, the Samsung S90D also has all the features you'd want in agaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming console. The S90D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to the recently releasedPlaystation 5 Proconsole since it can drive more games in quality mode (native 4K @ 120fps) than the standard PS5, which often needs to be set to performance mode (upscaled 4K).\nIf you're looking for a smaller size, the 42\", 48\", and 55\" models are also on sale. The 42\" model is ideal for PC monitor use. At that screen size, the 4K resolution equates to a respectable 104ppi pixel density and supports chroma 4:4:4 subsampling for clear, legible text. The HDMI 2.1 input supports refresh rates of up to 144Hz over 4K resolution.\nFor this week only, Best Buy is offering the 77\" Samsung S84D 4K OLED smart TV for $1,499.99. That's only $150 more than the 65\" S90D model for a 40% larger screen size. The S84D is Best Buy's exclusive model that's identical to the S85D but with slightly better speakers (30W vs 20W). Compared to the S90D, the S84D is a step down in image quality since it doesn't utilize quantum dot technology and the refresh rate is limited to 120Hz instead of 144Hz. However, it's still an outstanding TV compared to other TVs on the market and an excellent value at this price.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "title": "Capcom Was on Its Knees After Resident Evil 6, Now Monster Hunter Wilds Cements Its Golden Era — Here's How It Did It",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-12T12:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-golden-age-the-rise-and-fall-resident-evil-monster-hunter-wilds",
    "full_text": "With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its wayandits audience.\n\nCapcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.\nBut in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.\n2016 was a bad year for Capcom.\nThe big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.\nThis was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.\nAll of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .\nAchieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.\nCapcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4.\n2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema.\nUnfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.\n“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.\nThis directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op.\nThis downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.\nBut it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.\nThis slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.\nIt was clear something needed to change.\nBy the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability.\nWhile neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.\n“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”\nThose constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6.\n\"We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V,\" Nakayama says. \"And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title.\"\nAll this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards.“There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.\n“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”\nThe team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.\nThere was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master.\n“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.”\nStreet Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series.\nWhile they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.\nWhile Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.\nAround the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience.\n“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”\nIf you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.\n“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”\nItsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance.\nNo other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened.\nFirstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.\n“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”\nMonster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.\nThis created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.\nBut the reality was that Monster Hunterdidhave fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.\nReleased in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.\n“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”\nIt was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”\nIt wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world.\n“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”Tsujimoto says.\nOne important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.\nThis explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.\n“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”\nMonster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call.\n“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&D teams were divided into R&D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”\nTakeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.\nThere were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.\n“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.\nThe game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series.\nBut Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time.\n“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.\nThe result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history.\nNaturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?\nAmpo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”\nBut despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.\nAround the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.\n“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.”\nItsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.\nThe 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. \"Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively,\" Itsuno says. \"When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”\nThis vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should.\nAmpo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, \"So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.”\nThis meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.\n“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”\nSince 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.\nFocusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat.\nBut what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.\nMany of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever.\nWhen asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”\nMonster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”\nMatt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor."

This beloved racing game wasn't just about sating one's velocity requirements while unlocking new whips; lose a High Stakes race, and you'd perma-lose your car. Us launch adopters loved that risk-versus-reward structure and the groundbreaking damage system that would go on to influence the future of racing simulations.\nBetter yet, we had I highly localised Aussie version with Holden VT Clubsport and Ford AU Falcon XR8 featured prominently on the cover. Even cooler, winning the special HSV Pro Cup would unlock Craig Lowndes' MHRT VT Commo'. Using it to evade the fuzz down Durham Road (preferably in split-screen PvP) was mighty boss stuff.\n-Super Star Wars(SNES) 1993.eBay\n-Need for Speed: High Stakes(PS) 1999.eBay\n-Pac-Man Vs.(GC) 2004.Redux\n-Nintendo DSilaunch, 2009.eBay\n-FF Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time(DS) 2009.eBay\nContents\nOver on Nintendo Switch,Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushedis a nostalgic joy, letting you wield a magic paintbrush to reshape the world.

The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Destiny 2 in-game items.\n\nThe SteelSeries Nova 7 is the latest successor to the highly rated Arctis 7 series of headsets. It's every bit as good as its predecessor but with some welcome upgrades like a USB Type-C charging port, a longer battery life (38 hours vs. 30 hours), simultaneous wireless and Bluetooth connectivity, and multi-platform compatibility. PC gamers also have access to the SteelSeries GG app, which opens up a whole suite of customization for your audio. If that's too much for you, there are presets for specific games that are actually tailormade by the game developers. For PS5 gamers, the Nova 7 is also compatible with the PlayStation 5's Tempest 3D Audio.\nThe Arctis Nova 7 is one of thebest headsetsyou can get forPS5and PC. In hisNova 7 review, Matthew Adler wrote that \"SteelSeries continues to push the boundaries of what a headset is capable of. With the addition of simultaneous Bluetooth audio, you can enjoy music, podcasts, or just chat with your friends without losing your game audio – all with a single pair of headphones. The Arctis Nova 7’s new design is sleek, lightweight, and still remains one of the most comfortable headsets I’ve ever used.\" I own a pair of these myself and highly recommend it.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

For those who have been waiting to pick it up, this is a great opportunity to do so at a significant discount, and potentially one of the best deals of the year.\n\nIt's hard to imagine the game dropping any further in price anytime soon, making this likely the best opportunity to buy it at the lowest price possible in 2025. With such a steep discount, I wouldn't be surprising if it sells out quickly, so if you're interested in picking it up, don't wait too long.\nIn our 9/10 review, Michael Higham called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth“a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth,” and “an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long.” While it takes some creative liberties in reimagining the classic, he described it as “thrilling and unexpectedly impactful.”\nWoot, an Amazon-owned online retailer, is known for offering limited-time deals on video games, tech, and more.

    "full_text": "One of the best 55\" OLED TVs is on sale for a limited time. Walmart is offering a55\" Samsung S90C 4K OLED Smart TVfor just $989 with free shipping. Beach Camera is the marketplace vendor and it is an authorized Samsung reseller, which means you get the full manufacturer's warranty. The S90C is a 2023 model, but it's a better TV than the2024 S85Dand nearly identical in image quality to the2024 S90D, which is currently selling for $200 more. Ideally you'll pair it with yourPlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or even theupcoming Switch 2 console.\n\nUpdate:This TV is also available onAmazonfor a little more.\nThe Samsung S90C is a slightly older 2023 model (superseded by theS90Dfor 2024), but it's still considered to be one of the best OLED TVs available. That's because the S90C uses Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. It's generally considered better than LG's \"Evo\" technology found on the C-series TVs, which attempt to do the same thing. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. At the moment, there's no better panel technology that's readily available at a reasonable price.\nOLED technology aside, the Samsung S90C also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz (rare in a 2023 TV) as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X.

Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.\n\n4TB for $259.99\nThe Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.\nThe Samsung 990 Evo Plus does not have a preinstalled heatsink. However, the 990 Evo Plus SSD is a newer single-sided SSD design that is power efficient and doesn't generate as much heat as SSDs from before. That means you probably don't need to use a heatsink and it should still work perfectly fine in a PS5 console without any thermal throttling. That said, you certainly could for peace of mind and I wouldn't see any disadvantage to that aside fromspending an extra $7.\nLooking for more options?

Here’s the official blurb:\nIn its note to press, Studio Wildcard said Ark: Lost Colony “directly connects” the storylines of Ark’s Extinction and Genesis expansions and leads into the events of Ark 2.\nArk 2 is the Unreal Engine 5-powered sequel to the hugely successfulArk Survival Evolved. It was first announced with a surprise Vin Diesel cameo at The Game Awards 2020, at the time with a 2022 release date, but it was later delayed into 2023. Then, earlier in 2023,Ark 2 was delayed again, this time to late 2024 as an Xbox Series X and S console exclusive, day-one on Game Pass, and on PC via Steam and Windows.\nAs recently as December 2023,Studio Wildcard was still insisting Ark 2 was on track for a late 2024 release window. Obviously that didn’t happen, sparking concern from fans. So this announcement, coming three months into 2025, will help reassure fans that Ark 2 is still in the works, although Studio Wildcard failed to provide an updated release window.\nWe do have firmer details for Ark: Lost Colony, however. Pre-orders kick off in June 2025, and all purchases immediately unlock exclusive Ark: Lost Colony preview gameplay content.

Most importantly, sound quality is better than any other headphone in its price range.\n\nSoundGuys recently reviewed the JLab JBuds Luxand gave these headphones an absolutely glowing review, mentioning that they were one of the best headphones under $100.

    "full_text": "Amazon quietly restocked a bunch ofPokémon TCG bundles just days agoand stock is already running low. These Scarlet & Violet sets have been MIA for weeks, and now they’re back at retail prices. I already added a couple to my cart,Surging SparksBooster Bundle,Shrouded FableETB and Paldean Fates Booster Bundle. Trainers need to snap these up quick. If they’re gone by the time you get there, that’s on you.\n\nLooking for the least expensive PlayStation 5 console you can your hands on? As part of its US Anniversary Sale, AliExpress is offering an importedSony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Editiongaming console for $367.94 shipped after $80 off coupon code \"MAYUE008\". This is a brand new and retail boxed product that is stocked in a US warehouse and qualifies for local delivery, which means it ships free and arrives within about 1-2 weeks.\nI also spotted a couple of power banks on sale from INIU and Anker. If you’ve ever watched your phone die mid-flight or mid-text, you know why I’m excited. These things are cheap, fast, and less annoying than asking strangers for a charger at an airport. Do with that information what you will. Oh, and while we’re on the topic of things I absolutely don’t need but definitely want: theGamera: Attack of Legionaction figure is up for preorder at the IGN Store for a cool $560, and Humble Bundle just dropped a massiveDragonlance book bundlethat practically dares you to add 25+ fantasy novels to your backlog for the price of lunch.\nI want this bundle purely for the thrill of cracking six packs in a row and pretending I’m building a deck for Worlds. The Surging Sparks expansion is still new enough to feel fresh, and at $45.02, it’s a decent value compared to scalper prices that make you question your financial decisions. If you just want to dip into the latest set without going full collector mode, this is it.\nShiny Pokémon are back, and apparently so is my addiction to them. The Paldean Fates bundle gives you six chances to pull something sparkly, and while $69.94 isn’t exactly pocket change, I think the potential dopamine hit is worth the gamble. It’s in stock, it ships fast, and I’ve made worse choices at 2 a.m. on eBay.\nI’m not saying this is the nerdiest thing you can buy today, but it’s definitely on the leaderboard. Humble Bundle just dropped a massive Dragonlance collection; 25+ books for about the cost of lunch. If you’ve ever wanted to get lost in magical twin drama, cursed artifacts, or the politics of dwarves (because who hasn’t), this is your sign. Plus, part of your purchase supports Room to Read, so now your TBR pile can come with good karma.\nIn my opinion, this is the one to grab if you're all-in on the set. Nine booster packs, a Pecharunt promo, themed sleeves, dice, and an actually-useful storage box? For $54.96? I’ve spent more on less at Taco Bell. Plus, it's still Prime eligible, which means you don’t have to sell your soul for free shipping. Win-win.\nThis is what happens when you give kaiju collectors exactly what they want: a 9.5-inch figure of LEGION fromGamera 2, complete with flying parts, glowing bits, and articulation that would make Spider-Man jealous. Sure, it’s $560, but I’ve seen statues half as cool go for double that. If you’re the kind of person who rearranges shelf space for something before buying it, I totally get it.\nThis thing charges your phone like it’s got something to prove. At $26.98, it gives you a full week’s worth of backup power and a built-in flashlight just in case you drop your phone and your dignity under your car seat. I want it purely because it has an LED readout that makes me feel like I’m operating a mission control panel instead of just charging my AirPods.\nI think this is the best deal of the day, and not just because it’s $17.99. It’s slim, light, and can survive a drop better than my will to stay off social media. Anker knows what it’s doing, and this charger just works. No random overheating, no mystery ports, just plug it in and keep scrolling through whatever app is currently ruining your sleep schedule.\nHulu + Live TVoffers a three-day free trialthat allows you to take the live TV streaming service for a spin. This is one of the overallbest streaming free trialsbecause it gets you a bundle of services. It is quite a bit shorter than the standard Hulu free trial of 30 days, but it's a great way to test it out over the weekend.\nWith a 240Hz refresh rate, Dual QHD resolution, and 0.03ms response time, this 49-inch ultrawide OLED is built for high-performance PC gaming. The 1800R curve and HDR True Black 400 make it incredibly immersive, while FreeSync Premium Pro helps keep gameplay smooth and responsive.\nThis Android tablet comes with an S Pen included, a 10.4-inch display, and Samsung DeX for multitasking. At under $200, it’s a solid pick for casual gamers, students, or anyone who wants a lightweight, entertainment-ready tablet with productivity perks.\nCelebrate Women's History Month with a killer bundle featuring female-led games. Titles include Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, Control: Ultimate Edition,Darksiders III,Beyond: Two Souls, and more. It’s a $160+ value for just $12, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity.\nWith a whopping 10,000Pa of suction, self-refilling, self-emptying, sonic mopping, and even hot-air mop drying, the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra takes hands-off cleaning to the next level. It's packed with AI features and even supports pet tracking and video calls.\nAmazon’s newest Kindleadds color to the mix with a 7\" Colorsoft display. It still lasts up to 8 weeks on a single charge and now supports wireless charging and full-color highlights. It's ideal for reading graphic novels, cookbooks, or anything where visuals matter.\nEnjoy spatial audio, active noise canceling, and up to 40 hours of battery life. These over-ear headphones are compatible with both iOS and Android, and support lossless audio over USB-C. A strong option for commuters, creators, and music lovers.\nThis Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code \"IFPRZAZ\" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16\" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.\n$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.\nI think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.\nIf you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.\nAt $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.\n$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.\nThis speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.\nCrisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.\nThis speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.\nBass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.\nXM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.\nA wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.\nMy living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.\nI didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.\nThis TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.\nI want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.\nThis one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "full_text": "Having launched in 2019, Apple TV+ is one of the youngest streaming services available today. Over the years, the Apple-owned platform has grown into a powerhouse of original TV shows, likeTed LassoandSeverance, as well as movies likeKillers of the Flower Moon. While it may not release new content at the same pace as something like Netflix, Apple TV+ is only a fraction of the price and comes bundled with just about every new Apple device purchase, making it easier than ever to check out its growing library. Below, we'll break down what Apple TV+ is as a service, how much it costs, and how to sign up for a free trial.\n\nApple TV+ offers a 7-day free trial for all new subscribers. Simply head over to theApple TV+ homepageor app and you'll be greeted with a button that says \"Accept Free Trial.\" NewiPhones,iPads, Apple TVs, and Mac computers also come bundled with a 3-month Apple TV+ trial, which requires manual activation through the Apple TV app on the device. In both cases, once your trial ends, your subscription will automatically renew at the standard monthly rate of $9.99/month.\nApple TV+ is an award-winning streaming service featuring Apple Originals — exclusive series, movies, documentaries, and more, with new content added every month. While it was a bit barebones when it launched in 2019, Apple TV+ has grown its library to over 180 series, with breakout hits like Ted Lasso, Severance, and Silo, as well as over 80 original films, including Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. Apple TV+ was also thefirst streaming service to receive an Academy Award for its original film CODA, which released in 2022.\nWhile Apple TV+ may not boast a massive library like Netflix, it's long maintained a \"quality over quantity\" approach when it comes to its original programming with something that will surely appeal to just about anyone, regardless of age.\nApple TV+ is one of the least-expensive streaming services at $9.99/month.Since there's no ads by default, there's no ad-supported or limited tiers to worry about.\nAside from standalone subscriptions, Apple TV+ is included in a bundled service calledApple One. The lowest-tier Apple One plan gives you access to four subscriptions: Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and a 50GB iCloud+ plan, all for $19.95/month. The Premier Apple One plan costs $37.95/month, adding Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, and an upgrade to 2TB of iCloud+ storage.\nIf you're a current college or university student, you can sign up for aApple Music plan that includes Apple TV+at a discounted rate of $5.99/month. Apple Music usually costs $10.99/month on its own, so this is quite the deal.\nTreated as a separate subscription, Apple TV also hosts Major League Soccer streams. TheMLS Season Passstarts at $14.99/month, and Apple TV+ subscribers get a $2 discount.\nApple TV+ is available to stream on all of your Apple devices including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV set-top boxes. Additionally, you can stream Apple TV+ on a variety of internet-connected smart TVs, Roku devices, Amazon Fire TV devices, Google TV devices, as well as PlayStation and Xbox consoles. You can also AirPlay from an Apple device to any compatible AirPlay device that doesn't feature the native Apple TV+ app.\nFor more streaming platform guides, check out 2025Hulu Subscriptions,Netflix Plans,ESPN+ Plans, andDisney+ Plans.\nMatthew Adler is a Commerce, Features, Guides, News, Previews, and Reviews writer for IGN.

    "full_text": "The weekend is officially here, and we've rounded up the best deals you can find! Discover the best deals for Saturday, March 29, below:\n\nDragon Quest III HD-2D Remake takes the beloved NES game to brand-new heights using HD-2D.  For $40, this is an excellent deal and the lowest we've seen the game yet. I spent 70 hours obtaining the Platinum Trophy for this one on PlayStation 5, so you can expect a giant adventure ahead.\nThis weekend, you can save over $100 off the Logitech G915 TKL Lightspeed Keyboard. This wireless mechanical keyboard is perfect for any setup, with a wide variety of customization options available. You can expect around 40 hours of battery with one full charge, with low profile mechanical switches to deliver faster speed and accuracy with each key press.\nWhy buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.\nAce Attorney Investigations Collection brought both Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth and Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit in one package, with Prosecutor's Gambit releasing in English for the very first time. This release features updated visuals, new animations, gallery mode, conversation history, and more. You can even switch between the old and new sprites!\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth is $32.99 at Woot right now, making this the lowest we've ever seen the RPG. The massive adventure across the planet to track Sephiroth was one of the biggest games of 2024, and it's absolutely a must-play game. A 40+ hour main story awaits, with over 35 side quests available after you clear the story.\nWorld of Goo 2 was a sequel many thought would never happen, but it at last arrived on Nintendo Switch last year after 16 years. This weekend at Amazon, you can take home a physical copy of the game for just $24. Over 60 new levels are featured in this installment, with dozens of new music tracks, too.\nStudio Ghibli has produced many of the most beloved anime films ever, and Kiki's Delivery Service is a prime example. If you wish to experience this film in a new way, the Kiki's Delivery Service Film Comic: All-in-One Edition is a great way to do so! This hardcover book contains the entire film across 584 pages - perfect for any Ghibli fan.\nFinally, Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is just $11 for the PS4 version. This release packs in a total of 300 stages, recreating all levels from Super Monkey Ball Deluxe. If you've never played a Super Monkey Ball game before, Banana Mania is a great place to start, especially for only $11."

    "title": "Deals For Today: Amazon International Solves Pokémon TCG Shortage With Massive Restocks",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-21T15:45:00Z",

    "full_text": "I didn’t think we’d see a proper Pokémon TCG restock this early in 2025. Honestly, I was betting on summer at best, but here we are with actual product showing up on Amazon and not behind some sketchy paywalled Discord server. While the internet’s currently losing its mind over Prismatic Evolutions and burning money chasing stock alerts for Rival Destinies, the smart play is scooping up the older sets that just hit Amazon Global. We’re talking Scarlet and Violet era stuff, Sword and Shield throwbacks, and boxes that were basically extinct six months ago.\n\nThis is the kind of flood the TCG community needed. Not just for collectors trying to complete sets, but for anyone who’s tired of battling bots for ETBs like it’s the Hunger Games. There’s a real mix available right now: Booster Bundles, Premium Collections, tins with actual storage value. And yes, even a few deals that make it feel like Amazon’s trying to keep the vibe positive. If you’re chasing big pulls like Greninja SIR or Pikachu ex SIR, or just need to stock up on sleeves and dice, this is the best stock refreshes we’ve seen in a while.\nAliExpress is currently offering theSony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphonesfor only $225.18 after coupon code:IFP7FJZis applied during checkout. This product is stocked in a US warehouse, so it ships free and arrives within about a week. This is an import model with a warranty that won't be honored in the United States. AliExpress makes up for it with a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days.\nIn our glowingSony WH1000XM5 review, Kevin Lee wrote that \"The Sony WH-1000XM5 is hands down the best sounding and most impressive noise-canceling headphones around. They demand a high premium but the cost of audio excellence is well worth it with this pair of headphones.\"\nThe real deal here is the fact that theTwilight MasqueradeElite Trainer Box is actually in stock. Seeing it available without a 200% markup or sketchy third-party seller feels borderline miraculous. You’re getting nine booster packs, a full-art Teal Mask Ogerpon promo, and all the usual ETB goodies like energy cards, condition markers, and themed sleeves.\nIt’s not every day you seeBrilliant StarsBuild and Battle Boxes in stock, let alone without having to navigate the wild west of resale sites. At $63.34, this one comes with four booster packs and a pre-release promo card, which makes it a solid pickup for collectors looking to flesh out their Sword and Shield era sets. Arceus VSTAR headlines the expansion, and the pull potential here still holds up.\nAmong Us 4-Pack on Steam is a sneaky little deal that gives you four copies of the game for the price of one, making it dangerously easy to rope your friends into a night of trust issues and vent-related betrayal. It supports cross-platform play, customizable settings, and chaotic emergency meetings that usually end with the wrong person getting ejected. If you’ve somehow missed the social deduction chaos, now’s the perfect time to catch up and take three crewmates down with you.\nTheHisuian Electrode V Boxis back in stock at Amazon for $42.45, which is a win considering how sporadically these pop up. It's one of those V boxes that slipped under the radar when it first launched, but now that Sword and Shield-era product is drying up it’s worth grabbing. You get a foil Hisuian Electrode V promo, a regular Electrode foil, an oversized version (because why not), and four booster packs to rip through.\nThis limited-edition snack box is a flavor-packed tribute toAssassin’s Creed Shadows, blending premium Japanese treats with collectible game merch in a way that feels like an edible side quest. You get 15 unique snacks, a full bag of exclusive Kit Kats, a custom Tenugui towel, and even an in-game item called The Hourglass that’s only available through this box. With artwork prints, a detailed snack guide, and a box sleeve that transforms into a display-worthy poster, it’s more than just snacks.\nSeeing theShining FatesPikachu V Box on Amazon again feels like spotting a shiny in the wild. At $49.96 it’s not exactly a steal, but having it in stock is the real value. This box comes with a foil Pikachu V promo, an oversized version for flair, and four Shining Fates booster packs. That means a legit shot at pulls from one of the most hype-filled sets of the Sword and Shield era.\nTheSurging SparksBooster Bundle is actually in stock at Amazon for $47.95, which is kind of a miracle considering how fast this set’s been disappearing. You get six booster packs from the newest Scarlet and Violet expansion, which includes some major chase cards like Pikachu ex SIR and Latias ex. If you missed the chaos of launch day or couldn’t snag a bundle without battling bots, this is your chance to catch up.\nI want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.\nThis phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.\nI can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.\nRimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.\nThis SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.\nI never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.\nI think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.\nApple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.\nBeats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art. The remastered soundtracks, modernized UI, and quality-of-life improvements bring these classics into the modern age while keeping their original charm intact. Each game features iconic character designs by Kazuko Shibuya and a faithful soundtrack rearranged by Nobuo Uematsu. Whether you’re reliving the golden age of RPGs or playing them for the first time, this bundle is the ultimate way to experience Final Fantasy’s roots. The limited-time sale price of $52.49, down from $74.99, makes this an easy win for any RPG fan.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experience Final Fantasy I through VI in glorious HD pixel art.

Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.\nIf you’re tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.\nWhy buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.\nIf you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.\nStill using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.\nThese aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.\nThese Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.\nLuxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.\nThis isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.\nFor those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says \"powerful Pokémon\" like an angry robot penguin).\nI'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.\nIf somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.\nYour PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).\nIf you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, \"I really need to delete some games,\" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.\nLogitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.\nSamsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room. The Acoustic Lens Subwoofer ensures deep, punchy bass, while Adaptive Sound and Game Mode Pro make sure everything from dialogue to explosions sounds crisp. At $764 off, this is the cheapest we’ve seen it outside of Black Friday.\nLG B4 OLED TVbrings incredible picture quality at a price that doesn’t require selling a kidney. It features Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, an α8 AI Processor that automatically enhances whatever you’re watching, and LG’s latest webOS for easy access to streaming apps and over 300 free LG Channels. Gamers get Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and VRR, plus four HDMI 2.1 ports. At $499.99, this is one of the best deals for an OLED right now.\nSamsung’s S90D OLED TVis a beast, packing AI-powered 4K upscaling, Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for silky smooth gameplay, and Dolby Atmos for immersive sound. Real Depth Enhancer makes everything look more lifelike, and PANTONE validation ensures accurate color reproduction. At $300 off, this is a great price for a high-end 65” OLED TV.\nSony’s WH-CH520 headphonesoffer 50 hours of battery life, customizable sound settings, and a lightweight, comfortable design. Multipoint connection makes switching between devices seamless, and DSEE upscaling improves compressed audio. At just $35.95, these are one of the best budget wireless headphones out there today.\nGoogle’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 bring top-tier noise cancellation, a Tensor A1 chip for AI-powered audio enhancements, and large 11mm drivers for rich bass. Conversation Detection automatically switches to transparency mode when you talk, so you don’t have to take them out. If you need premium wireless earbuds, this is asolid deal for these 9/10 buds.\nEnshrouded is a survival RPG with deep crafting, intense combat, and massive co-op potential. Play solo or team up with up to 16 friends, build custom bases, and fight through a dark, mysterious world. It’s still in early access, but at $23.99, it’s worth jumping in now aswe gave it 8/10.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "title": "Netflix Says Kids Don't Care About Consoles: '8-Year-Olds Aren’t Dreaming of PlayStation 6'",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-28T18:05:18Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-says-kids-dont-care-about-consoles-8-year-olds-arent-dreaming-of-playstation-6",
    "full_text": "Netflix's President of Games, Alain Tascan, is expecting a future generation that relies less on gaming consoles as major players like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo push forward with new hardware.\n\nThe lead of the streaming giant’s video game division shared his thoughts on how gaming fans might soon play their favorite titles during an interview withThe Game Businessthat took place following a Netflix presentation in San Francisco. During the event itself, Tascan was asked if the streamer had any intention of taking a crack at console gaming, but he’s not so sure younger gamers are even interested in what something like a PlayStation 6 could bring to the table.\n“[When it comes to] console, we started to look at the future where the platform is agnostic,” he explained. “Look at the younger generation. Are eight year-olds and 10 year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6? I am not sure. They are wanting to interact with any digital screen, whatever it is, wherever it is, even in the car. With console you’re thinking about high definition, you’re thinking about the controller […] If we look at this older model, I think it will restrain us.”\nTascan told The Game Business that he’s got a soft spot for console gaming despite his concerns, specifically calling out Nintendo’s Wii as a personal favorite. He’s spent many years at studios such as EA, Ubisoft, and Epic Games in the past, so the idea of more traditional console game releases is far from foreign for him. For Netflix, though, things are trending in a different direction.\nWhile the company has a proven track record for creating game adaptations for its IPs with subscription add-ons like Stranger Things 3: The Game, Too Hot to Handle: Love Is a Game, and more, it’s also experimented with giving users access to notable, familiar games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition. Each game can be played straight from a mobile phone if a subscriber chooses, and as Tascan clarified during that recent event, Netflix will be doubling down on this strategy as it develops party games and establishes itself as a hub for kids and gamer families.\n“I am very vigorous about lowering friction and eliminating it if we can,” he told The Game Business. “I see that the subscription is friction as well. Maybe good friction because it makes business sense, but still we did the test of eliminating subscription for [mobile game] Squid Game: Unleashed. And we may do other tests.”\nHe continued: “But the other friction is having enough controllers for family. Having a piece of hardware that might be expensive, that’s another friction. Waiting for a game to download, that’s another friction. I am [looking at] all the obstacles, and asking if we can reduce them as much as possible.”\nNetflix said in early 2024 that games engagement had tripled throughout 2023, signaling that it would continue investing in the space in the future after a 2021CNBCreport suggestedless than 1% of subscribers were tapping into its gamesofferings. In October 2024, the streaming giant cut back on its gaming ambitions when itshut down its AAA studio headed by former Overwatch, Halo, and God of War developers. AGame Developerreport from last month said cuts had also recently hit Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, a teamNetflix picked up in 2021.\nAs Netflix seeks to tap into a market that it expects to be uninterested in game consoles, there’s little reason to doubt we’ll see something like aPlayStation 6ornext Xboxfrom Sony and Microsoft, respectively. Nintendo, meanwhile, is teetering on the edge of a brand-new console generation with itshighly anticipated Switch 2 device. It will pull back the curtain on its new tech with a focused Direct presentation next week, with many fans expecting to hear more aboutwhat features the Switch 2 brings to the table, its release date, andhow pre-orders are being handled.\nPhoto by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images.\nMichael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

A new storage system has 10 times the capacity of the regular Palbox. Not only can guild members access it, but it can be used as a personal storage with private settings.\nElsewhere, you can now change your character’s appearance without affecting armor stats (transmog), there’s a photo mode, blueprint upgrading, and dedicated servers for Mac, among other changes detailed in the patch notes below.\nDeveloper Pocketpair said it’s working on adding dedicated servers for the PlayStation 5 version and will release them at some point in the future.\nPalworld has had an incredible32 million playerssince its early access launch in January 2024. The studio haslaid out a content roadmap for Palworld's 2025that looks fairly lengthy; alongside crossplay, there is an \"ending scenario\" and more new content on the way for the hugely popular creature-catching survival game.\nPalworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC a year ago, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developercouldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success,signing a deal with Sonyto form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP, and launching the game on PS5.\nLooming over all this isa lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, who seek \"an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages\" on the grounds that Palworld has allegedly infringed on \"multiple\" patent rights.Pocketpair has provided an update, identifying the patents the studio is allegedly infringing, and it has since tweaked how players summon Pals in Palworld, apparently in response. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in court, saying: “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”\n▼New Content・Crossplay!⤷ Cross-play is now available across all platforms.・Global Palbox⤷ Store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds!・Dimensional Pal Storage⤷ A new storage system with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox!

Ultimately, instead of Hill’s Seth keysmashing his controller and yelling at the TV screen when he died in-game, Michael Cera’s character Evan can be seen playingThe Getaway: Black Mondayon PS2 in that scene. But fun fact: there’s actually a bit of a gag with one of Cera’s lines here. He mentions using an M16 assault rifle in the game — but The Getaway: Black Monday, a British cop game, doesn’t even include them in the weapons arsenal. Go figure.\nRogen was at SXSW to promote his new Apple TV+ seriesThe Studio, which had its world premiere at the festival just days ago.\nSuperbad also starred Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Emma Stone, alongside memorable cameos from Bill Hader and Rogen himself.

    "publishedAt": "2025-03-20T17:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-march-20-2025",
    "full_text": "Samsung came in strong with today’s deals, and I have to admit, I’m eyeing a couple of them up.The 49-inch Odyssey G9 gaming monitorlooks like something pulled straight from a sci-fi movie.The Galaxy Tab S10+ 5Gis basically a laptop in disguise, and theGalaxy Z Flip 6is making flip phones cool again. If that’s not enough, theS24 Ultrais here to remind every other smartphone who’s boss, and theSSD dealsare giving me a solid excuse to finally clean up my storage situation.\n\nSome of these discounts are impressive, like$500 off that insane QD-OLED monitor. Others, like theSonic statueandRimWorld deal, are more like little bonus treats for the fans. Either way, if you’ve been waiting for a solid sale on a gaming monitor, a high-end phone, or a storage upgrade, Samsung has something worth looking at today.\nAliExpress has brand new PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch OLED consoles on sale for prices you won't find anywhere else. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming console that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by youraccount, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item.\nI want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.\nThis phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.\nI didn’t know I needed an 11-inch Sonic statue until now. The detail is impressive, the LED lights make it pop, and it’s half off. If you’re a Sonic fan, this is an easy yes. If you’re not, well, now’s a great time to start.\nI can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.\nRimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.\nThis SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.\nI never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.\nI think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.\nApple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.\nBeats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art. The remastered soundtracks, modernized UI, and quality-of-life improvements bring these classics into the modern age while keeping their original charm intact.

It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.\nWhy buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.\nIf you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.\nStill using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.\nThese aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.\nThese Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.\nLuxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.\nThis isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.\nFor those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says \"powerful Pokémon\" like an angry robot penguin).\nI'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.\nIf somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.\nYour PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).\nIf you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, \"I really need to delete some games,\" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.\nLogitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.\nSamsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room. The Acoustic Lens Subwoofer ensures deep, punchy bass, while Adaptive Sound and Game Mode Pro make sure everything from dialogue to explosions sounds crisp. At $764 off, this is the cheapest we’ve seen it outside of Black Friday.\nLG B4 OLED TVbrings incredible picture quality at a price that doesn’t require selling a kidney. It features Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, an α8 AI Processor that automatically enhances whatever you’re watching, and LG’s latest webOS for easy access to streaming apps and over 300 free LG Channels.

At $499.99, this is one of the best deals for an OLED right now.\nSamsung’s S90D OLED TVis a beast, packing AI-powered 4K upscaling, Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for silky smooth gameplay, and Dolby Atmos for immersive sound. Real Depth Enhancer makes everything look more lifelike, and PANTONE validation ensures accurate color reproduction. At $300 off, this is a great price for a high-end 65” OLED TV.\nSony’s WH-CH520 headphonesoffer 50 hours of battery life, customizable sound settings, and a lightweight, comfortable design. Multipoint connection makes switching between devices seamless, and DSEE upscaling improves compressed audio. At just $35.95, these are one of the best budget wireless headphones out there today.\nGoogle’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 bring top-tier noise cancellation, a Tensor A1 chip for AI-powered audio enhancements, and large 11mm drivers for rich bass. Conversation Detection automatically switches to transparency mode when you talk, so you don’t have to take them out. If you need premium wireless earbuds, this is asolid deal for these 9/10 buds.\nEnshrouded is a survival RPG with deep crafting, intense combat, and massive co-op potential.

    "full_text": "I think today might be the day my wallet throws in the towel. Woot is coming in hot with one of thebest PS5 game dealsI’ve seen all year, and Sony’s decided we’ve all earned a full-blown audio upgrade. Between the markdowns onnoise-canceling headphones,portable speakers, andhome theater gear, it's giving \"treat yourself\" energy with \"I won’t regret this at all\" delusion.\n\nI want at least three of these, but I’m pretending to be financially responsible and only putting two in my cart. If you’ve been eyeballing anything fromhigh-end headphonestosmart display cases for your action figures (I meancollectibles), now’s probably the best time to stop window shopping and start adding to your cart.\nThis Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code \"IFPRZAZ\" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16\" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.\n$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.\nI think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.\nIf you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.\nAt $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.\n$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.\nThis speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.\nCrisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.\nThis speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.\nBass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.\nXM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.\nA wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.\nMy living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.\nI didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.\nThis TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.\nI want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.\nThis one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.\nIf you're searching for your next new game to play,Humble Choice Marchis now live, and this is the perfect bundle to discover something new! This month, Homeworld 3 headlines the bundle, with other PC games like Wild Hearts, Pacific Drive, Zau, and Gravity Circuit also included. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars to grab these games individually, you can get all eight games for just $11.99 at Humble Bundle for this month only.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-will-be-nintendos-best-console",
    "full_text": "This is a guest column fromNintendo Life, the world’s most-visited independent Nintendo website. It covers the world of Nintendo from all angles: the games, hardware, and history with in-depth reviews and features, and also the fan community, culture, and conversation that’s formed around gaming’s most beloved company and characters.\n\nFor Nintendo fans the world over, time seems to be passing slower than ever. Sincethe January revealof Switch 2 (the official Nintendo one, notthe leaksweeks before) we've all been crossing days off the calendar counting down tothe April Nintendo Direct, when we'll finally get a proper deep dive at the hardware, a look at new games, and perhaps even a release date. Well, hopefully.\nRavenous as we are for solid Switch 2 details — ones that don't come from coverage-hungry case manufacturers or a 17-second peek of a newMario Kart— there's one I’m confident of: from day one, Switch 2 will be the ultimate Nintendo console.\nI can already sense some '?' Blocks popping off but hear me out – even at this early stage it's hard to argue that Switch 2 won't be the ultimate portal for Nintendo games past, present, and future.\nIt's largely thanks to Nintendo Switch Online and the huge, historic catalogue steadily assembled sinceSeptember 2018. You get access to 182 games with a regular sub, or a whopping 290 with the 'Expansion Pack'. It’s not just Nintendo games either, the 47-strong selection ofSEGA Mega Drive/Genesis gamescovers some of that system's absolute best too. Plus the rubbishVirtua Fighter 2port.\nHey, they can't all be winners, but from classics to cult curios (seriously, check out the late-cycleSutte Hakkunfor Super Famicom if you haven't already), NSO is a vast buffet of historical video game nuggets served on a single handy device, a perfect introduction for younger gamers unfamiliar with the olden days. Grizzled vets can baulk at the idea of whippersnappers not having playedYoshi's IslandorOcarina of TimeorGoldenEye>Bunker>Power Weapons - no Oddjob, but time marches on and it's only natural. NSO's boon is offering so many iconic, formative games on a platter. We can debate the quality of the emulation (and we have), butthe library is impressive, despite gaps, and it's still growing.\nThat's all before we get to backwards compatibility with the current console; its lineup of series-bests should almost all be playable on the new Switch. Calls of recency bias will ring out for a generation or two yet, but the towering quality ofBreath of the Wildand its direct sequel Tears of the Kingdom,Super Mario OdysseyandSuper Mario Bros. Wonder,Animal Crossing: New Horizons,Splatoon 3,Pikmin 4, theMetroids, theXenoblades,and more is undeniable. If they're not the pinnacle of their respective series, they're in the conversation, and they'll all almost definitely be playable on Switch 2.\nBut what about third parties? What about indies?The specifics are hazy at this stage, but we're assuming that everything's coming over, so historians can still access Hamster's enormousArcade Archivesseries and Digital Eclipse's masterful work on various collections, not to mention its excellentGold Masterline.\nThe vast ocean of incredible indie games should speak for itself at this stage; one of Nintendo's greatest strengths this gen has been fully embracing the community of smaller devs. More surprisingly, Switch has also held its own with larger third-party devs, too, and signs point to that support expanding on Switch 2, and that includes games from other platform holders.\nSwitch isn't far off becoming a brilliantPlayStation history lesson, and even first-party Sony is starting to turn up withMLBandLEGO Horizon. Throw in potential support from Microsoft withCall of Dutyandrumours of other ports, plus the wider world of modern games and other firms eager to mitigate rising production costs across multiple platforms, and we're entering an era of unprecedented cross-platform support. Another win for anybody with a Switch 2.\nThere's also the small matter of whatever Nintendo's got bubbling on the stove in its Kyoto kitchens. Internal devs have been beavering away while partner studios have handled most first-party output since Mario Wonder. I'm expecting the biggest hitters on Nintendo's bench to come out swinging in April. A 3D Mario, naturally (it's the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros., remember), but anything except a full-blown 3D Zelda is possible. And there area couple of potential Wii U portsthat could tide us over nicely in the Hylian department, too.\nSwitch sales have slowed dramaticallyin the last year- not unexpectedly considering the system's age (it's going into itsninthyear in March). As any Captain F. Obvious can tell you, Nintendo needs the energy, excitement, and profit that new hardware generates, but day-one demand is likely to be colossal. Stockpiling inventory makes eminent sense, even ifanalysts, investors, and fans alikeare gagging for it ASAP.\nCould the next mainline Mario be total toilet? Of course. Past evidence suggests it'll probably be quite good, though, and Switch 2 will likely have other quite good games. Nintendo's software batting average isquite good.\nEven considering that history, though, Switch is the only console I remember buying on launch day. I got a Wii in its first month, but I'd never walked out of a store carrying the new hotness on the very first day before. It worked out rather well but a day-one purchase felt like a real gamble given the fate of Wii U, even for a card-carrying Nintendophile desperate to play BOTW on the bus.\nConversely,thisNintendo console feels like the surest possible bet for fans of the medium, even knowing practically nothing about its launch lineup. The historical library that took years to build up on previous systems is all just going to be there!\nWell, almost all. As Nintendo hasmentioned(though not yet detailed), there will be\"exceptions\". A background graphic on its website showsvarious games presumably playable; the likelihood is that onlyoutliersemploying peripherals and modes involving the IR sensor will be technically incompatible. Pour one out forLabo.\nBeyond that, all signs point to Switch 2 being a brilliantly comprehensive overview of Nintendo history from launch day. Despite many unanswered questions, and not forgetting my professional obligation to get involved from the beginning (a golden excuse, granted), the possibility of buyer's remorse has never been lower for a Nintendo console. I've never been more eager to get stuck in on day one.\nWhenever that is.\nGavin Lane is the Editor at Nintendo Life. He’s been flying the Nintendo flag since the 8-bit days.

    "url": "https://br.ign.com/the-first-berserker-khazan/138196/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-e-um-soulslike-intenso-para-o-bem-e-para-o-mal-review",
    "full_text": "Um dos gêneros mais populares e importantes dos videogames na última década foi o soulslike. Encabeçado pela FromSoftware e títulos como Dark Souls, Bloodborne e, mais recentemente, Elden Ring, essa categoria derivada dos RPGs de ação reverbera sucessos há 10 anos. Para embarcar nessa onda, a desenvolvedora Neople e a publicadora Nexon criaram The First Berserker: Khazan, novo soulslike baseado no universo do aqui no Brasil quase desconhecido Dungeon Fighter Online, que deixa as raízes de Dark Souls de lado para se inspirar em Nioh e nos soulslikes da Team Ninja.\nDurante as minhas mais de 35 horas de jogo, pude encontrar muitas qualidades no combate e construção de builds baseadas nos inúmeros itens que podemos combinar, mas me senti extremamente entediado com um level design fraco, uma repetição de inimigos no mínimo esquisita e personagens desinteressantes. The First Berserker: Khazan é um jogo muito intenso para o bem e para o mal, mas consegue demonstrar proeminência naquilo que se propõe a ser: um soulslike desafiador.\nCom uma narrativa um tanto quanto comum em histórias de brucutus em busca de vingança, o jogo segue esse mesmo caminho e nos apresenta Khazan, um poderoso general do império de Pell Los, que é condenado injustamente e exilado para montanhas nevadas por traição ao imperador. No entanto, o acaso do destino faz com que ele seja “salvo” por um espírito maligno que o possui e assim começa uma longa jornada de vingança. A premissa é bastante básica, mas a extensão do universo faz com que a narrativa ganhe camadas de profundidade, embora nenhuma delas consiga tornar o enredo cativante de verdade.\nMesmo com reviravoltas mirabolantes, a trama de traição se mantém clichê do início ao fim e em diversos momentos é sonolenta. Os personagens de suporte também são imemoráveis e apenas uma se destacou para mim entre aliados e inimigos: Elamein. Apesar de o vilão ser bom, ele não sustenta a trama fraca. A história é definitivamente o ponto mais baixo do jogo, mas que não pesa tanto graças ao combate sólido e eficiente – pelo menos na maioria das vezes.\nO ponto de maior destaque e brilho de The First Berserker: Khazan é, sem dúvidas, o combate. Extremamente fluido, veloz, intenso, cheio de variedade de armas e habilidades. O game é um soulslike bastante voltado para o parry, mas não de uma forma semelhante a Sekiro. Aqui, a ausência de escudo obriga você a dominar a habilidade de aparar ataques e de desviar no momento certo, porém a esquiva é curta e muitas vezes é a pior opção para escapar de ataques.\nQuando partirmos para o ataque, no entanto, vemos aqui onde a equipe da Neople depositou grande parte dos esforços. Khazan é como uma mistura de Kratos, o Chosen One de Dark Souls e o Lobo de Sekiro — tudo isso parece confuso, mas quando o controlamos as coisas se alinham. O jogo apresenta três opções de arma: lanças, empunhadura dupla com espada e machado e, por fim, a espada de duas mãos. Na minha gameplay, optei pela lança na maior parte do tempo, afinal, o dano me pareceu mais equilibrado e a velocidade de ataque me satisfez mais.\nO crescimento da jogabilidade é exponencial: no começo temos combos simples e ataques com dardo — semelhante ao arco e flecha. No entanto, conforme aprofundamos a vasta árvore de habilidades de Khazan, as lutas se tornam mais fluidas, sangrentas e polidas de certa forma. Mesmo assim, não pude deixar de observar que em algumas situações a hitbox me pareceu meio confusa e até mesmo problemática, tanto para inimigos quanto para armadilhas do cenário, mas foram casos bem específicos e que não se repetiram.\nOs combos de lança são dinâmicos e se encaixaram perfeitamente na minha gameplay. Consegui acabar com inimigos rapidamente, mas precisamos falar sobre o equilíbrio de dificuldade muito peculiar que o jogo apresenta.\nQuanto às batalhas de chefe, algumas são básicas, desde a música e movimentos do inimigo até as arenas, enquanto outras mostram o potencial do jogo e exigem o uso máximo das mecânicas de The First Berserker. Na minha experiência pessoal, nenhuma delas merece grande destaque, exceto a batalha final que é digna de um grande RPG de ação pela magnitude do combate.\nUm grande destaque do jogo é a criação de builds que se baseia muito nos sistemas de Nioh. É possível ter muito controle dos status do personagem e adaptar Khazan para a sua arma e jogabilidade. Itens do mesmo set concedem bônus conforme você equipá-los e acumular status.\nO único sistema ruim de combate é o de invocações, que não ajudam em nada durante as batalhas de chefe e muitas vezes apenas atrapalham. No entanto, os fantasmas são um bom suporte em lutas rotineiras.\nObviamente, por ser um soulslike, The First Berserker: Khazan possui uma dificuldade acentuada, mas os picos de complexidade em progredir no jogo são… esquisitos. Alguns chefes e mapas iniciais são muito difíceis, enquanto algumas batalhas intermediárias contra inimigos de elite e até mesmo os chefões não apresentam desafio, e, por fim, as batalhas mais avançadas são surpreendentemente fáceis. Isso seria normal caso esses picos de dificuldade fossem parte da progressão que, obviamente, fica menos complexa conforme o avançar do jogo, mas The First Berserker tem uma inconsistência de dificuldade que, a meu ver, mostra uma falha de balanceamento no jogo que empobrece a experiência.\nUm dos maiores destaques da FromSoftware em Dark Souls é o mapa minuciosamente conectado que possui atalhos e conexões que exploram a sagacidade dos designers em produzir essas fases. Infelizmente, por optar em se inspirar na Team Ninja e jogos como Nioh e Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, o level design de The First Berserker: Khazan se perde em diversos momentos.\nApesar de contar com áreas vastas e alguns atalhos, muitas regiões do mapa parecem sem vida ou possuem conexões um tanto quanto sem sentido que seriam melhores apenas colocando outra espada da fenda, a “bonfire” do game, para tornar a ligação entre áreas dos biomas mais inteligentes. O jogo poderia olhar mais para Lies of P e criar um level design muito melhor, mas se inspirou justamente em soulslikes com design de mapa problemáticos.\nA má qualidade do level design se alinha à repetitividade de inimigos, aspecto ainda mais evidente quando olhamos para as missões secundárias, que reutilizam esses cenários com pequenas mudanças e tornam o jogo cansativo ao longo do tempo.\nThe First Berserker: Khazan é intenso para o bem e para o mal. Quando o jogo está imerso em seu combate, criação de builds e algumas batalhas de chefe, ele brilha e muito, quase alcançando a prateleira dos ótimos soulslikes. Contudo, o level design ruim, repetição de inimigos, história sonolenta e dificuldade inconsistente fazem ele cair de patamar e ser só mais um soulslike, embora ainda figure entre os bons títulos do gênero, não mais do que isso. Os amantes de Nioh e de jogatinas difíceis encontrarão muita diversão em mais de 35 horas de campanha."

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/avengers-doomsday-cast-reveal-the-internet-reacts-to-x-men-lots-of-chairs-missing-characters-and-more",
    "full_text": "Marvel dropped a surprise announcement today in the form of a nearly five-and-a-half-hour livestream that revealed the cast of Avengers: Doomsday. A new chair was added every 10-15 minutes with the name of an actor who will be part of this highly-anticipated film, and there were some big surprisesalongside the return of familiar faces.\n\nAs expected, the internet at large had some very entertaining and insightful reactions to the news, including the return of Channing Tatum's Gambit and other X-Men to this big movie that will see the MCU's Avengers take on Robert Downey Jr.'s Doctor Doom. We've gathered some of our favorites below and would love to hear your thoughts in the comment section as well\nAll in all, there were 27 chairs for 27 actorswho will be part of Avengers: Doomsday, and it all started with Chris Hemsworth (Thor). There weren't too many surprising reveals at the start as we learned Vanessa Kirby (Sue Storm), Anthony Mackie (Captain America), Sebastian Stan (Bucky), and Letitia Wright (Black Panther), would be part of the film. The first big moment, however, came when the chair of Paul Rudd (Ant-Man) was shown. Unlike the others, Rudd's chair was a bit smaller as a nod to his ability to shrink in size. As@JuanEditsnoted, \"the little chair announcing Paul Rudd is back as Ant-Man is genius ngl.\"\nthe little chair announcing paul rudd is back as ant man is genius nglpic.twitter.com/JYuc5h5sAu\nThe chairs continued to reveal that other actors like Wyatt Russell (U.S. Agent), Tenoch Huerta MejÍa (Namor), Ebon Moss-Bacharach (The Thing), Simu Liu (Shang-Chi), and Florence Pugh (Yelena Belova) will be part of Avengers: Doomsday, but this was also the point were some people started poking fun at how long this whole process was taking.\nThis was summed up quite nicely byHeavy Spoilers,who shared a clip from Saving Private Ryan of Matt Damon growing old very quickly.\nMe by the time the full Avengers Doomsday line-up gets announcedpic.twitter.com/AThBwqPPbk\nSimu Liualso took the time to celebrate this moment of Shang-Chi's return with a funny joke; \"*pokes head out of karaoke booth*\"\nThe next chair was another one the biggest surprise of the stream as it opened so many possibilities. Yes, it was confirmed that Kelsey Grammer would be returning as Beast after hispost-credits appearance in The Marvels.This was the long-awaited official confirmation that the X-Men will be part of Avengers: Doomsday. The fun didn't stop there either as it was also unveiled that Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Ian McKellen (Magneto), James Marsden (Cyclops), Rebecca Romijn (Mystique), and Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler) would be joining the roster as well.\nWhile there was a lot of excitement about these additions, it started to have MCU fans like@ResonantJusticequestion if this was the early signs ofAvengers: Doomsday secretly being an Avengers vs. X-Men moviewith Downey Jr.'s Doctor Doom pulling the strings.\nIs Avengers: Doomsday secretly an Avengers vs X-Men movie, just with RDJ as Doom pulling the strings in the background? 🤔 Looking more and more like it….pic.twitter.com/RqGb7LNjNg\nIGN writerCarlos Alonzo Moralesalso put forth a theory that Doctor Doom will kill \"most of the OG X-Men in this movie as his big 'what a bastard!' moment, freeing up budget for the more traditional MCU cast to be in the next one. He likely causes an Incursion of the Fox universe so we know what the stakes are for Secret Wars.\"\nWhile we may have to wait until May 1, 2026, to find out what secrets Avengers: Doomsday holds, there was one major surprise left for today's big reveal - Channing Tatum's Gambit will actually be returning after his appearance in Deadpool & Wolverine.\nI could share how special this moment was, but I thought I'd let this clip of@BrandonDavisBD, @FitDadCEO, and @KhleoThomasdo the heavy lifting.\nGambit got hands down the biggest pop of the entire 5.5 hour live stream. HE'S BACK@KhleoThomas@fitdadceopic.twitter.com/v0wNwGgjNR\nWe wrote about how2024 became the year of Gambit,but now it's looking like 2026 may be his biggest moment yet.\nThe stream ended with Robert Downey Jr. appearing on camera with his chair, and that was it! Well, RDJ did comment onMarvel Studios' Instagram postabout this big reveal, saying, \"That's what u call a deep bench of talent... actually it's more like a row, but an extra long one... that must be it... right?\" To which Marvel Studios responded, \"there's always room for more...\"\nThere were a lot of exciting reveals today, butthe characters not announced for Avengers: Doomsdaywere just as big a talking point. We may have already known thatElizabeth Olsen's Scarlet WitchandBenedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strangewould not be part of this first film, but some of the more shocking omissions were Spider-Man, Hulk, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, Rhodey, Wolverine, Storm, Jean Grey, Rogue, Deadpool, Valkyrie, Korg, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Young Avengers, Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, Spectrum, Binary, Wong, Agatha Harkness, Daredevil, Kate Bishop, Blade, and so many more.\nYes, we know Marvel has atonof characters and also wants to keep some character reveals a big secret, but this didn't stop the Internet from sharing their sadness about their favorite characters not getting a chair.\nThe Avengers: \"Doom is attacking!\"New Yorker #3: \"should we call Spider-Man?\"The Avengers:https://t.co/14ZwajnfUxpic.twitter.com/MSY6GzoXgz\nannouncing an avengers movie without their strongest most powerful avengers is crazypic.twitter.com/C3Wuc0t55r\n@bereliciiouzsummed up the feelings of a lot of Marvel fans with a NSFW clip from The Bear we just had to share.\n.@MarvelStudiosWHERE IS SPIDERMAN??? DAREDEVIL??? WOLVERINE??? MOON KNIGHT??? GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY??? WANDA AND STRANGE???pic.twitter.com/RwZ9LjgfIg\nThere were some fans, like@blurayangel,who had a cooler head and reminded everyone that Avengers: Doomsday is just the beginning and Avengers: Secret Wars is just behind the corner on May 7, 2027.\n\"If you thought the chair announcement of Avengers: Doomsday was insane... just wait for the cast of Avengers: Secret Wars,\" @blurayangel wrote. \"WESLEY SNIPES. HUGH JACKMAN. TOBEY MAGUIRE.\"\nWe love your wishful thinking! And you never know, dreams can come true!\nIt's also important to note that, as@demetherselfpoints out, only five of the 27 chairs revealed for today's Avengers: Doomsday cast reveal belonged to women. Here's hoping that divide shrinks in the final film.\n\"Out of 27 announced cast members for Avengers: Doomsday, only 5 are women,\" @demetherself wrote. \"That’s not just a small number, it’s a glaring reminder of how skewed things still are. How does this ratio even happen?\"\nTo end this reaction roundup, we had to share some of the funniest posts from people and brands who casted some of their favorite character from completely unrelated shows and films and much more.\nwait, what?pic.twitter.com/LClAB4S381\nSomehow Palpatine will return in AVENGERS: DOOMSDAYpic.twitter.com/BuSerc7948\nJennifer Coolidge will return as Tanya in ‘AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY’pic.twitter.com/s3Se7ASQCt\nAndy Serkis will return as Gollum in Avengers: Doomsdaypic.twitter.com/WskZoGR149\ni have a chair toopic.twitter.com/nyPk6jE1VA\nKnack will return as Knack in ‘AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY’pic.twitter.com/aVfGz639jO\nHugh Laurie will return as House in ‘AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY’pic.twitter.com/wVnChYC6TD\nThe cat from ‘FLOW’ will return in ‘AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY’pic.twitter.com/f2mFcbDeMN\nAnd for our last post, we are proud to present that one time we were just ever so close to getting James Marsden to reveal his role in Avengers: Doomsday.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/epic-death-stranding-2-trailer-reveals-release-date-new-gameplay-and-some-serious-metal-gear-vibes",
    "full_text": "Hideo Kojima took to the stage at SXSW 2025 in Austin, TX this evening to reveal an epic new trailer forDeath Stranding 2: On the Beach, as well as confirm a release date.\n\nDeath Stranding 2 launches on June 26, 2025 exclusively on PlayStation 5. However, those who buy the Digital Deluxe Edition or the Collector’s Edition get two days of early access from June 24.\nThe 10-minute long video, below, includes various cinematics, gameplay clips, and, perhaps most notably, a close look at a character who many are already saying looks a lot like Snake from Kojima's world famous Metal Gear franchise.\nThe character, Neil, played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli, is seen putting on a bandanna, as Snake does, before leading a team of creepy looking soldiers. The similarity to Solid Snake is remarkable.\nPerhaps Marinelli's Snake-like role in Death Stranding 2 shouldn't come as much of a surprise. In a 2020Instagram post, Kojima heaped praise on the actor, saying that if he wore a bandanna he'd be a \"spitting image\" of Solid Snake.\n\"There are many actors that I follow,\" Kojima said at the time. \"Luca Marinelli recently caught my eye after watching The Old Guard and Martin Eden. He played an impressive villain in They Call Me Jeeg Robot, but I think that he will break out soon, and his popularity will increase. Also, I think if he donned a bandanna, he’d be a spitting image of Solid Snake!\"\nThe trailer continues the Metal Gear vibes with the Magellan Man, a huge tar-like creature fused with the DHV Magellan that looks a bit like Metal Gear Rex (a 15\" statue of the Magellan Man is included in the Collector's Edition). The Magellan Man appears to be operated like a Pacific Rim-style mech, and faces off against enormous and very creepy tar monsters.\nThe standard edition of Death Stranding 2 costs $69.99, as expected. The Collector's Edition, meanwhile, costs $229.99. The Digital Deluxe Edition costs $79.99. Pre-orders begin on March 17.\nContinuing the story ofDeath Stranding, which has had over 19 million players worldwide since its release on November 8, 2019, Death Stranding 2 carries the tagline, 'Should We Have connected?' Here's the official blurb:\nMeanwhile, Kojima announced the Death Stranding global concert tour, dubbed The Strands of Harmony World Tour. Set for 19 cities across the globe, the concerts will feature an orchestra and singers performing selections from Ludvig Forssell's critically acclaimed scores alongside music from other artists featured in the games. Synchronised HD video projections will accompany the performances, showing moments from both Death Stranding and its sequel. The premiere is on November 8, 2025, the sixth anniversary of Death Stranding's release, at the Sydney Opera House.\nIt's a hugely busy time for Kojima and his studio, Kojima Productions. As well as Death Stranding 2, Kojima is working on a live-actionDeath Stranding filmwith A24, the studio behind Academy Award winning films such as Everything Everywhere All At Once. He's also working onODfor Xbox Game Studios, and video game and movie hybridPhysintfor Sony.\nThere are no release dates for OD or Physint. Indeed, in January,Kojima revealed the ongoing video game actors strike had affected production on both titles, so it may be some time before we hear or see more.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "title": "Could The Witcher 4 Be Targeting the PS6 and Next-Gen Xbox, Given It Won't Be Out Until 2027 at the Earliest?",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-26T08:45:58Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/could-the-witcher-4-be-targeting-the-ps6-and-next-gen-xbox-given-it-wont-be-out-until-2027-at-the-earliest",
    "full_text": "Don’t hold your breath forThe Witcher 4. According to the developers at CD Projekt, it won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest.\n\nSpeaking in afinancial calloutlining projections of future profits, CD Projekt said: “Even though we do not plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026, we are still driven by this financial goal. And although it’s very ambitious, we stand a chance of achieving it within the given timeframe.”\nThat rules out a launch this year, which no-one really expected, a launch next year, which some had hoped for, and sets 2027 as the earliest The Witcher 4 will come out. But that’s if everything goes to plan, and as we all know, the video game industry has a hard time with its plans. Could The Witcher 4 end up being a 2028 game? It sounds possible.\nEither way, 2027 at the earliest suggests The Witcher 4 may well end up targeting the next-generation of consoles, with Sony no-doubt working on its PlayStation 6 plans as we speak, andMicrosoft rumored to be targeting a 2027 release for its Xbox Series X successor and an Xbox handheld. But is it a cross-gen game, as Cyberpunk 2077 was when it released in December 2020?\nIf it is a cross-gen game, with a version for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, could The Witcher 4 end up working on Nintendo Switch 2? It seems unlikely at face value, but The Witcher 3 ended up on the Switch, so miracles do happen.\nHere's what we know: The Witcher 4 is the first in a new trilogy of Witcher games set after the events of The Witcher 3. But rather than star Geralt as protagonist, Ciri is the main character this time around.\nSpeaking exclusively to IGN ahead of The Witcher 4 reveal, executive producer Małgorzata Mitręga said Ciri was “the very organic, logical choice.”\n“It was always about her, starting from Saga when you read it in the books. She's an amazing, layered character. And of course, as a protagonist we said goodbye to Geralt previously. So this is a continuation. I guess for all of us it’s like she was meant to be. That was always her.”\nIn January, speaking to IGN as part of a wider interview on Netflix’s upcoming animated film,The Witcher: Sirens of The Deep,Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle backed CD Projekt’s decision, even though it sees Geralt take a back seat.\n“I'm really excited,” he said. “I think it's a really good move. I mean, I always thought that continuing the Saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons, but mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because people, I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done.”\nAnd in February,the director ofThe Witcher 4clarified that a new video featured the same in-game model of Ciri after some had thought her face looked different.\nWe’ve got plenty more exclusive content on The Witcher 4, includinga trailer breakdownand an interview with CD Projekt where the developer explainswhy The Witcher 4 will avoid a Cyberpunk 2077-style launch disaster.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-live-action-movie-has-its-director",
    "full_text": "Michael Sarnoski, director of A Quiet Place: Day One, is reportedly set to write and direct the live-action adaptation of Kojima Productions' Death Stranding.\n\nPerDeadline, Sarnoski will write and direct the Death Stranding adaptation with A24 and Kojima Productions producing, alongside Square Peg. Sarnoski directed and wrote for both theA Quiet Place spin-off Day Oneand2021's Pig, starring Nicolas Cage. He's also the writer/director for the upcomingThe Death of Robin Hood, another A24 project.\nFew details were given about what the live-action adaptation of Death Stranding would entail. The original 2019 game sent players out into the wasteland to try and reconnect a scattered America amid an extinction-level event, in a world haunted by nightmarish creatures and strange happenings. It's already good movie fodder before you factor in Hideo Kojima's cinematic tendencies.\nDeath Stranding also featured a star-studded cast that included Norman Reedus in the lead role of Sam Bridges, as well as Léa Seydoux, Mads Mikkelsen, Guillermo del Toro, and Margaret Qualley. It'll be interesting to see if these actors reprise their roles for the live-action adaptation.\nThere's still more for Death Stranding in store though, asKojima Productions recently confirmed Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will launchlater this year on June 26, 2025 on PlayStation 5. The next game in the Death Stranding saga also picked up some more stars, including the likes of Luca Marinelli and Elle Fanning.\nHopefully this particular Kojima-linked project forges ahead, as theMetal Gear Solid movie is still reportedly being worked ondespite slowing updates. With all the stars and cinematics though, Death Stranding certainly seems poised to make the jump to live-action.\nEric is a freelance writer for IGN."

    "full_text": "Finding a good deal on Apple products is rough, which is why I focused on all of these daily deals today. Finding multiple Apple deals, plus discounts on Zelda and Final Fantasy collectibles? It's my gamer-tech jackpot. Right now, you can save onAirPods Pro 2, grab aMagSafe leather case for just $11.99, and even score afour-pack of AirTags for under $70.\n\nIf you’re in the market forwireless earbuds,power adapters, or anApple Watchband, there are plenty of options at all-time low prices. And you know by now I like to pop in some really cool gaming stuff. How about a full-sizedMaster Sword replicathat plays Zelda music when you swing it and aFinal Fantasy I-VI bundlethat brings the pixel-perfect RPG classics back to life?\nUpgrade your tech, complete your Zelda shrine, or relive Final Fantasy’s golden era, these deals are worth checking out. Some discounts like the iPhone 14 Plus MagSafe case, are downright ridiculous at 80% off. But Apple deals never last long (Tim Cook loves that Apple tax), and limited collectibles definitely sell out fast. If something catches your eye, now’s the time to add to cart before the price jumps back up.\nAliExpress is offering this Arzopa 15\" 1080p USB Type-C portable monitor for only $57 shipped after you apply coupon code \"IFPQHLH\". We've posted deals on this portable monitor in the past, but this is the lowest price we've seen thus far. The marketplace vendor is Arzopa itself so you're getting the full manufacturer's warranty on this brand new, retail packaged item. This monitor is primarily designed to be a secondary display for a laptop, but the S1's 1080p 60Hz panel is a great match for the Nintendo Switch's hardware, since the Switch only supports up to 720p @ 60Hz anyway.\nFor only $22 more, you can upgrade to the higher end Arzopa Z1FC USB portable monitor, now only $79.19 after coupon code \"IFPQHLH\". It's currently $117 on Amazon. The Z1FC's upgrades include a larger display (16.1\" vs 15.6\"), a higher refresh rate (144Hz vs. 60Hz), and better color reproduction (100% sRGB color gamut). This is a better monitor than the S1 to pair with the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally because both gaming handhelds can support refresh rates up to 144Hz.\nApple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.\nBeats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art. The remastered soundtracks, modernized UI, and quality-of-life improvements bring these classics into the modern age while keeping their original charm intact.

At 41.3 inches, it’s a full-sized, collector-worthy version of Link’s legendary blade. It’s not just for display either thanks to authentic sound effects and vibrations activate when you grip and swing it, making you feel like the true Hero of Hyrule.\nThe hilt features three buttons that play eight iconic songs from Zelda’s history, including themes from Ocarina of Time, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom. The sword comes with a sheath and display stand, so whether you want to show it off or take it into battle (against your furniture), it’s ready. At $200, this highly allocated collectible is bound to sell out fast.\nA genuine Apple leather case for $11.99? That’s not a typo. It’s an 80% discount. Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.\nIf you’re tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.\nWhy buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible.

It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.\nStill using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.\nThese aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.\nThese Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.\nLuxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.\nThis isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.\nFor those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says \"powerful Pokémon\" like an angry robot penguin).\nI'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.\nIf somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.\nYour PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).\nIf you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, \"I really need to delete some games,\" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-sony-and-more-japanese-game-companies-suffer-stock-market-plunge-as-trumps-tariffs-hit-hard",
    "full_text": "Video game companies across Japan have suffered a dramatic stock market plunge sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nWhite House officials signalled what they describe as specific reciprocal tariffs on roughly 60 of the \"worst offenders\" to go into effect on 9 April. Japan is one of the countries subject to these customised tariff rates, at 24%.\nTrump's officials say these countries charge higher tariffs on U.S. goods, impose \"non-tariff\" barriers to U.S. trade, or have otherwise acted in ways they feel undermine American economic goals.\nTariffs are essentially taxes placed on the cost of importing certain goods. While it's possible for companies in the supply chain to simply eat these costs, more often than not these taxes are passed onto consumers. And unfortunately for gamers, rising prices are very likely to impact tech and gaming goods.\nJapan's Nikkei 225 benchmark index closed down 7.8%, the ASX 200 in Australia lost 4.2%, and the Kospi in South Korea ended 5.6% lower. The Shanghai Composite closed 7.3% lower and Taiwan Weighted Index lost 9.7%. The Hang Seng was down by 12.5% in afternoon trading.\nDr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, rounded up the decline in video game stocks based in Japan as the market opening in the morning of April 7. Nintendo was down 7.35%, Sony 10.16%, Capcom 7.13%, and Sega 6.57%.\nIt's Monday 10am in Japan where Japanese game stocks currently react to these insultingly dumb tariffs like so:Nintendo -7.35%Sony -10.16%Bandai Namco -7.03%Konami -3.93%Sega -6.57%Koei Tecmo -5.83%Capcom -7.13%Square Enix -5.23%The mobile game companies do even worse.\nLast week Nintendo shocked the video game world by announcinga delay to pre-orders of the Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S., blaming tariffs and the uncertainty they have caused across the world. The pre-orders were set to go live on April 9, but in the U.S. specifically they were postponed, with the June 5 release date said to be on-track. Pre-orders go live elsewhere on April 9 as planned.\nNintendo announced the Switch 2 at $449.99, with a Mario Kart World bundle priced $499.99.Mario Kart World itself is priced $79.99.\nNiko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad had warnedthat Trump's surprise tariffs on countries such as Vietnam, where Nintendo had shifted some of its Switch 2 manufacturing in anticipation of U.S. tariffs on China, might have caused a rethink.\n\"While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset U.S. tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world,\" Ahmad said. \"The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect.\"\nNintendo fansandanalystsare now concerned Nintendo will raise the price of the Switch 2 and its games even further, even asit suffers a backlash to its pricing following the console’s reveal.\nThere are question marks over Sony, too, which manufactures PlayStation consoles, including the $700 PlayStation 5 Pro. IGN has asked the company if it has any comment on the prospect of increased prices in the U.S.\nGoldman Sachs now forecasts there is a 45% chance the U.S. will fall into recession in the next 12 months, up from a previous estimate of 35%. JPMorgan now sees a 60% chance of a U.S. and global economic downturn.\nAccording to a report by theBBC, Trump has defended the tariffs, saying \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"\nFor more, check outeverything announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct, andwhat the experts have to say about the Switch 2 price and Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag.\nPhoto by DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty Images.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "full_text": "Rockstar’s new and improved version ofGrand Theft Auto 5isn’t going down well on Steam following its launch earlier in March.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 5 Enhanced, which released on March 4, has a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, with 54% of the 19,772 user reviews flagged as positive.\nTo put that into context, the original GTA 5 on Steam, now unlisted at the request of Rockstar Games and as a result unable to appear in search on Valve's platform, has a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam.\nIn fact, GTA 5 Enhanced is currently the worst user-reviewed GTA on Steam, with its closest competitor for the unwanted crown,Grand Theft Auto III – The Definitive Edition, on 66% positive reviews.\nGTA 5 Enhanced is a free upgrade for GTA 5 on PC that includes sought-after features previously only available in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S versions ofGTA Online— including all the latest vehicles and performance upgrades available at Hao’s Special Works, animal encounters, and access to purchase a GTA+ Membership — along with improved graphics options and faster loading times. All players who currently own GTA 5 on PC can upgrade to this new version for free, with the ability to migrate your Story Mode and Online progress.\nYou’d think that would be a relatively straightforward process, but it appears the account migration isn’t working as intended for many players. Indeed, account migration problems are at the heart of most of the negative reviews flagged as ‘most helpful.’\n“ ‘The GTA Online profile associated with this Rockstar Games account is not eligible for migration at this time,’ ” reported one disgruntled player. “If you think I'm throwing away nearly 700 hours of gameplay on one character so that you can make a few more bucks off me, then you can lick my anal orifice clean.\n“This is an objective downgrade from the ‘old’ version. Gonna pretend this was never released and continue to enjoy Legacy version until the new game comes out when I'm 60.”\n“I'm leaving a negative review mainly due to Rockstar deciding that some accounts should arbitrarily not be able to migrate, and if you ask for help from support, they just say they can't do anything about it,” reads another.\n\"I can't migrate either of my two accounts,\" another negative review reads. \"R* support is completely useless and can't help. With the game being over 10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years old I am sure as hell not going to completely restart all my progress in Online just to get marginally better graphics (if that) and HSW and whatever other minuscule ♥♥♥♥ they added.\"\nDespite these issues, GTA 5 Enhanced remains one of the most-played games on Steam, with a 187,059 peak concurrent player count since launch. But it has sparked concern over the inevitable PC release ofGrand Theft Auto 6, with some PC gamers worrying that Rockstar's struggles with GTA 5 Enhanced could signal launch trouble down the line.\nGTA 6 is planned for launch during the fall of 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only, leaving PC gamers out in the cold. In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstarattempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hitsconsole, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.\nWe’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including Take-Two boss StraussZelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out. Meanwhile,Take-Two has sued online marketplace PlayerAuctions, alleging it contains \"thousands of listings for unauthorized, infringing GTA 5 content – including heavily modified player accounts, in-game assets, and virtual currency – all gained by using hacking software, cheats, and technical exploits.\"\nAnd in other news,Rockstar recently acquiredGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Editiondeveloper Video Games Deluxeand renamed it Rockstar Australia.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "full_text": "Withthe wait for The Witcher 4 set to head into 2027, it’s a similar story for Naughty Dog’s recently announcedIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.\n\nBloomberg reporter Jason Schreier took toResetErato say neither The Witcher 4 nor Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will be out next year.\nThat means like The Witcher 4, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will be released in 2027 at the earliest. And, like The Witcher 4, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will face questions around whether or not it’s targeting the PlayStation 5 or the inevitable PlayStation 6, or, perhaps most likely, is a cross-gen game.\nIf Intergalactic heads straight to PS6, Naughty Dog faces the prospect of having skipped the PS5 generation in terms of brand new games. So far, the studio has released ports, remasters, and remakes on Sony’s current-gen console, including The Last of Us Part II, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, The Last of Us Part I, and The Last of Us Part II Remastered.\nNaughty Dog revealed Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet at The Game Awards 2024. It features a star-studded cast that includes Tati Gabrielle from the Uncharted movie as protagonist Jordan A. Mun, and Kumail Nanjiani of Marvel's Eternals as a man called Colin Graves.\nBut fans have analysed the trailer, below,to piece together the rest of the cast, and though it focuses on just a couple of characters, a photo of what appears to be a crew revealed even more.\nEarlier this month, The Last of Us director Neil Druckmannshared more details aboutIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.\nIn aninterviewwith Alex Garland, the writer of zombie movie 28 Days Later, Druckmann talked candidly about the development process, confirming Intergalactic had been in the works for four years already.\n\"I joke about this with the team. We made a game,The Last of Us 2, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game,\" Druckmann said, to which Garland joked: \"Who gives a shit?\"\n\"Exactly,\" Druckmann added. \"But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about — let's make a game about faith and religion.\"\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet takes place in an alternate historical timeline and features a \"pretty prominent religion,\" too, which has \"changed and bastardized and evolved\" over the years.\n\"This whole religion takes place on this one planet, and then at one point, all communication stops,\" Druckmann teased. \"And you're playing a bounty hunter that's chasing her bounty, and she crash lands on this planet.\n\"So many of the previous games we've done, there's always, like, an ally with you,\" he said. \"I really want you to be lost in a place that you're really confused about what happened here, who are the people here, what was their history. And in order to get off this planet — again, no one has been heard from this planet for 600 years or so — if you ever have hoped to have a chance to get off, you have to figure out what happened here.\"\nAssuming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet releases in 2027, and taking into account Druckmann’s comment about it being in development for four years so far, by the time the game comes out it will have been in the works for six years.\nIt’s a pretty long wait, but speaking to IGN on the red carpet ahead of The Last of Us Season 2 premiere, Druckmann said that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is not only playable right now, but “really good.”\n“I will say we are playing it at the office and it's incredible,” Druckmann teased. “It's really good. I'm so excited to finally put gameplay out into the world and show people about it, because we just showed you the very, very, very tip on the iceberg. The game goes pretty deep beyond that.”\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100. You can reach Wesley at wesley_yinpoole@ign.com or confidentially at wyp100@proton.me."

    "full_text": "Death Stranding 2: On the Beachgot a new trailer over the weekend, alongside a release date, collector's edition, box art, and more. And as fans have pored over the details, one has noticed a fun connection to director Hideo Kojima's past work: Metal Gear Solid 2.\n\nThe box art for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach shows Sam \"Porter\" Bridges, portrayed by Norman Reedus, holding the child \"Lou,\" who players of the first game will recognize.Reddit user ReverseTheFlashposted \"He did it again,\" showing that box art alongside a Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty slipcase with a similar motif.\nThe Metal Gear Solid 2 promo shows Japanese singer Gackt holding a child in a similar composition. Though it's not a one-for-one, it's certainly fun to note the similarities between the two covers. It's also a reminder of a strange branch of Metal Gear Solid (out-of-universe) backstory.\nDuring the run-up to the game's release, Gackt was featured inmultiplepromosfor Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. Part of this, it seems, included special slip-covers for the game in some territories, which have resulted in random MGS ephemera that'sboth intrigued and confused people over the years.\nIn case you're wondering why Gackt, specifically, was so involved with Metal Gear Solid 2's promotional campaign,Kojima offered an explanation in 2013. The reason he asked Gackt to \"be on MGS2's TVCM is 'MGS1' was about DNA & 'MGS2' MEME. DNA consists 'AGTC', adding 'K' of KOJIMA becomes 'GACKT.' \" So, there's that.\nConsidering Death Stranding 2's new trailer hasplenty of Metal Gear vibes in it, it's no surprise fans are drawing the parallels here. Personally, I think any similarities are, at most, a sign of recurring ideas across Kojima's games. But still, it's fun to speculate and ponder, and it's always a good time to travel down memory lane with a promotional cover featuring Gackt.\nDeath Stranding 2: On the Beach launches on June 26, 2025 exclusively on PlayStation 5.\nEric is a freelance writer for IGN."

Rebellion is the developer behind the popular Sniper Elite series of games, as well as the spin-off Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army entries.\nHere's the official blurb:\n“We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall,” said Jason Kingsley CBE, CEO and co-founder of Rebellion.\n“To have surpassed the 1 million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off.\n“We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series.\n“We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game.”\nWhile Atomfall launched simultaneously across PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series X and S and Xbox One,it also released on Game Pass as a day-one title, which will have significantly boosted player numbers.\nRebellion did not say how many copies of the game were sold, however, preferring, like Assassin’s Creed Shadows maker Ubisoft, to go down the player number route. But it did provide some fun stats to back up it announcement.\nOver 316,000 Atomfall players, for example, have killed the scientist at the very beginning of the game. In total there have been over 3.7 million kills using the cricket bat, while over 4 million pasties and 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed.\nIGN'sAtomfall reviewreturned an 8/10.

    "publishedAt": "2025-03-17T09:08:48Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-actor-ashly-burch-says-sonys-ai-aloy-video-left-her-feeling-worried-about-game-performance-as-an-art-form",
    "full_text": "Horizon actor Ashly Burch has addressed the AI Aloy video that leaked online last week, using it to call attention to the demands of striking voice actors.\n\nLast week,The Vergereported on the emergence ofan internal Sony video showing off tech that uses Aloy from the Horizon series to demonstrate AI-powered characters. Sony has yet to respond to IGN’s request for comment.\nIn the now deleted video, Sony Interactive Entertainment director of software engineering, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, has a conversation with an AI-powered Aloy via voice prompts and AI-generated speech and facial animations. Raghoebardajal asks Aloy how she's doing, to which she responds: \"Hello, I'm managing alright. Just dealing with a sore throat. How have you been?\"\nThe voice heard coming from Aloy's mouth is clearly not that of Burch, rather a robotic voice similar to those heard from text-to-speech voice generators. AI Aloy's facial movements are stiff and her eyes appear lifeless as she converses with Raghoebardajal.\nBurch, who has voiced Aloy in all four Horizon video games released so far (Zero Dawn, Forbidden West, Call of the Mountain, and Lego Horizon Adventures) took to social media platform TikTok to confirm that she had seen the video, and that Horizon developer Guerrilla had got in touch to let her know that the tech demo did not reflect anything that was in active development, nor did it use any of Burch’s performance (facial or voice data). That presumably rules out AI Aloy forthe upcoming Horizon multiplayer game, assuming the character is in the game, and the inevitable Horizon 3. However, as Burch pointed out, Guerrilla (and parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment) owns Aloy as a character.\nWith all this in mind, Burch said the AI Aloy video left her feeling “worried about game performance as an art form,” and used it as a jumping off point to discuss the ongoing video game voice actors strike that has claimed a number of high-profile casualties in recent weeks.\nLast week, the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) issued an update to its members on the status of negotiations over video game actor AI protections, saying that while progress had been made, it was still \"frustratingly far apart\" with the industry bargaining group on key issues.\n“Currently what we’re fighting for is, you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form, you have to compensate us fairly, and you have to tell us how you’re using this AI double,” Burch said.\n“I feel worried not because the technology exists. Not even because game companies want to use it. Of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements. I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it, that does have someone’s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections, any way to fight back. And that possibility, it makes me so sad it hurts my heart. It scares me. I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances. I want to be able to continue to do this job. If we don’t win, that future is really compromised.\n“I’m genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on blast,” Burch continued. “Certainly not Guerrilla. The technology isn’t the problem. Game companies wanting to use the technology isn’t the problem. The problem is we’re currently on strike and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections.\n“I support the strike. I’ve always supported the strike. I believe fighting is what we have to do to protect the future and the longevity of this career that we all love so much.”\nBurch then pointed to the temporary union contracts that currently give all the protections the striking voice actors are asking for, that any video game company can sign right now. “There’s the interim, the tiered, and low budget agreement contracts available right now for any game company to sign,” Burch said. “I believe we deserve to be protected.”\nlet us speak on AI aloy\nGenerative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI.The game failed, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”\nStill, that hasn’t put off a number of video game companies from using generative AI in the development of their products.Activision recently disclosed the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assetsas part of new requirements on Steam, amid a backlash to an \"AI slop\" zombie Santa loading screen.\nAnd the voice actor strike has begun to impact a number of video games. Players have reported that games such as Destiny 2 and World of Warcraft appear to have certain NPCs left unvoiced in otherwise voiced scenes, likely due to the strike. Late last year, SAG-AFTRA struck League of Legends after Riotallegedly tried to subvert the strike by canceling a game in response. And Activision confirmedCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 characters were recastafter players expressed concern about new voices.\nJust last week,two Zenless Zone Zero voice actors revealedthey learned they'd been replaced when they saw the game's latest patch notes.\nHead of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash recentlyweighed in on AI to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamerswho seek \"personalization across everything.\"\n\"For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning.\"\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

So, the video game world is watching Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ early performance closely for signs of its success — or failure.\nThere’s also a lot of attention on Shadows’ Steam concurrents, which are being compared to those of other triple-A single-player games that recently released, as well as previous Assassin’s Creed games on Valve’s platform.\nShadows became the most-played Assassin's Creed game ever on Steam over the weekend with 64,825 peak concurrent players, although it’s worth noting that it was the first game in the series to launch day-one there since 2018's Odyssey. BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardsaw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.\nIt’s hard to make a call on whether Shadows is below, meeting, or exceeding Ubisoft’s expectations without knowing what those expectations were, a revenue figure, or a sales figure.\nMoney talks, of course, and irrespective of player numbers and engagement, it will be revenue brought in by Assassin’s Creed Shadows that determines the fate of not just the game, but Ubisoft itself. We may not get a clear picture of that until Ubisoft's next financial report in the coming months.\nAdventuring across feudal Japan?

    "full_text": "Gaming fans are feeling the heat after Nintendo announced itsSwitch 2 U.S. pre-order date was delayedas a direct result of the newly announced tariffs posed by the Trump Administration.\n\nWednesday morning, Nintendo fully unveiled its hybrid console sequel alongside plans to open pre-orders come April 9 — news thatDonald Trump would soon implement sweeping tariffs across the globearrived just hours later. It was a moment of whiplash that the industry is still struggling to come to grips with, and now, two days later, the average gaming fan is already feeling the impact.\n“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,” Nintendo said in a statement shared with IGN. “Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”\nI really hate being right. I kept telling folks that things can literally change tomorrow. People kept yelling at me that the tariffs won't affect us...aight man 😒\n46% tariff on Vietnamese imports announced now.Nintendo Switch 2 are produced there…It’s so fucking over.pic.twitter.com/5N1iAMI2Jm\nthey’re gonna make it even more expensivepic.twitter.com/5Y8FL9FZF6\n“Wait a minute… are you sayingwehave to pay the tariffs??” oneReddit user commented. “Who could have possibly foreseen this?!”\nWhile pre-order timing for other territories, including the UK, remains unchanged, Nintendo didn’t mince words when it came to how tariffs will affect those in the United States. However, changes to a release schedule, even when it comes to something as simple as pre-order timing, signal that Nintendo has more on its mind than it has revealed thus far.\nThere were fears that Nintendo’s proposed $450 Switch 2 price and$80 gamesmight be too big of an ask pre-tariffs — amovement aiming to get Nintendo to lower its price plansalready began shortly after that initial reveal — but the struggle for affordable games is just getting started. While someanalysts had suggestedSwitch 2 prices were calculated with potential tariffs in mind, Nintendo’s announcement today suggests those numbers have room to increase.\nSo thenThose WERE the pre tariff pricesYeah the Switch and Mario Kart bout to be 650 after taxes\nAmericans checking the updated Switch 2 prices after complaining about the old oneshttps://t.co/fsC60LU5YEpic.twitter.com/t4RwqXia8J\nNintendo hasn’t announced when or if its Switch 2 prices will change, but there is plenty of reason to worry they will shift in a more expensive direction. What began as a wave of frustration aimed at the current Switch 2 price has now evolved into an ocean of people who, of course, are still angry, but now they are just hoping they’ll be able to afford the new console.\n“This unironically frustrates me so much,” anotherReddit user added. “The switch 2 was already going to be quite expensive (compared to the OG) but I was still okay with paying the extra money for it. The games were another blow. Was too expensive already but whatever. But this? Huge tariffsPlus Sales taxPlus tariffs on the games???\n“I don’t want to pay 130$ for a damn copy of a game or 600$ for the new Switch. I genuinely (think) this will impact the amount of people able to buy into all of this. I shouldn’t as an average person be priced out of this, yet I probably will be. Augh…”\nI feel bad for all my US followers. If you thought the Switch 2 price was expensive before. It looks like its going to get even worse due to new tariffs.\nWe'vespoken to other industry analystswho acknowledge that these unprecedented tariffs have gamers and game-makers walking into uncharted territory and that there's no telling what exactly will happen with the Switch 2. While some believe we could soon see a price increase, others aren't so sure, but all agree that the industry will no doubt feel the impact of the Trump Administration's wide-reaching tariff plans.\nThe Switch 2 is Nintendo’s latest groundbreaking console, but a suddenly increased price could be just the start of what’s to come. Wespoke with Entertainment Software Association (ESA) spokesperson Aubrey Quinn to learn more about how Trump’s unprecedented tariffs will impact video game fans moving forward. As many have already feared, the ESA says there’s no reason to believe the damage will stop at Nintendo.\nIt does not stop at Nintendo Switch 2 btw.-PC parts like CPU's and GPU's are gonna go up-Laptops going up-Anything Tech related is going up.Next PlayStation and Xbox gonna require a blood sacrifice.\nThe prices of your consoles, tech, and pretty much every daily necessity are about to go up.There's a good chance Nintendo is about to announce a price hike for the Switch 2. Do not be surprised if Sony and Microsoft follow suit.PC market is already screwed.https://t.co/M40UFMyRH5\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is priced at $449.99 at the time of this piece’s publication.

    "full_text": "Path of Exile 2developer Grinding Gear Games has fully detailed the first major content update since the action RPG’s early access launch last year.\n\nDawn of the Hunt goes live at 9pm CET on April 4, and adds the new Huntress class. The Huntress is a Spear and Buckler user specialising in hybrid melee and ranged combat. Elsewhere, there are five new ascension classes: the Ritualist, Amazon, Smith of Kitava, Tactician, and Lich.\nPlayers can also expect dozens of new encounters in the endgame, significant mechanical overhauls, over one hundred new unique items as well as significantly expanded crafting options.\nThe long wait for the Path of Exile 2 early access launch finally came to an end when it released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on December 6, 2024. It saw massive success,securing its place as the 15th most-played game Steam game ever.\nBut the game ran into issues, both technical and in design. GGG has worked to update the game in the months since, culminating in next month's Dawn of the Hunt release.\nAt the same time, GGG continues to operate the first Path of Exile game, which still enjoys a healthy playerbase on Steam, as a live service. But this has proved challenging. In January,GGG was forced to apologize to fans of the first gameafter putting a new update on hold until a crucial update for Path of Exile 2 was released.\nMeanwhile,Path of Exile 2 has found itself embroiled in an online disputethat revolves around X / Twitter owner Elon Musk’s admission that he paid someone to boost his account. When contacted by IGN, Grinding Gear Games declined to comment.\nObliterate your enemies with the hybrid ranged and melee Huntress\nStep into the bloodstained boots of the Huntress, a dexterous and ferocious spear-wielding warrior. Banished from her homeland, she now stalks her prey using both ranged spear throws and close combat attacks. Her brutal arsenal is designed to make combat feel like a relentless pursuit, always in motion, moving into and out of melee range at a moments notice.\nThe Huntress can also Parry incoming attacks from monsters, stunning them before following up with one of several counterattacks. For example, use Disengage after a Parry to quickly jump back, gaining a Frenzy charge, then follow up with an empowered spear throw.\nStalk your prey with an array of elemental spear attacks that empower the Huntress to use some of the longest combo chains we have created on any class.\nCreate mayhem with five new ascendancy classesWith five new Ascendancy Classes, Dawn of the Hunt introduces fresh new ways to expand your build options.\nSharpen your arsenal with new skill and support gemsAs well as20 New Spear Skillsdesigned for the huntress, we have two other much anticipated abilities.\nThis expansion also brings a massive overhaul to character development by addingover 100 new Support Gemsto enhance build diversity. Support gems add a variety of interesting effects to your existing skills, modifying them in game changing ways.\nFor example, Haemocrystals turn bleed effects into explosive Vaal crystals, and Caltrops allow your existing skills to litter the battlefield with slowing hazards.\nUnlock greater potential with Over 100 new Unique ItemsDawn of the Hunt brings a stronger focus on Mid and Endgame Unique items, ensuring high-level characters have more thrilling bounty to chase.\nUnbridled power awaits with new crafting toolsNew crafting tools have been introduced as rewards across many areas of the game:\nDarkness lurks aheadThe Azmeri Spirit has made itself present in Wraeclast. When approached, these wisps will flee, and monsters it comes into contact with will be infused by it, making them more powerful. Wisps will also find and possess Rare or Unique monsters, granting them powerful new abilities, and powerful new rewards. There are twelve distinct types of wisp, each with their own mechanics and rewards.\nNew MapsDawn of the Hunt adds eight new Maps offering fresh challenges and rewards. Each of them come with interesting new encounters.\nBe forced to fight mirrored Rare monsters in a shifting, warped reality inThe Fractured Lake, or be thrust into the wild Ezomyte Forests ofThe Phaaryl Megalithswhere rune-carved stones surge with energy.  Survive the storm-fueled gauntlet of deadly boss waves, and you’ll earn full boss rewards and exclusive Runes\nUnique Strongboxes\nFind four new Unique Strongboxes, each with deadly mechanics and valuable rewards.\nCorrupted Essences\nEssences receive major upgrades, with four new Corrupted Essences -Hysteria, Delirium, Horror, and Insanity- offering new combat mechanics and powerful new crafting outcomes, such as guaranteed double Enchantments when using a Vaal Orb on belts.\nCleanse the CorruptionCorruption has continued to spread throughout Wraeclast and has formed into larger and larger zones. In the centre of each one lies a Corrupted Nexus, the home of three new terrifying bosses, amalgamations of Corruption itself.\nUpon defeating these bosses, any remaining areas within the zone of Corruption will become cleansed. Cleansed Maps have additional new monsters, a new boss and their own set of Modifiers and rewards.\nDuel with Rogue ExilesOn your travels you will sometimes encounter Rogue Exiles - others like you who have been exiled and are openly hostile. They will challenge you - a fight to the death. These Exiles have capabilities to Dodge Roll, avoid your abilities with smart pathfinding, smart-targeting, and much more action-packed gameplay. Rogue Exiles use the same skills available to players, and even the same items. They aren't just dressed up in those items, they know how to take advantage of the Uniques they are using.\nOf course, if you are able to slay these Exiles, those items will all drop on the ground!\nDynamic improvements to endgameDawn of the Hunt significantly rebalances the endgame. The number of towers has been drastically reduced but they have been made much more powerful. Tablets now affect twice as many areas and running higher tier Maps in Towers increases this number further still. In addition, each Tower will be able to consume up to three Tablets at once.\nThese changes significantly reduce the amount of busy work required in endgame while improving your ability to use them. On top of that, Towers can now spawn with all mechanics, and have their own new Bosses!\nPrepare for the HuntRise as a hunter, or fall as prey on April 4th. The Dawn of the Hunt content update will also be made available in existing Early Access leagues for those wishing to play their existing characters. It is recommended to start anew in a fresh economy to get the full, recommended experience in the Dawn of the Hunt leagues.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
