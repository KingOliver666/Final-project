    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-logo-pops-up-on-work-in-progress-starfield-creation-sparking-ps5-release-speculation",
    "full_text": "Speculation thatStarfieldwill soon be confirmed for release on PlayStation 5 ramped up over the weekend after fans spotted a PlayStation logo on Bethesda’s official Creations website.\n\nThe logo was attached to a work-in-progress ship decals Creation for Starfield, and although the Creation was removed, fans are speculating that Bethesda’s so-far PC and Xbox-only sci-fi game is soon set for PS5.\nThoughts inevitably turn to whether Bethesda plans a significant content update, possibly even a new expansion, to coincide with Starfield’s seemingly inevitable release on PS5. There’s been little to shout about when it comes to Starfield in recent months, following the launch of the poorly receivedShattered Space expansion. Bethesda parent company Microsoft is expected to hold another summer showcase this year, as it has done in recent years, and that event may be the right time and place to learn more about all things Starfield.\nBethesda itself has said it has \"exciting things\" planned for Starfield this year, amid growing discontent from players about a lack of communication and updates. In June 2024,Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supportingStarfield, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. In an interview withYouTube channel MrMattyPlays, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”\nStarfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new intellectual property in years, and its first mainline single-player game since Microsoft bought parent company ZeniMax Media in March 2021. IGN’sStarfield reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist.”\nIn January,Microsoft’s gaming boss Phil Spencer refused to rule out Starfield coming out on PS5.Starfield and MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were both reported as being considered for PS5 as far back as March 2024. Indy ended up confirmed for PS5 with a spring 2025 release window, a few months after its release on PC and Xbox Series X and S. But Starfield is yet to be confirmed for PS5, although Spencer's comments certainly suggested it was on the cards.\nA number of Xbox games are currently available on PS5, including Rare’s Sea of Thieves, Tango Gameworks’ Hi-Fi Rush, and Obsidian’s Grounded and Pentiment. Microsoft already publishes Minecraft games on PlayStation consoles, among many other platforms, and is set to publish Doom: The Dark Ages and Ninja Gaiden 4 on PS5 later this year. Playground’s Forza Horizon 5 is also confirmed as coming to PS5 soon. There are even reports thatMicrosoft is finally ready to release Halo on PlayStation after decades of Xbox exclusivity.\nSpencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.\n“We run a business,”Spencer said in August last year. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.\n“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”\nIt’s a busy time for the 450-person Bethesda Game Studios, which currently operates five teams: Starfield; Elder Scrolls 6; Fallout 76; mobile; and external development partnerships.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-fans-left-disappointed-after-flight-simulator-2025-store-page-labeled-copycat-shovelware",
    "full_text": "Fans quick to celebrate the reveal of a Microsoft Flight Simulator PlayStation Store page were left let down after it was discovered that the actual product is little more than “copycat shovelware.”\n\nXbox and PlayStation fans gathered to discuss a potential port for the popular flight simulation game afterReddit user CreativeRaspberry314 sharedTrophy information related to a potential PS4 and PS5 version earlier today. It would be exciting – ifnot somewhat unsurprising– to see Microsoft bring more Xbox titles to PlayStation fans, butthe spotted store pageisn’t officially related to Microsoft Flight Simulator in any way, shape, or form.\n“Sadly, this is just a copycat shovelware game,” oneReddit user added. “Straight up shovelware,” anotheradded. “Actually mental tbh, the picture is a straight up rip-off. If it was MSFS, it'd have the same achievements as the Xbox/Steam versions.”\nInstead, the Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation is being published by a company named Grizzly Games Limited. As spotted byEurogamer, the company shares a name with Thronefall developer Grizzly Games but is also completely unrelated to that entity. While that team is responsible for other titles like Superflight and Islanders, theGrizzly Games Limited websitereveals a catalog of what appear to be mobile games featuring glossy, AI-generated materials. The art for its Flight Simulator 2025 project also appears to be generated by AI judging by some of its muddy plane parts and strange designs.\nThe Thronefall team, meanwhile, provided a statement to Eurogamer related to the discovery of Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation and Grizzly Games Limited. Grizzly Games says it is not associated with the company, adding that it is using “both our name and logo illegally.”\n“Furthermore they seem to incorporate the absolute opposite of our values, of what we stand for and what we’re trying to give to the gaming community,” Grizzly Games continued. “Unfortunately our legal resources are limited as a two-person indie team, but honestly I'd love to see this kind of stuff being stopped, especially since it's not only happening to us but lots of indie devs that just lack the legal power.\"\nAs of this story’s publication, the Flight Simulator 2025 page remains live on the PlayStation Store. It describes an experience that “sets a new standard in aviation simulation, combining ultra-realistic flight dynamics with breathtaking visuals.” No gameplay for the project has been revealed.\n“Can shovelware just be banned from the store please? It’s packed to the brim with it and makes browsing an absolute chore,” anotherReddit user added. “I don’t remember it being this bad in prior generations.”\nPlayStationtook a standagainst what many refer to as “spam” titles in 2022. At the time, it was believed the move was made to fight back against easy-to-Platinum games, or titles that exist almost solely for the purpose of increasing players’ Platinum Trophy count. However, many shovelware titles still exist on the PlayStation Store andother digital storefrontstoday.\nWebrought a magnifying glass up to the issue last monthto take a closer look at how shovelware titles impact both gamers and developers. We spoke to multiple developers to learn more about not only how these games find their way onto digital storefronts but PlayStation, Nintendo, Xbox, and Valve’s vetting process.\nMichael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-assassins-creed-shadows-launch-to-the-perfect-storm-valhalla-benefitted-from-ubisoft-internal-email-says-compare-it-to-origins-odyssey-and-mirage",
    "full_text": "There is enormous pressure onAssassin's Creed Shadowsto do well for Ubisoft globally after a number of delays and the sales failure of last year’sStar Wars Outlaws. Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number ofhigh-profile flops,layoffs,studio closures, andgame cancellationsin the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release.\n\nThings have got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family isreportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investorson a buyout deal that would let it preserve control of the company's intellectual property.\nSo, the video game world is watching Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ early performance closely for signs of its success — or failure. So far, Ubisoft has yet to announce a sales figure, but has saidAssassin's Creed Shadows hit 2 million players just two days after launch, surpassing the launches of both Origins and Odyssey.\nThere’s also a lot of attention on Shadows’ Steam concurrents, which are being compared to those of other triple-A single-player games that recently released, as well as previous Assassin’s Creed games on Valve’s platform.\nShadows became the most-played Assassin's Creed game ever on Steam over the weekend with 64,825 peak concurrent players, although it’s worth noting that it was the first game in the series to launch day-one there since 2018's Odyssey. BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardsaw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.\nIt’s hard to make a call on whether Shadows is below, meeting, or exceeding Ubisoft’s expectations without knowing what those expectations were. But a source from within Ubisoft, who revealed an internal email reviewed by IGN, has helped us better understand the game’s first weekend performance.\nHere’s what we’ve found out: Shadows delivered the second-highest day-one sales revenue in the franchise’s history, behind only 2020’s Valhalla, which launched across the last and current generation of consoles and benefited from stay-at-home gaming fueled by the pandemic.\nShadows also marked Ubisoft’s best ever day-one launch on the PlayStation Store, suggesting particular success on PS5.\nBut what about PC, given Shadows launched on Steam as well as Ubisoft’s own digital store? According to Ubisoft’s internal communication, 27% of Shadows’ total “activations” were on PC. Ubisoft is telling employees that Steam “played a major role” in Shadows’ performance on PC, without revealing exact sell-through numbers. It says early results “are a strong validation of our decision to return to the platform.”\nGenerally, Ubisoft is talking up player engagement, which is at “record levels,” and “feedback across moderated, verified platforms — those less affected by review bombing — remains incredibly positive.” Shadows was also the most-wishlisted Ubisoft game of all time, and it’s doing better than any other Assassin’s Creed game on Twitch, even Valhalla.\nIt’s here that Ubisoft’s internal communication provides context on comparisons between Shadows’ launch and other games in the franchise. What’s clear is that Shadows is not doing as well as Valhalla did at launch, but Ubisoft is saying it’s not fair to compare the two, because Valhalla benefitted from the “perfect storm” of pandemic-fueled stay-at-home gaming and the launch of the Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5 in 2020.\n“Valhalla launched under extraordinary conditions — in the middle of a global pandemic, with widespread lockdowns and brand-new console hardware,” the internal communication reads. “It was a perfect storm we may never see again. That’s why it’s more meaningful to compare Shadows to entries like Origins, Odyssey, and Mirage — games released in more typical cycles. And in that frame, Shadows is already setting a new bar as illustrated above.”\nUbisoft also pointed out that Shadows released in March. Historically, Assassin’s Creed games launch just ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving window, which typically boosts sales. Meanwhile, Ubisoft ditched the early access period it normally charges extra for with its games. It’s also worth noting that Ubisoft’s own subscription offering is now available directly on Xbox, which affects sales on Microsoft’s console and muddies sales comparisons.\nMoney talks, of course, and irrespective of player numbers and engagement, it will be revenue brought in by Assassin’s Creed Shadows that determines the fate of not just the game, but Ubisoft itself. We may not get a clear picture of that until Ubisoft's next financial report in the coming months.\nAdventuring across feudal Japan?

    "full_text": "The Nintendo Switch 2 arrives on June 5, 2025, and it will likely be a hot commodity when it launches. Over on the official Nintendo store, the company is implementing some pre-order measures to ensure bona fide Switch players are getting their pre-orders.\n\nOn theMy Nintendo Store, those with a Nintendo Account can register their interest in pre-ordering a Nintendo Switch 2 system and \"select accessories\" from the Nintendo Store. Those who express interest will then get an invitation email once their turn in line comes up, valid for 72 hours. The catch? You'll need to have put in some time on your old Switch, and been a Switch Online member.\n\"Invitation emails will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis to registrants who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025,\" according to the fine print on the site.\nNintendo also notes that invitations are \"non-transferable\" and will be sent to email addresses associated with the Nintendo Account that registers interest. For the system and each accessory, there will also be a one-per-account limit during the invitation period. Currently on the site, you can express interest in either a base Nintendo Switch 2 system, or the one bundled with Mario Kart World.\nOrders will be shipped after purchase, and the approximate shipping date will be provided when ordering. Nintendo also specifies: \"Please note that release-day delivery is not guaranteed due to processing and shipment times.\"\nWhile not said outright by Nintendo, all of these measures seem dedicated towards ensuring that someone buying a Switch 2 through this process is someone who wants to purchase and play a Switch 2 for themselves, rather than flip it online.\nScalping has been a frequent problem for new releases of sought-after products. Notably, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S sawscalpers pursuing the new hardware, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game hasbeen dealing with ongoing scalping and shortages.\nValve found some success in its queue system for the Steam Deck, utilizing a method that tied Steam accounts to purchases alongside checks for whether an account was made before, or after, a certain window.It worked, and it's not surprising now to see Nintendo taking similar measures with the My Nintendo Store process.\nOf course, there will be other ways to pick up a Switch 2. But hopefully options like this can help some long-time Switch 1 owners avoid the potential chaos of locking down a launch day Switch 2 pre-order.\nEric is a freelance writer for IGN."

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-soon-integrate-its-copilot-ai-into-the-xbox-app-and-eventually-into-your-xbox-games",
    "full_text": "As a part of Microsoft's ongoing efforts toimplement artificial intelligence into basically everything, the company is preparing to introduce its AI Copilot into your Xbox experience to give you gaming advice, help you remember where you left off last time you played, and perform other tasks.\n\nAnnounced today, Copilot for gaming will be rolled out for Xbox Insiders through the Xbox mobile app sometime soon for testing. If you're not already aware, Copilot is Microsoft's existing AI chatbot (that replaced Cortana in 2023) that's already integrated into Windows. The gaming version will have a handful of features at launch. You can ask it to install games on your Xbox for you (a process you can already do now just by pushing a single button on the app), and you can also ask it about your play history (in case you forgot what you were doing last time you played), achievements, library, or for a recommendation of what to play next. You'll also be able to speak to Copilot for Gaming directly on the Xbox app while you're playing, and it will serve you answers in the same way Copilot currently does when asked questions via Windows.\nProbably the biggest use-cases touted by Microsoft available at launch is Copilot as a gaming assistant. You can already ask Copilot questions about games any time on PC, such as how to beat a boss or solve a puzzle, and it will source answers via Bing from various online guides, websites, wikis, and forums. Soon, you'll also be able to ask it those same questions on the Xbox app.\n\"Our goal is to have Copilot for Gaming source the most accurate game knowledge — so we are working with game studios to make sure the information Copilot surfaces reflects their vision, and Copilot will refer players back to the original source of the information.\"\nUnshockingly, Microsoft does not intend to limit itself to just these Copilot functions. In a press briefing, Microsoft spokespeople discussed other future possibilities for Copilot in video games, including as awalkthrough assistant to explain basic game functions, remember where items where left in a game, or tell you where to find new ones, or as a helper in competitive games that could offer strategy suggestions and tips in real-time to counter opponents' moves, or explain how and why an engagement unfolded the way it did. Though it was emphasized that these were both just ideas they were toying with, the presentation made clear that Microsoft is insistant on finding ways to integrate Copilot closely with regular Xbox gameplay. And Microsoft confirmed to me that it will eventually work with not just first-party studios, but third-party studios for integration into their games as well.\nWith that in mind, I asked Microsoft if Copilot gaming would be opt in or opt out of use, or if users could opt out of having their data used to train it. The answer is that yes, Xbox Insiders can opt out during the preview, but the door was left open for Copilot to be mandatory in the future. Here's what a spokesperson said:\n\"During this preview on mobile, players will be able to decide how and when they want to interact with Copilot for Gaming, whether it has access to their conversation history, and what it does on their behalf.\n\"As we preview and test Copilot for Gaming with players early, we will continue to be transparent about what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices players have around sharing their personal data.\"\nIGN understands that Copilot is not being limited to just player-focused usage, and that Microsoft will be providing an overview on plans for developer use in asession at the Game Developers Conference on Monday next week.\nRebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

    "title": "FBC: Firebreak Is the Control Multiplayer FPS I Didn’t Know I Wanted",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-20T21:45:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-is-the-control-multiplayer-fps-i-didnt-know-i-wanted",
    "full_text": "Control was IGN’s Game of the Year in 2019 – and I was one of the many editors that voted for it – but even I was skeptical when Remedy, a studio known for telling great single-player stories in third-person games, announced it was doing a Control multiplayer game. That project turned out to be FBC: Firebreak, a three-player PvE first-person multiplayer shooter set six years after the events of Control. And in the hands-off demo I saw, it very quickly became clear that my skepticism was completely unwarranted. Firebreak is refreshingly original in an oversaturated space, delightfully weird amidst a sea of same-y military and/or sci-fi online shooters, and perhaps best of all, it doesn’t require a massive commitment like so many of its contemporaries. As game director Mike Kayatta put it, \"We're not about daily check-ins. We're not interested in monthly grinds. We don't want to give anybody a second job.\" Say it again, Mike, for the people in the back.\n\nFBC: Firebreak is a three-player co-op FPS with, if what Remedy is promising comes to pass, no nonsense. You can play for 20 minutes or a few hours if you want to, with Perk unlocks and new combinations amongst characters keeping things fresh for repeat runs. But what the heck are you doing here, back in The Oldest House, with a bevy of bizarre weaponry in your hands? Essentially, you are volunteer first responders in The Oldest House when things go seriously sideways. Your characters are secretaries, rangers, and other “normal” occupations who heed the call of service. The Federal Bureau of Control wouldn’t say you’re expendable, but…you’re expendable.\nWhen you log in to play, you choose a Job (aka a mission) and a Crisis Kit (essentially, your loadout) before setting the Threat Level (difficulty) and Clearance Level, which determines how many zones you'll be playing through in a run. The zones are separated by containment doors, which will take you to the next stage of the Job. And the Job I saw is called Paper Chase, and it’s set in a fairly mundane office section of the FBC building. The Hiss are spreading, and it’s up to you and your two teammates to work together to beat them back.\nOf course, you can get the hell out of there as soon as you can if you like, but if you want to get your hands on currencies that let you upgrade and buy new gear, you have to escape safely with them. And the longer you spend exploring for currency, the harder it is to make it back to HQ in one piece.\nSpeaking of gear, that’s where FBC: Firebreak starts to set itself apart from other multiplayer shooters. Many of the guns are charmingly unusual, and most have a homebrew feel, like the hand-cranked snowball-launching gun that can put out fires (or your friends who are on fire) and soak the sticky-note monster (uh, more on him in a bit). Or the cobbled-together zapper that, when fitted with the right nozzle, can rain down lightning storms on a room full of bad guys. Or the large wrench that, when a squeaky piggy bank toy is attached, causes a swirl of coins to pelt your opponents. Don’t worry, though; there are still staples like a machinegun and shotgun – the latter of which is the go-to for after you’ve either soaked or zapped one of the sticky-note monsters.\nOh yes, about them: the entire point of this particular Job is to eliminate all of the sticky notes before they overrun the entire brutalist building. Note the number of sticky notes left to destroy in the upper left corner. It will actually go way up as the mission progresses because, by the end of it, you face off against…a gigantic sticky-note monster. Think Sandman from the end of Spider-Man 3, but made out of sticky Post-It notes instead of sand.\nBut it’s not just about weird weapons. There are also fun in-universe gameplay mechanics, too, like the office supply shelf that refills your ammo, the makeshift turret you build after literally dumping it out of a box onto the floor, the stereo speaker that keeps the Hiss at bay, and the rinse station that washes any aggressive sticky notes off of your face. Unlockable Perks also inject more spice and variety into the gameplay. A couple of examples I saw: a Perk where each missed bullet has a chance to return to your clip, and another that lets you extinguish yourself by jumping up and down. Also, if you get two of the same Perk you get a stronger version of it. If you get three, you can share the Perk’s effect with nearby teammates.\nBy the way, in case you’re wondering, you don’t have to have three people in order to play. You can play solo or in duos as well. Meanwhile, Remedy is aiming for a lower minimum PC spec than usual, but on the opposite end of the spectrum, FBC will also support DLSS4 with multi-frame generation as well as nVidia Reflex and full ray-tracing. It’ll also be Steam Deck verified, and it’s launching into Xbox and PC Game Pass on day one along with PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium. Finally, there is a post-launch content plan that Remedy isn’t ready to share quite yet, and there will be paid cosmetics, but that’s the extent of the microtransactions.\nIn fairness, I haven’t actually played FBC: Firebreak yet, so I have to be cautious about my enthusiasm. But so far, it certainly passes the eye test. This is almost certainly not a run-of-the-mill multiplayer shooter, in a very good way. And the fact that it’s a get-in and get-out online game that doesn’t require a massive ongoing time commitment in order to enjoy it is a refreshing throwback to the days when that was the norm.\nRyan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show,Podcast Unlocked, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show,IGN Unfiltered.

The S90C is a 2023 model, but it's a better TV than the2024 S85Dand nearly identical in image quality to the2024 S90D, which is currently selling for $200 more. Ideally you'll pair it with yourPlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or even theupcoming Switch 2 console.\n\nUpdate:This TV is also available onAmazonfor a little more.\nThe Samsung S90C is a slightly older 2023 model (superseded by theS90Dfor 2024), but it's still considered to be one of the best OLED TVs available. That's because the S90C uses Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. It's generally considered better than LG's \"Evo\" technology found on the C-series TVs, which attempt to do the same thing. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. At the moment, there's no better panel technology that's readily available at a reasonable price.\nOLED technology aside, the Samsung S90C also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz (rare in a 2023 TV) as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X.

Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times.\nOLED technology aside, the Samsung S90D also has all the features you'd want in agaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming console. The S90D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to the recently releasedPlaystation 5 Proconsole since it can drive more games in quality mode (native 4K @ 120fps) than the standard PS5, which often needs to be set to performance mode (upscaled 4K).\nIf you're looking for a smaller size, the 42\", 48\", and 55\" models are also on sale. The 42\" model is ideal for PC monitor use. At that screen size, the 4K resolution equates to a respectable 104ppi pixel density and supports chroma 4:4:4 subsampling for clear, legible text. The HDMI 2.1 input supports refresh rates of up to 144Hz over 4K resolution.\nFor this week only, Best Buy is offering the 77\" Samsung S84D 4K OLED smart TV for $1,499.99. That's only $150 more than the 65\" S90D model for a 40% larger screen size. The S84D is Best Buy's exclusive model that's identical to the S85D but with slightly better speakers (30W vs 20W). Compared to the S90D, the S84D is a step down in image quality since it doesn't utilize quantum dot technology and the refresh rate is limited to 120Hz instead of 144Hz. However, it's still an outstanding TV compared to other TVs on the market and an excellent value at this price.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "full_text": "Ubisoft has hailed anotherAssassin’s Creed Shadowsplayer milestone, but has yet to confirm a sales figure for the game.\n\nIn asocial media post, Ubisoft said Shadows has seen 2 million players since going on sale on March 20, up from the 1 million on day one.\nThat’s enough to surpass the launches of both Assassin’s Creed Origins and Odyssey, Ubisoft added. “Thank you for joining the journey in Feudal Japan!”\nIt’s an impressive start for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but it’s worth bearing in mind that Ubisoft has yet to announce a sales figure for the game. Still, we do know it’s the top-selling game on Steam, where Ubisoft recently returned after years of PC launch exclusivity on the Epic Games Store.\nAt the time of this article’s publication, Assassin’s Creed Shadows was on 58,894 concurrent players on Steam, enough to break into the top 30 most-played games on Valve’s platform. That peak is expected to rise as we continue into the game’s opening weekend.\nFor comparison, Origins’ all-time Steam peak was 41,551, over seven years ago, and Odyssey’s was 62,069. It seems likely Shadows will become the most-played Assassin's Creed game on Steam later this weekend.\nBioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardlaunched on Steam on Thursday, October 31, 2024, and saw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.\nThe true concurrent peak of Assassin’s Creed Shadows will of course be much higher, given it launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S also. Neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.\nThere is enormous pressure on Assassin's Creed Shadows to do well for Ubisoft globally after multiple delays and the sales failure of last year’sStar Wars Outlaws. Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number ofhigh-profile flops,layoffs,studio closures, andgame cancellationsin the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release. Things got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family and largest shareholder arereportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investorson a buyout deal that would let them preserve control.\nAssassin's Creed Shadows has also endured a number of controversies itself, not least in Japan. This week, IGN confirmed thatUbisoft had quietly released a day-one patch for Assassin’s Creed Shadowsthat made a number of important changes seemingly in response to concern from some Japanese politicians about in-game temples and shrines.\nIn a remarkable exchange this week, Japanese politician and member of the House of Councillors of Japan, Hiroyuki Kada, raised the issue of Assassin’s Creed Shadows in an official government meeting, andShigeru Ishiba, the Prime Minister of Japan, responded.\nOn Steam at least, Assassin's Creed Shadows is going down very well with players. It has a 'very positive' user review rating, with 81% of over 6,000 user reviews marked as positive. IGN’sAssassin’s Creed Shadows reviewreturned an 8/10. We said: “By sharpening the edges of its existing systems, Assassin’s Creed Shadows creates one of the best versions of the open-world style it’s been honing for the last decade.”\nAdventuring across feudal Japan?

We are beyond excited to start this journey with you!”\nWhile 1 million players on launch day is an impressive achievement, it’s difficult to gauge success when Ubisoft itself hasn’t offered a sales figure or indeed a sales target.\nWhat we do know is that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the top-selling video game globally on Steam right now. Valve’s chart sorts products by revenue, so we can say Ubisoft’s game is currently bringing in more money than any other on the platform.\nWe also have early days Steam concurrent figures. According to official stats from Valve’s platform, Assassin’s Creed Shadows hit a peak player concurrent figure of 41,412 on Steam on launch day.

    "full_text": "Microsoft has unveiled a list of Xbox Game Pass titles set to join the service in the first half of April 2025, revealing a strong lineup of first- and third-party games, including South of Midnight, Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition, Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls – Ultimate Evil Edition, and more.\n\nIt’s a remarkably strong month that was detailed in a recentXbox Wirepost. Expect major hitters to start dropping in tomorrow, April 3, kicking off the month with Gearbox Software’s Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition (Cloud, Console, and PC) for all tiers, while All You Need Is Help (Console), Still Wakes the Deep (Xbox Series X | S), and Wargroove 2 (Console) all join Game Pass Standard. There’s more than enough in this first block to keep even the most dedicated Xbox fan busy all month, but you’ll only have five days before South of Midnight (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) and Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls – Ultimate Evil Edition (Console and PC) arrive for all Game Pass subscribers April 8.\nSouth of Midnight, Compulsion Games’ Deep South-set folklore adventure, is poised to be one of Xbox’s biggest releases of the year, and its presence on Game Pass will no doubt have hordes of players seeing what it has to offer. Microsoft’s official description sheds more light on how it will bring some life to Game Pass this month: “Explore the mythos and confront mysterious creatures of the Deep South in this modern folktale while learning to weave an ancient power to surmount obstacles and face the pain haunting your hometown.”\nApril 9 follows with Commandos: Origins (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, with Blue Prince (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) coming to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass tiers April 10. Finally, Hunt: Showdown 1896 (PC) will round out the Wave 1 drops come April 15 when it is added for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers.\nXbox Game Pass perks are also getting a refresh for the first half of April 2025. Highlights include the Beyond the Void Bundle for The First Descendant, the Sweet Starter Pack for Candy Crush Solitaire players on mobile devices, and an anniversary Seventh Serving Emote for Sea of Thieves fans. You can see the full list of everything coming to Game Pass in the first half of April below.\nAnother month of Game Pass newcomers means another batch of games will soon be leaving, too. You’ll be losing access to these titles come April 15, so if you’re interested in playing but don’t think you’ll have time to reach the credits, Microsoft still offers a 20% discount for members looking to pick up a last-minute purchase.\nMichael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

    "title": "Is the Console War Finally Over?",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-08T17:30:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/is-the-console-war-finally-over",
    "full_text": "PlayStation or Xbox? It’s the long-running question of the modern video game world. At one point or another in your life, you’ve almost certainly been a part of this debate. Maybe you’ve started a Reddit thread, or made a TikTok video, or struck up a heated chat between friends about it. While therearegamers who preach the PC gospel, and Nintendo-as-god fanatics, much of the last two decades of video game history has been made as a result of Sony and Microsoft’s ongoing tete-a-tete. But is this ‘console war’ truly still being waged? The video game industry has gone through immense change in the last year, let alone over the previous two decades. Gamers’ habits, preferences, and options have all increased exponentially in part thanks to the rise of handheld gaming and younger generations’ expertise in building their own gaming machines. The battlefield is now practically unrecognisable compared to its tribal-like origins, but has a victor finally emerged from the trenches? Possibly – but the answer may surprise you.\n\nThe video game industry has rapidly evolved to become a financial juggernaut in recent years. In 2019, its worldwide revenue was $285 billion. Last year, it was $475 billion. That figure means that video games made more than the entire world wide movie and music industries in 2023, which made$308 billionand$28.6 billionrespectively. There’s no sign of this growth stopping, either. By 2029, the industry is estimated to generate nearly$700 billion. Not bad considering its humble Pong origins.\nAll this considered, it’s no surprise that we’ve seen an uptick in Hollywood actors flocking to be a part of a scene with such a lucrative present and future. Mads Mikkelsen, Keanu Reeves, Jon Bernthal and Willem Dafoe to name a few have all starred in games released in the past five years. Their involvement reflects the monumental shift in the perception of video games. Even industry titans like Disney are making significant in-roads into gaming, havingjust invested $1.5 billion into Epic Gamesas part of Bob Iger’s second term challenge to solidify a gaming presence for the company. A rising tide should lift all boats – unless you’re aboard the U.S.S. Microsoft, which seems to have sprung a leak.\nThe Xbox Series X and S consoles are intended to be an upgrade from the Xbox One in every way. But their advancements have yet to prove truly enticing; the One currently ranks above the Series X/S by almost double the sales. When you couple this fact with comments from analytics company Circana’s games industry expert, Mat Piscatella, who hassuggested that this current console generation is now past its selling peak, it paints a worrying picture for team Xbox. Things appear even worse when you look at console sales figures from 2024. According to Statista, the Xbox Series X/Ssold less than 2.5 million units across the entire year– the PlayStation 5sold the same figure in the first quarter of 2024 alone. There are also the allegations that Xbox is supposedly closing down its department which handles the manufacture and delivery of games to physical retailers, which feels ominously connected to itsevasive responseto areport that it plans to pull out of selling consoles in the EMEA region. If Xbox really has been involved in a ‘console war’, all of this points to the signal to retreat.\nBut Xbox isn't retreating – it has already surrendered. During the long Activision-Blizzard acquisition process, a statement from Microsoft found in the findings of fact revealed that the company doesn’t believe its Xbox division lost the console war –it thinks it never had a shot to begin with. So, what does a company built around a video game console do when its newest model is struggling to match its predecessor in sales, and its parent company openly remarks on its failure? It gets out of the console business.\nIt's no secret that Xbox Game Pass has become a key priority for the company.Leaked internal documentsrevealed the estimated prices Xbox expected to be asked to pay to put AAA-titles like Grand Theft Auto 5 ($12-15 million per month) and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor ($300 million) on the subscription service. Xbox taking such costs seriously demonstrates the company consolidating cloud gaming as a key direction for it moving forward. That goal is clear to see in Microsoft’s recent ‘This Is An Xbox’ advertising campaign, which suggests the company is keen to redefine how players think of Xbox – no longer a console, but an always-accessible service with some hardware to complement it instead.\nIt seems like this rethinking of what an Xbox is means that the brand’s official hardware won’t be limited to being a box under your TV. An Xbox handheld has been rumored to be in development for the past year or so, backed by another leaked document from the Activision-Blizzard dealings which hints at using handheld-friendly hardware for a next-gen'hybrid cloud gaming platform'. But Microsoft’s pivot in strategy has hardly been a secret. From its announcement of plans to createa mobile game storeto compete with Apple and Google, to Xbox chief Phil Spencer’s own admission that mobile gaming’s dominance in the sphere is shaping the company’s own path moving forward, the new M.O. seems simple: Xbox is the video game brand you can play whenever you want, wherever you are.\nSo why is Microsoft pivoting? Sure, Xbox has struggled over the past couple of generations, but doesn’t the video game console market reign supreme? You’d be surprised. In 2024, of the total 3.3 billion estimated video gamers,over 1.93 billion of them play via a mobile device. That, of course, includes your grandmother playing Candy Crush Saga and your “non-gamer” cousin who still clocks up hours of Clash of Clans. But mobile gaming is now so much more than these casual audiences – over the last decade it has quickly become the dominant pillar of the video game market among every generation, but especially Gen Z and Gen Alpha. In 2024, thetotal market valuation for the video game industrywas $184.3 billion, with mobile games comprising exactly half of that entire figure at $92.5 billion (a 2.8% increase from the previous year). Where do consoles weigh in? At just $50.3 billion, or 27%, and that’s dropped 4% since 2023. No wonder Microsoft wants to turn your phone into an Xbox.\nBut this isn’t a new development. By 2013, the Asian market for mobile gaming was already dwarfing that of the western world by heights of 759% in South Korea and 280% in China. You might think GTA 5 was the most profitable game of 2013, but you’d be wrong: Both Puzzle & Dragon and Candy Crush Saga outperformed Rockstar’s juggernaut by $1.5 and $1.4 billion respectively. Take a wide-angle lens to the 2010s as a whole for video games, and you’ll find that five of the highest-grossing games were mobile games – Crossfire, Monster Strike, Honor of Kings, Puzzle & Dragon, and Clash of Clans. When you look back on the decade, I highly doubt any of these titles immediately spring to mind – and yet, I’m sure most reading this have the start-up music for Clash of Clans seared into their brains.\nPhones are not the only platform drawing attention away from consoles. While not as significant as mobile gaming’s explosion, it’s clear to see that player habits have shifted toward a greater appreciation for PC gaming. Since 2014, there has been a year-on-year growth of 59 million new PC players, taking us from 1.31 billion in 2014 to1.86 billion in 2024. It’s worth noting this rise is complimented by a gargantuan 200 million in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic, during which streaming became a very attractive pastime for many house-bound players. But regardless of if Twitch called to them or not, gamers have become more technologically literate, educated by their peers online on how to build a PC powerhouse, what the best GPUs are, and how to overclock your circuit-ware. As a result, the PC’s global share of the video game market in 2024 lands at $41.5 billion – so it won’t be long until the PC battleline overtakes the army of console players, right? Well, maybe not.Netzoo’s 2016 Global Games Market Value reportdefined a $2.3 billion gap between console and PC – but in 2024, that gap has increased to $9 billion. So despite the rise of more advanced GPUs, circuit-boards, and Gen Z and Alpha’s technological craftiness, it’s a market that’s on thefallrather than the rise – at least for now. If that fall continues, it's not great news for Xbox, which has made Windows PCs its second home.\nBut it’s not just the dominance of mobile and the uncertain future of PC that Xbox has to contend with. Wars typically have two opposing sides, so it’s about time we looked at where PlayStation fits into this console war. Luckily for Sony, things are going pretty well. In its latest quarterly earnings report, Sony revealed75 million PS5s have been sold to date– that’s a big lead ahead of the combined 29.7 million sales for the Xbox Series X/S. The gap between the two consoles is widening, too; stats suggest that for every one Xbox Series X/S bought during November 2024,five PlayStation 5 consoles were also purchased(a ratio no doubt helped by the launch of the PS5 Pro.) Sony’s Game and Network Services also saw a healthy 12.3% bump in its profits during the final months of 2024, helped specifically by healthy first-party sales including Astro Bot selling 1.5 million copies in under two months, and lifetime sales for Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut surpassing 13 million. The future looks very bright for the PS5. Ampere Analysis’ games research director, Piers Harding-Rolls,estimates that by 2029, Sony will have sold 106.9 million consoles. How do things look for the Xbox Series X/S’s future? Well, leaked Microsoft documents estimate that by 2027,it expects to have sold around 56-59 million units. While it’s not a directly comparable projection, it’s not good. In order for Microsoft to re-establish its competitive edge in the current market, it will need to close the 5:1 PlayStation-to-Xbox gap, significantly increase the number of units sold year-on-year, and also bolster the profitability of its exclusives. Projections don’t support a positive outcome for those first two requirements, and given Phil Spencer’s ‘no red lines’ mantra on Xbox titles coming to PlayStation and Switch (possibly even including the next Halo title), the argument could be made that PlayStation is already the King of Console.\nBut looking at the PS5 in isolation paints a different picture. 50% of all PlayStation users arecurrently still playing on older PS4sinstead of PS5s, despite the newest generation now entering the second half of its life-cycle. Why is this? Well, of the top 20 best-selling games in the U.S. in 2024, only one is truly PS5-exclusive – Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, at #19. Helldivers 2 does feature at #3 but was also playable on PC at launch. Looking beyond last year, if we disregard remasters of PS4 games, there are roughly 15 genuine PS5-exclusive games on the console as a whole. There’s little here to justify the console’s price in many people’s eyes.\nIf the PS5 is struggling to justify its regular $500 price tag, then it's understandable why the $700 PS5 Pro debuted to a mixed reception to say the least. The general consensus amongst tech journalists is that perhaps this upgrade came tooearlywithin the cycle, especially given the games advertised in its campaign were slightly upscaled generation-old remasters. WhenIGN polled its readers, the result was overwhelmingly clear – the PS5 Pro has little to offer for forking over that much cash. So, simply put, the PS5 simply isn’t a must-buy console – at least, not yet. This will undoubtedly change when the behemoth that is Grand Theft Auto 6 finally releases later this year, which is almost guaranteed to become the shining star of this generation and the first chance for the PS5 to show off its true power.\nSo, is the console war over? If you’re Microsoft, it would appear there was never any belief that there was a chance to battle Sony for supremacy. If you’re Sony, your new console has become a success but lacks the true pedigree to be claimed as a new leap forward yet, feeling more like a bunny hop than anything else. The true winner of the console war seems to be those who chose not to play it at all. Rumors of mobile gaming companies encroaching onto the traditional console gaming sphere will only ramp up in the years to come, with Tencent rumored to be in talks to buy out Ubisoft from the Guillemot brothers, having already purchased Sumo Group in 2021. Mobile gaming is becoming increasingly pivotal to the sustainability and profitability of these companies – Take-Two Interactive claim that 10% of the world’s population plays its subsidiary Zynga’s games every month. That means that it’s more than likely that your grandma playing Zynga Poker and Words with Friends 2 is funding the continued development of Grand Theft Auto 6 – not a sentence you would expect to read five years ago, but one reflective of the new state of play of the video game market. The next five years of video gaming history will be defined less and less by who has the most powerful hardware, and more about whose cloud gaming server farm can expand the quickest and strongest. The console war is over, but the mobile gaming war (and the myriad of smaller conflicts that inevitably spin out of it) has only begun.\nSab Astley is a freelance writer who has written for IGN, Polygon, TotalFilm, Rolling Stone, Radio Times, and Metro UK.Editors note: this feature has been updated to better clarify sales figures of PlayStation and Xbox consoles."

    "title": "Haworth Fern Review",

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/haworth-fern-review",
    "full_text": "Haworth is one of the major players in the world of luxury seating. It has recently partnered with Xbox and its Halo franchise to deliver compellinghigh-end options to gamers. I've spent a good amount of time with its Haworth Fern, trimmed in a unique gradient color, to see if it's worth your investment. Spoiler alert, it's fantastic.\n\nErgonomic chairs have a tendency to blend together, but the Haworth Fern is at no risk of being confused with anything else. It has a unique wave-like design and open lumbar channel revealing its fronds, lending it a very unique and stylish appearance. You can pick it up in mesh, leather, or knit fabric, with prices ranging from $1,100 to just under $1,900.\nIt’s a luxury chair through and through, but through a partnership with Microsoft, it has locked gamers squarely in its sights. It offers both Xbox and Halo themed versions of its flagship Fern chair, as well as an Xbox version of its Very gaming chair. These themed versions lock down your choices, but I've yet to see one that doesn't look good. None are overstated, but are also clear matches for their source material. You don't need to worry about losing features if you opt for one of these, however. They are the same in features and comfort as the personalized versions you can craft yourself.\nIf you decide to configure your own, there's a huge array of customization options. There are four fabrics to choose from: mesh, digital knit, gradient knit, and leather. You can pick from six different colors of mesh and eight for the digital knit, a soft fabric that textures the backrest with tasteful chevrons. Digital Knit takes the same fabric but exchanges the chevron pattern for a gradient that extends from the top of the backrest to the waterfall edge of the seat, and there are five to choose from. Finally, there’s leather, which is available in black, gray, tan, and “luggage” which comes in a camel-like desert brown.\nThere's quite an array of additional configuration options too. You can outfit the chair with a headrest and an additional lumbar support, choose between 4D armrests or limit them to height only, add forward tilt to accompany the default backward tilt, and decide whether you want a plastic or aluminum base, as well as the finish you would like. All told, it’s one of the most configurable chairs I’ve reviewed. There’s a handful of quick-ship options but most are stated to ship in around five business days. Tan and luggage leather options are made to order and take about three weeks.\nNo matter which material you choose, every Fern comes with a fabric, cushioned seat and offers the same basic array of ergonomic adjustments. Whether you’re choosing an entry-level version or are opting for a top-of-the-line executive chair, it’s designed to be comfortable and supportive for long hours at a desk, and is made to look every bit the luxury that it is.\nIt all starts with the backrest. The Fern uses what Haworth calls the Wave Suspension System. This encapsulates the entire backrest, which is actually multiple parts that come together into a cohesive whole. The core of the system sits between the plastic rear frame and the front face. Behind the fabric, supporting your back, is a flexible “cradle.” This is a skeletonized grid sculpted to match the contours of your spine and provide structural support. It mates with the “fern” from which the chair takes its name. This piece quite literally looks like a fern with a “stem” in the center that’s surrounded by flexible “fronds.” The stem is a central channel for the optional adjustable lumbar support. The fronds are support leaves that work with the cradle to maintain targeted support as you sit and move throughout the day.\nThe Fern is considered a “high-back” chair, so the backrest reaches to the upper back. At 5’8”, it comes up to my shoulders. You can pick up an optional headset that mounts to the top and can move up and down but isn’t angle- or depth-adjustable. It truly does look like a wave and the contours guide you toward the center, aligning with the chair’s lumbar support.\nAround the back, the “stem” area is open, giving you a peek at the chair’s internals. If you pick up the added lumbar, its polished aluminum handle lives here, so it’s a functional feature as much as it is an aesthetic one. I recommend getting it if your budget can stretch that far. The chair’s natural contouring is good but the lumbar provides firm, targeted support and is one of the biggest ways you can guarantee that it provides exactly what your unique anatomy requires.\nThe seat is well padded with formed foam. Its contours guide you toward its center, aligning with the chair’s lumbar support. It's not exceptionally thick but is padded enough to hide the frame and remain comfortable without fear of it becoming too soft over time. On the right side, you'll find a lever to adjust its height, as well as a crank to raise or lower the recline tension. Another paddle controls the tilt lock, allowing you to adjust the recline from being locked upright to a deep recline. It's not a full lay like you'll find with a gaming chair. However, it's perfect for kicking back with a controller.\nThe armrests come in clutch here. They offer a wide degree of adjustability, much more than your average gaming chair despite sharing the same four axis of adjustment. When it comes to width, they can be tucked right in to support your elbows when holding a controller in your lap or set wide and out of the way. The cushions are soft but resilient. You can lean into them all day long without making yourself sore. I also like that they attach to the frame in thick aluminum channels, so if you do choose to lay your weight into them, you don't need to worry about damaging the plastic.\nThe headrest is also adjustable, but it's quite simple. It's fairly thin and just moves up and down. It's best positioned between the neck and head and does a good job of offering support there, but it lags behind some competing high-end task chairs, like the Steelcase Gesture, that allow you to angle and depth in addition to height. It gets the job done, but it's far from a make or break feature.\nThe Haworth Fern is an excellent chair that justifies its high asking price. I’ve been testing it for some time and have put it through its paces over long work days and gaming sessions. In both cases, it has performed exceptionally well and my back has been pain-free throughout. I was sent a gradient knit version, and it’s gorgeous: easily one of the most visually interesting chairs of its type. There was a bit of a wait time as it was made to order, but it is now available with standard shipping. The craftsmanship, quality, and final aesthetic were much worth the wait. The Fern lives up to the hype.\nAs a rule, chairs like this are fairly simple. They don't take long to wrap your head around, and the controls, while very important to understand and adjust properly, are straightforward once you understand what they do. I still recommend taking the time to read up each and try out slightly different positions and tensions until it feels just right for your body.I was a bit of a Goldilocks with this review, especially when it came to recline tension, but now that it’s set, I really only need to adjust the height and armrests and am glad I took the time for that initial setup.\nThe controls for the chair are well laid out and easy to use. I like that the seat depth slider is on the opposite side from the other controls and is set back a bit so you have to be intentional about making that specific adjustment. I was less likely to unlock the seat by accident, which is always a pain since the adjustment is so core to your comfort in the chair. I also liked that I didn’t have to get up to make depth adjustments. During initial setup, it definitely made it easy to find the right position and sped up the process.\nThe materials and build quality are also excellent. The Fern competes with the heaviest hitters in this industry and stands tall: it lacks nothing next to the Herman-Miller Embody, for example, or the Steelcase Leap V2. I would rank it right alongside those flagship offerings without a moment's hesitation. Haworth also offers an excellent 12-year warranty on its chairs. So should anything go wrong or become damaged from normal use, you have an assurance that your investment is protected.\nOver the course of this review, I sat in the chair for as long as 7 hours with minor standing breaks in between — without any time lost to assembly as it comes pre-assembled. I have used it reclined with a controller and sitting upright with a mouse and keyboard. I have typed tens of thousands of words, edited photos and videos, prepared spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations, and have generally lived a good chunk of my work life in the chair. And I have done all of that, gotten up, and moved on with my day without feeling any discomfort. It's a case where the chair is a fantastic match for my body.\nJust as importantly, it has left me feeling very satisfied with it as my daily driver. I walk into my office and enjoy seeing it at my desk. I appreciate the small details and the high quality craftsmanship throughout its design. And that gradient is just a chef’s kiss when it comes to unique and modern styling, balancing aesthetic with professionalism in a way that’s as at home in a professional office as it is in a gaming den.\nThe only criticism I really have of it, apart from its high price, is its headrest. It really does feel like an afterthought. And because of the way in which it is attached, through a slit in the fabric of the backrest, it’s not something you can remove and replace. I'm happy it's there, but I wish it offered more adjustability and support.\nTaken as a whole, it is fantastic, but there's no way around its high price. With that in mind, it's worth considering a chair like this as an investment in the quality of your work and gaming life. Even though it costs a tidy sum, broken up over the 12 years of its warranty, the yearly cost seems much more reasonable. While it certainly isn't for everyone, it's hard to argue that it's anything less than exceptional.\nThe Haworth Fern is availabledirectly from Haworthbeginning at $1,100 and extending to around $1,900. It’s available in mesh, Digital Knit, Gradient Knit, and Leather and in a wide range of colors and patterns. It is alsoavailable on Amazonfor a similar price; however, use caution if purchasing from third-party to ensure warranty coverage.\nThe Haworth Fern is exceptional in just about every way. It's comfortable, supportive, extremely well made and designed to last for years to come. It doesn't come cheap, just like other chairs of its caliber, but if you are looking for a chair that will return its investment in the quality of your daily desk life and pain-free time away, it's well worth considering."

While some of the other selections are £4.50 more, the whole selection of colours available for these Series X|S controllers has had a price reduction, so you're getting at least 33% off whichever one you like most.\n\nAs a second or spare controller for your Xbox Series X or S console, along with supported games on PC, all those on sale at Amazon right now include the following colours:\nAlthough the standard Carbon Black and Robot White—those bundled with the Xbox Series X & S consoles respectively—have been reduced to the lowest price of £35.99, all of the alternative colors have been dropped to a slightly higher yet still impressive £40.49. If you're in need of a new controller to play the newest games, likeCall of Duty: Black Ops 6which is on sale now as well, this is a fantastic opportunity.\nYou have to flaunt Amazon a little bit more of your cash to add a splash of style to your setup with one of these vivid color schemes likeAstral Purple, but it does seem worth it. What's more, these other models include the controller's updated design, featuring the X, A, B, and Y buttons being switched from their respective blue, green, red, and yellow colours to match that of their controllers' body.\nThe original button colours are still shown as tiny dots next to each one, but this update overall gives the controllers a more modest, sleeker appeal that arguably justifies the slightly larger price investment.\nFor those after a controller with a design that boasts more than one solid colour, Amazon UK also has the Special Fire Vapor Edition of the Xbox Series X|S controller as well,reduced by 20% to £51.99. Featuring titular vapor-like red-and-orange swirls, this bold colour scheme will invoke a little extra energy into your console setup if that's what you're looking for.\nBen Williams– IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

Amazon is offering atwo-pack of aftermarket rechargeable batteries for your Xbox controllerfor a mere $11.69 after you clip both coupons (20% off and 50% off) on the product page. That's just $5.85 per battery pack. As a comparison, the official MicorosoftPlay & Charge Kitwill run you $25, and that is for a single battery pack.\n\nThese rechargeable battery packs from \"6amLifestyle\" are compatible with both thecurrent generation Xbox Series X|S controllersand theolder Xbox One controllers. A nice feature of these battery packs is that they work with the stock USB port on the Xbox controller. Most other rechargeable packs have their own little port elsewhere that you need to use. A quality 10ft USB Type-C cable is included as well as a USB Type-C to Micro USB adapter for the legacy Xbox One controller. The cable is pretty cool because it has a little light that glows red when charging and blue when fully topped off.\n6amLifestyle states that each battery pack can last up to 35 hours of continuous playtime and can charge from empty to full in about three hours. That's pretty similar to the Play & Charge Kit's claim of 30 hours of playtime and four-hour charge time, which makes sense since both packs have the same 1,400mAh capacity. Having two batteries also means you can immediately swap over to another pack when the first one is depleted, thus minimizing your downtime.\nLooking for more Xbox deals?

    "full_text": "It’s the final day ofAmazon’s Big Spring Sale. Luckily, we’re still seeing plenty of massive deals dropping, and if you’ve got the Xbox Series X or S you won’t want to miss this one. Both the 2TB and 1TBWD_Black C50drives are on sale.  The 2TB option has $60 knocked off the list price, while you can score the 1TB drive for 30% off. Those are the lowest prices we’ve seen in 2025!\n\nGiven the Series X comes with only 1TB of storage (and it’s not all usable) and the Series S slashes that space almost in half, an expansion card is one of thebest Xbox accessoriesyou can grab, especially if you’ve got a healthy library of games. However, not all expansion cards are created equal, as only some let you run Xbox games directly from the SSD. The WD_Black C50 is one of the few that do, which is why it’s one ofIGN’s top SSDs for Xbox Series X|S.\nThe WD_Black C50 is a simple plug-and-play solution, easily slotting into the console’s expansion slot. It’s basically NVME SSD storage specialized for Xbox, but far simpler to set up than many of thebest PS5 SSDs. In a matter of minutes, the drive will be ready to install and play games. Compared to the Xbox’s internal storage, games should feel exactly the same, thanks to the expansion card’s Xbox Velocity Architecture. Transfer speeds will be just as snappy while boot times will only be marginally slower.\nIf you’ve got a massive collection of games that you want ready to play at a moment's notice or even just a couple of games that take up the lion's share of the storage, Western Digital’s discounted 2TB drive is the way to go. For smaller needs, you can’t go wrong with the 1TB option. Still, no matter which size you grab, the compact, durable design makes the external SSD an ultra-portable storage solution for the Xbox Series X|S. Plus, it’s one of the few options officially licensed by Xbox."

You can get a brand new importedXbox Series XandPlayStation 5consoles for much lower than you can find a new model elsewhere. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming consoles that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by your account, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item. These consoles all ship locally from the United States and usually arrive within one week.\n\nAliExpress as a whole is a legitimate website, but since it is a marketplace comprised of individual sellers, you have to make sure that the vendor you're buying from is reputable. In many cases, the easiest way to do so is to look at the seller's rating and history. In terms of the products we've listed in this article, while it's true that some of the sellers may not have many reviews,AliExpress has reached out to us and personally vetted these vendors, which is why we feel comfortable promoting them.

Note that this is a Hong Kong or Japanese import model in new retail packaging, but you won't find it cheaper anywhere else. Aside from the different color scheme, the Core controller is identical to the Xbox Elite Series 2 non-Core controller. The Core controller, however, does not include the component pack. AliExpress offers a 90-day return policy.\nAliExpress also just dropped the price on a new retail boxed (imported) Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 wireless gaming controller – component pack included – to $100 shipped.

    "full_text": "The modder who releaseda playable recreation of the Grand Theft Auto 6 map in Grand Theft Auto 5has ceased all work on the project after being hit by a takedown from Rockstar owner Take–Two.\n\n‘Dark Space’ had created a free-to-download playable GTA 5 map based on leaked coordinate data and official trailer shots of GTA 6, and uploaded gameplay footage to his YouTube channel. His videos and his mod hit the headlines in January as information-starved GTA fans flocked to experience a fan-made approximation of what they can expect to play officially when GTA 6 launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S this fall.\nThen, last week, Dark Space received the dreaded strike notification from YouTube after Take-Two issued a copyright removal request. If a YouTube channel receives multiple copyright strikes, it runs the risk of being terminated.\nIn response, Dark Space removed all download links to his mod, despite the fact he has yet to be asked to do so by Take-Two, and publisheda response videoon his channel calling out the company for its actions and suggesting it was the result of the mod's take on GTA 6's map being \"probably a little too accurate.\"\nDark Space was more philosophical in a follow-up interview with IGN. “I expected this would happen based on their past takedowns,” the modder said. “I went into this project knowing it was a possibility, and the fact that it happened does not surprise me.”\nDark Space said he believes Take-Two went after his mod because it was based on an online GTA 6 community mapping project that uses leaked coordinate points to “perfectly” map out the upcoming virtual space, and as a result might have ruined the surprise for players and the internet at large.\n“That's probably the biggest red flag, although most of the work in my map was based on the trailer shots,” Dark Space added.\n“I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get. If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too.”\nThe upshot is Dark Space’s GTA 6 mod project is no more. And that’s not just for YouTube videos of it, that’s for the entire thing. “Well they clearly do not want this project to exist,” Dark Space said. “So it's not just under threat, it's eliminated. There’s no point putting more time into something that goes directly against what they’re willing to allow.\n“I'm just going to keep making videos that people hopefully like. I probably won't do anything else modding GTA 5 in relation to GTA 6, since it seems dangerous.”\nThere are now concerns that the GTA 6 community mapping project could be next in Take-Two’s sights. IGN has contacted the group for comment.\nTake-Two has a history of taking down fan projects, most recentlythe YouTube channel belonging to the makers of the ‘GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition,’which ports the world, cutscenes, and missions from 2002’s Vice City into 2008’s GTA 4.\nOne former Rockstar developer has defended the company’s actions here, saying both Take-Two and Rockstar are protecting their business interests.\n“Take2/R* are a commercial company,” former Rockstar Games technical director Obbe Vermeijtweeted. “They will take down mods that interfere with their business interests.\n“The VC NextGen Edition mod for GTA4 directly competes with the Definitive Edition. The Liberty City preservation project (GTA4 in GTA5 engine) would interfere with a possible GTA4 remaster. (No idea whether they’re working on that. I think they should.)\n“There’s no point getting angry about it. This is what companies are supposed to do. The best we can hope for is that they allow mods that don’t interfere with their business. Such as DCA3 (GTA3 for Dreamcast). Afaik they have recently been decent about letting these projects continue.”\nWhile you wait for GTA 6 to come out, check out IGN’s coverage of an ex-Rockstar dev who saysthe studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025, Take-Two boss StraussZelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out, and the expert opinion onwhether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "title": "How Assassin's Creed Shadows Makes the Most of Its “Boring” Setting",

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/how-assassins-creed-shadows-makes-the-most-of-its-boring-setting",
    "full_text": "In 2012, Assassin’s Creed 3 director Alex Hutchinson called out people on the internet for suggesting the most “boring” future settings for the series. “The three most wanted [settings for Assassin’s Creed] are WWII, feudal Japan and Egypt,” he explained at the time, adding “They’re kind of the three worst settings for an AC game.” Hutchinson later clarified his statement, saying “the point I was trying to make was that in the broad strokes and scale of history, that’s a theme that’s been well-mined in video games.” He’s not wrong and since he made his most recent comments, Ghost of Tsushima, Rise of the Ronin, Nioh and more have all shone a spotlight on feudal Japan.\n\nFast-forward to 2025 and Assassin’s Creed is finally going to one of these “worst” settings with Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, but Shadows director Jonathan Dumont believes his team has found a new way to tell the story of feudal Japan.\n\"I think it's not boring at all. The setting is very exciting,\" Dumont says when asked about Hutchinson’s quote. \"I do think that being able to bring it to life and have that balance of the political intrigue [of the era], the war and conflict, and also the beauty of nature and supporting more exploration within this changing world give it another dimension [compared to other games].\"\nHutchinson wasn’t wrong back in 2012. The setting of Feudal Japan has indeed been one of the most requested locations for the Assassin's Creed series. Bringing the series' unique blend of historical fiction and sci-fi to the backdrop of warring states and samurai in fierce conflict seemed like a no-brainer for developer Ubisoft to make happen sooner rather than later. The only problem was Ubisoft chose later, perhaps to its detriment.\nThough Ubisoft has been praised for exploring previously overlooked historical settings like Egypt and Industrial Revolution England, other developers have beaten Ubisoft to open-world stealth-action games set in Japan with titles like Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Tsushima. That said, shows like FX’s Shogun prove that people’s appetites for samurai action hasn’t waned in the least. Much like Shogun, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows explores how outsiders navigate the courts and politics of feudal Japan. And the Assassin’s Creed name has a built-in reputation all on its own.\nDumont highlights the conflict and historical impact of the era – particularly in how Japan was \"opened up\" to the rest of the world for the first time following the arrival of Portuguese merchants and missionaries during the late 1500s Sengoku era.\n\"What made the setting interesting for us to tackle was the political landscape of the time, along with the arts and the environment of that era. We've seen other games do it before, but not in the Assassin's Creed way that we're doing it,\" says Dumont. \"We also have that big open-world feeling with the big cities, the wilderness, and we really touch upon the historical arts and the reconstruction of these locations to make it real for that time. So I don't think we've seen that necessarily in a lot of games [covering this era] – to truly explore and bring you into that world.”\nAccording to Dumont, the political intrigue of the era made it a particularly compelling setting to tackle for Assassin's Creed. A key difference he highlights that makes Shadows different from other games is how it brings a more dynamic and deeper dive into a politically troubled era filled with conflict – one that players will be able to immerse themselves in and learn more about almost from the moment the game begins.\nThere is also the matter of new technology that Ubisoft utilized in order to bring its version of Japan to life.\n\"The team was very enthusiastic about Assassin's Creed's take on Feudal Japan, and we felt that the latest technological improvements and new consoles would help us bring that vision to life,\" says Dumont. He highlights the dynamic weather and seamless open-world, and according to our review, the team seemingly succeeded in creating one of the best historical locations in Assassin’s Creed history.\nRemember, the Assassin’s Creed series began during the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 era, and since then technology has come a long way, with 4K resolution, bigger open worlds with greater density, and ray-tracing now standard on consoles and PC.\n\"What that does is give a much more 'alive' feeling than what we've done in the past [with other games],\" he continues. \"So I think that technology that took a few years to develop is omnipresent and all around you within the game. It does bring another dimension of being able to see the world in different states – which gives it more depth. It would not have been possible to make Shadows without our current technology; I don't think we would have gotten that feeling of losing ourselves in this open world without it.\"\nWhat makes the Assassin's Creed series so compelling is how it takes historical settings and injects its patented stealth-action gameplay and open-world immersion to make them all the more engrossing. Assassin's Creed Shadows leans into the samurai and ninja fantasy, much like other games tackling this setting. And the need to one-up the competition presented a big challenge to ensure the game's scope was well realized – and given the lengthy wait for the series to tackle a Japan setting, Dumont felt the wait was worth it.\n“It's really all about keeping the vision there, and the team keeps pushing for better quality in every aspect,” he says. “There's always a challenge with trying to meet people's expectations, and we also put the pressure on ourselves to do the best we can.\"\nFor more on Assassin's Creed Shadows, check outIGN's review of the game.\n"

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-is-having-its-halo-moment-with-the-dark-ages",
    "full_text": "The last thing I expected Doom: The Dark Ages to remind me of was Halo 3. And yet, half way through a recent hands-on demo with id Software’s gothic prequel, I was mounted on the back of a cyborg dragon and unleashing a salvo of machinegun fire across the side of a demonic battle barge. With the vessel’s defensive turrets destroyed, I landed my beast atop the ship and proceeded to charge through its lower decks, turning the entire crew into a few gallons of red slop. Seconds later, the warmachine was toast and I burst through its hull, leaping onto my dragon to continue my crusade against the machines of Hell.\n\nThose familiar with Bungie’s landmark Xbox 360 shooter will instantly recognise the shape of Master Chief’s assault on the Covenant’s scarab tanks. The helicopter-like Hornet may have been swapped for a holographic-winged dragon and the giant laser-firing mech for an occult flying boat, but the core of the experience is all here: an aerial assault that transitions into a devastating boarding action. Surprisingly, this wasn’t the only moment in the demo that reminded me of Halo. While the combat core of The Dark Ages is unmistakably and singularly Doom, the campaign’s design seems to have a very “late-2000s shooter” spin thanks to its love of elaborate cutscenes and a greater push for gameplay novelty.\nAcross two and a half hours I played four levels of Doom: The Dark Ages. Only the first of them, the campaign’s opener, resembled the tightly paced, immaculately mapped design of Doom (2016) and its sequel. The others saw me piloting a colossal mech, flying the aforementioned dragon, and exploring a wide-open battlefield dotted with secrets and powerful minibosses. It’s a big departure from Doom’s usual pursuit of mechanical purity, instead feeling akin to the likes of Halo, Call of Duty, and – weirdly – old James Bond games like Nightfire, all of which thrive on scripted setpieces and novelty mechanics that guest star for a mission or two.\nThis is a fascinating direction for Doom to head in, because once upon a time the series made something of a U-turn away from this. The cancelled Doom 4 was set to resemble Call of Duty, not only due to its modern military aesthetic but also thanks to an increased emphasis on characters, cinematic storytelling, and scripted events. After years of work id Software concluded that such ideas simply weren’t a good fit for the series, scrapping them in favour of the much more focused Doom (2016). And yet, in 2025, here they are in The Dark Ages.\nMy demo opened on a long and elaborate cutscene, (re)introducing the realm of Argent D'Nur, the opulent Maykrs, and the Night Sentinels – the knightly brothers-in-arms of the Doom Slayer. The big guy himself is depicted as a terrifying legend; a nuclear-level threat on two legs. While all of this lore will be familiar to Doom obsessives who poured over the prior games’ codex entries, the deeply cinematic approach with which it’s now presented feels very new. Very different. Very Halo. That continues into the levels themselves, with NPC Night Sentinels scattered about the environment akin to UNSC Marines. While they don’t fight alongside you (at least not in the levels I demoed) there’s certainly a greater sense that you’re part of an army – like Master Chief, you’re the invincible spearhead of a large force.\nThere’s a lot of character work in the introductory cutscene and it remains to be seen if this is something Doom really needs. I’m a big fan of the prior games’ slight approach to story, and part of me would rather The Dark Ages continued to tell the Slayer’s tale through environment design and codex entries, reserving cinematics only for the big reveals à la Eternal. But while I have my reservations, the cutscenes thankfully know their place: they tee up a mission and are never seen again, refusing to interrupt Doom’s signature intense flow.\nThere are interruptions in other forms, though. After that opening mission, which starts with pure shotgun slaughter and ends with you parrying Hell Knights using the Slayer’s incredible new shield, I was thrown into the cockpit of a Pacific Rim-like Atlan mech and asked to wrestle demonic kaiju. After that, I was soaring through the skies on that cybernetic dragon, taking down battle barges and picking off gun emplacements. These tightly scripted levels create a significant gear shift, punctuating the campaign’s rapid pace with new gameplay ideas that are reminiscent of Call of Duty’s biggest novelties, such as Modern Warfare’s AC-130 gunship sequence or Infinite Warfare’s dogfighting missions. The Atlan is slow and heavy, and the skyscraper-high perspective makes Hell’s armies look like Warhammer miniatures. The dragon, meanwhile, is fast and agile, and the shift to a wide-angle third-person camera results in a very different experience that feels a dimension away from classic Doom.\nMany of the best FPS campaigns thrive on this kind of variety. Half-Life 2 and Titanfall 2 are the gold standard for it. Halo has endured so long partly because its mix of vehicular and on-foot sequences provides it with a rich texture. But I’m unsure if this will work for Doom. As with Eternal, The Dark Ages is once again a wonderfully complex shooter to play – every second demands your complete attention as you weave together shots, shield tosses, parries, and brutal melee combos. In comparison, the mech and dragon sequences feel anemic, stripped back, and practically on-rails – their combat engagements so tightly controlled they almost resemble QTEs.\nIn Call of Duty the switch to driving a tank or firing from a circling gunship works because the mechanical complexity of such scripted sequences isn’t that far removed from the on-foot missions. But in The Dark Ages there’s a clear gulf between gameplay styles, so much so it’s akin to a middle school guitar student playing alongside Eddie Van Halen. And while I know Doom’s core combat will always be the star, when I’m beating the snot out of a giant demon with a rocket-powered mech punch I shouldn’t be wishing I was back on the ground using a “mere” double-barrelled shotgun.\nMy final hour of play saw The Dark Ages shift into another unusual guise, but one built on what feels like a much sturdier foundation. “Siege” is a level that returns its focus to id’s best-in-class gunplay, but it opens up Doom’s typically claustrophobic level design into a huge open battlefield, its geography shifting between narrow and wide to provide a myriad of pathways and combat arenas. The goal, to destroy five Gore Portals, has the same energy as Call of Duty’s multi-objective, complete-in-any-order missions, but I was reminded once more of Halo – the grand scale of this map versus the tighter routes of the opening level evokes the contrast between Halo’s interior and exterior environments. And, like Halo, the novelty here is that the excellent core shooter systems are given new context in much larger spaces. You must rethink the effective range of every single weapon in your arsenal. Your charge attack is employed to close football field-length distances. And the shield is used to deflect artillery fired from oversized tank cannons.\nThe downside of expanding Doom’s playspace is that things can become a little unfocused – I found myself backtracking and looping through empty pathways, which really does kill the pace. It’s here I’d like to have seen The Dark Ages veer even closer to Halo by throwing the dragon into the mix and using it like a Banshee; being able to fly across this battlefield, raining down fire before divebombing into a miniboss battle, would have helped maintain the pace and make the dragon feel more integral to the experience. If such a level exists beyond what I’ve seen, I’ll be very happy.\nRegardless of the overall shape of the full campaign, though, I am fascinated that so much of what I’ve seen feels like a resurrection and reinterpretation of ideas that were once considered an ill-fit for the series. Very little of the cancelled Doom 4 was released for the public to see, but aKotaku reportfrom 2013 paints a distinct picture. “There were a lot of scripted set pieces,” a source told the publication, among them allegedly an “obligatory vehicle scene.” And that’s exactly what we’ve got in the Atlan and dragon sections – mechanically simple scripted sequences that hark back to the novelty vehicle levels of Xbox 360-era shooters.\nTalking to Noclipin 2016, id Software’s Marty Stratton confirmed that Doom 4 “was much closer to something like [Call of Duty]. A lot more cinematic, a lot more story to it. A lot more characters around you that you are with throughout the course of the gameplay.” All that was scrapped, and so it’s genuinely fascinating to see so much of it return in The Dark Ages. This is a campaign set to feature big boarding action setpieces, lusciously rendered cinematics, a much wider cast of characters, and huge lore reveals.\nThe question now is: were those ideas always a bad idea for Doom, or were they just a bad idea when they looked too much like Call of Duty? Part of me is just as skeptical as the fans who once decried “Call of Doom”, but I’m also excited at the idea of id Software finally making that approach work by grafting it on to the now-proven modern Doom formula.\nThe beating, gory heart of The Dark Ages unquestionably remains its on-foot, gun-in-hand combat. Nothing in this demo suggested that it will not be centre stage, and everything I played affirms it's another fantastic reinvention of Doom’s core. I think that alone is strong enough to support an entire campaign, but id Software obviously has other designs. I’m surprised that a couple of the studio’s new ideas feel so mechanically slim, and I am concerned that they will feel more like contaminants than fresh air. But there’s still a lot more to see, and only in time will these fractured demo missions be contextualised. And so I eagerly await May 15th, not just to return to id’s unrivaled gunplay, but to satisfy my curiosity. Is Doom: The Dark Ages a good late-2000s FPS campaign or a messy one?\nMatt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor."

    "full_text": "Dinosaur survival gameArk 2, which some had suspected might have run into trouble or even been abandoned, is back on after developer Studio Wildcard revealed a new expansion forArk: Survival Ascendedthat leads into the sequel.\n\nArk: Lost Colony is the first original expansion pack for Ark 1 remake Ark: Survival Ascended, and its reveal trailer, below, was produced by anime studio Mappa (Jujutsu Kaisen, Attack on Titan, Chainsaw Man) and stars voiceover by the Michelle Yeoh, who reprises her role as Mei Yin from Ark: The Animated Series.\nStudio Wildcard said the expansion will feature numerous cinema-grade anime story sequences created by Mappa. Here’s the official blurb:\nIn its note to press, Studio Wildcard said Ark: Lost Colony “directly connects” the storylines of Ark’s Extinction and Genesis expansions and leads into the events of Ark 2.\nArk 2 is the Unreal Engine 5-powered sequel to the hugely successfulArk Survival Evolved. It was first announced with a surprise Vin Diesel cameo at The Game Awards 2020, at the time with a 2022 release date, but it was later delayed into 2023. Then, earlier in 2023,Ark 2 was delayed again, this time to late 2024 as an Xbox Series X and S console exclusive, day-one on Game Pass, and on PC via Steam and Windows.\nAs recently as December 2023,Studio Wildcard was still insisting Ark 2 was on track for a late 2024 release window. Obviously that didn’t happen, sparking concern from fans. So this announcement, coming three months into 2025, will help reassure fans that Ark 2 is still in the works, although Studio Wildcard failed to provide an updated release window.\nWe do have firmer details for Ark: Lost Colony, however. Pre-orders kick off in June 2025, and all purchases immediately unlock exclusive Ark: Lost Colony preview gameplay content. A full release is set for November 2025, with Ark: Lost Colony priced at $29.99 for Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, and PC.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

    "full_text": "The globe-trotting World of Assassination trilogy of IO Interactive's Hitman series is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 asHitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition. And alongside arriving in the Switch 2 launch window, Agent 47 will also be donning some new, appropriately Nintendo-themed duds.\n\nOnIO Interactive's site, the developer confirmed Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition will go up for pre-order soon, for both digital and physical editions. A pre-order of the digital edition will get you the Signature Pack, which includes two red-and-white outfits for Agent 47, a golden wrench, and a mushroom. Mushroom effects unknown at this time.\nPhysical pre-orders, meanwhile, offer both the Signature Pack and the Quack Pack, which offers a Luigi-themed green-and-grey suit and a green rubber duck. Much like a bald guy in a red tie and suit at a Paris fashion show, nothing unusual to see here.\nLess-than-subtle references aside, it's fun to see Agent 47 get some Nintendo attire. Other games likeBayonettaandThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrimgot their own Nintendo crossover cosmetics, and Agent 47 certainly has earned a bit of Nintendo theming of his own.\nThe World of Assassination spans a trilogy of games, as Agent 47 undertakes a number of missions to assassinate targets and complete contracts for his clientele. Starting with 2016's Hitman, the WoA trilogy runs up through Hitman III, whichIGN gave a 9, saying: \"Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is one of the barcoded butcher's best appearances.\"\nHitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition combines all of it together into one package. This includes the main campaign, contracts mode, escalations, Elusive Target arcades, and featured live content for Hitman, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3. Also included is the Freelancer game mode, a roguelike option for those who want even more variety and options in their Hitman experience.\nCurrently, Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition is due to arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in June 2025. Its also available now on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, the original Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation PS VR2.\nEric is a freelance writer for IGN."

    "full_text": "Bethesda has announced that MachineGames’Indiana Jones and The Great Circlelaunches on PlayStation 5 on April 15 for early access ahead of a global release on April 17. Those whopre-ordergetaccess to the early access.\n\nThe PS5 release date, which comes four months after Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launched on Xbox and PC, was announced alongside a playful promo trailer that sees perhaps the two most famous video game actors in the world on-screen together.\nIn the trailer, Indiana Jones actor Troy Baker sits down for a chat with Uncharted star Nolan North, who famously plays intrepid explorer Nathan Drake in the PlayStation-exclusive series. Drake and the Uncharted series are of course heavily inspired by Indiana Jones, so this meeting of the actors who play the characters is a full circle moment for The Great Circle itself.\nThere’s an added layer here, which is the Microsoft-owned Bethesda has drafted in Nolan North, the actor behind the Sony-owned franchise Uncharted, for a chinwag in one of its adverts. Now, at no point does North say ‘Nathan Drake’ or ‘Uncharted’ or anything that might legally belong to Sony Computer Entertainment, but his delivery in the video is knowing indeed.\nDrake — I mean North — playfully suggests he broke into the lavishly decorated room in which he’s sat and so doesn’t have much time to talk. The suggestion here is goons might burst through the door at any moment, as they tend to do when Nate is rummaging through drawers on the hunt for clues.\nNorth asks Baker how he’s going to deal with Private Military Forces with just a whip. Baker points to his head, saying, “use the old—” “headbutt,” North interjects. “I like it. Aggressive.” North says he’s “more of a sidearms kinda guy… jeans… henley,” and, as Baker quips, “somehow always half-tucked.”\nBoth North and Baker then bond over a shared enthusiasm for ancient artefacts, although North wants to sell them to the highest bidder, while Baker wants to donate them to a museum. This is Nathan Drake accepting the new Indiana Jones into a “very exclusive club” of adventurers. “Welcome to the club,” North declares. Xbox’s Indiana Jones now sits proudly alongside PlayStation’s Uncharted on Sony’s console, treasure-hunters in crime. All that’s left is for Lara Croft to break through the window and say something about not wanting the boys to have all the fun.\nThis is all part of Microsoft’s now-established multiplatform push, which has already seen a number of Xbox games launch on rival consoles. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is just the latest to make the jump, with Playground’s Forza Horizon 5, Id Software’s Doom: The Dark Ages and, reportedly, many more Microsoft-made games not far behind.\nBoosted by launching day one on Game Pass, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has so farreached 4 million players— a figure that will no doubt see a significant boost once the PS5 version goes live.\nIndiana Jones actor Harrison Ford has saidTroy Baker playing the beloved character in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is proof \"you don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul.\"\nFord discussed alleviating control of Indy withThe Wall Street Journal, saying he was very happy with the performance of The Last of Us actor Baker.\n\"You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul,\" Ford said. \"You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent. He did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.\"\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

It has a native 120Hz panel as well as two HDMI 2.1 ports that can run games in 4K at up to 120fps on a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming console. The OLED panel benefits from a near instantaneous response time (sub 0,.03ms) and supports features like variable refresh rate (VRR) including G-SYNC and auto low latency mode (ALLM). Note that despite this being a Sony TV, it pairs equally well with an Xbox console.\nSony OLED TVs use Google TV as its smart interface. Google TV is intuitive to use and supports voice commands through Google Assistant. You can also pair it with an Android phone to use as a remote.\nYou don't have to wait for the new 2025 LG TVs to drop to score a great deal on an older generation model. Right now, you can pick up a 202365\" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TVfor just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday.

    "publishedAt": "2025-03-12T12:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-golden-age-the-rise-and-fall-resident-evil-monster-hunter-wilds",
    "full_text": "With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its wayandits audience.\n\nCapcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.\nBut in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.\n2016 was a bad year for Capcom.\nThe big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.\nThis was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.\nAll of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .\nAchieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.\nCapcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4.\n2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema.\nUnfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.\n“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.\nThis directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op.\nThis downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.\nBut it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.\nThis slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.\nIt was clear something needed to change.\nBy the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability.\nWhile neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.\n“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”\nThose constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6.\n\"We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V,\" Nakayama says. \"And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title.\"\nAll this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards.“There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.\n“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”\nThe team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.\nThere was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master.\n“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.”\nStreet Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series.\nWhile they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.\nWhile Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.\nAround the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience.\n“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”\nIf you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.\n“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”\nItsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance.\nNo other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened.\nFirstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.\n“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”\nMonster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.\nThis created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.\nBut the reality was that Monster Hunterdidhave fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.\nReleased in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.\n“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”\nIt was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”\nIt wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world.\n“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”Tsujimoto says.\nOne important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.\nThis explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.\n“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”\nMonster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call.\n“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&D teams were divided into R&D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”\nTakeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.\nThere were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.\n“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.\nThe game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series.\nBut Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time.\n“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.\nThe result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history.\nNaturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?\nAmpo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”\nBut despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.\nAround the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.\n“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.”\nItsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.\nThe 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. \"Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively,\" Itsuno says. \"When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”\nThis vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should.\nAmpo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, \"So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.”\nThis meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.\n“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”\nSince 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.\nFocusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat.\nBut what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.\nMany of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever.\nWhen asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”\nMonster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”\nMatt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor."

    "title": "Why Assassin's Creed 2 and 3 Had the Best Writing the Series Has Ever Seen",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-15T16:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/why-assassins-creed-2-and-3-had-the-best-writing-the-series-has-ever-seen",
    "full_text": "One of the most memorable moments in the entire Assassin’s Creed series happens near the start of Assassin’s Creed 3, when Haytham Kenway has finished rounding up his band of assassins in the New World. Or at least, the player is led to believe they’re assassins. Haytham, after all, uses a hidden blade, is just as charismatic as previous series protagonist Ezio Auditore, and has – up until this point in the campaign – played the part of a hero, busting Native Americans out of prison and beating up cocky British redcoats. Only when he utters the familiar phrase, “May the Father of Understanding guide us,” does it become clear we have actually been following our sworn enemies, the Templars.\n\nTo me, this surprising setup represents the fullest realization of Assassin’s Creed’s potential. The first game in the series introduced an intriguing concept – find, get to know, and kill your targets – but fell short in the story department, with both protagonist Altaïr and his victims being utterly bereft of personality. Assassin’s Creed 2 took a step in the right direction by replacing Altaïr with the more iconic Ezio, but failed to apply the same treatment to his adversaries, with the big bad of its spinoff Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, Cesare Borgia, coming across as particularly underdeveloped. Only in Assassin’s Creed 3, set during the American Revolution, did the developers at Ubisoft devote as much time to fleshing out the hunted as they did the hunter. It lent the game an organic flow from set-up to payoff and, as a result, achieved a delicate balance between gameplay and narrative that as yet hasn’t been replicated since.\nWhile the current RPG era of the series has largely been well received by players and critics, a wealth of articles, YouTube videos, and forum posts agree that Assassin’s Creed is in decline, and has been for some time. What exactly is responsible for this downfall, however, is subject to debate. Some point to the increasingly unrealistic premises of the modern games, which have you face off against gods like Anubis and Fenrir. Others take issue with Ubisoft’s implementation of a varied spectrum of romance options or, in the hotly-disputed case of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, replacing its hitherto fictional protagonists with a real-world historical figure, an African samurai called Yasuke. My personal nostalgia for the Xbox 360/PS3-era games notwithstanding, I’d argue it’s none of these. Instead, such decline is a result of the series’ gradual abandonment of character-driven storytelling, which has by now gotten buried deep inside its sprawling sandbox.\nOver the years, Assassin’s Creed has padded its original action-adventure formula with a slew of RPG and live service-ish elements, from dialogue trees and XP-based levelling systems to loot boxes, microtransaction DLC, and gear customization. But the bigger the new installments have become, the emptier they have started to feel, and not just with regard to the countless climb-this-tower, find-that-object side-missions, but also their basic storytelling.\nAlthough allowing you to choose what your character says or does should theoretically make the overall experience more immersive, in practice I’ve found it often has the opposite effect: as scripts get longer and longer to account for multiple possible scenarios, they feel like they lack the same level of polish as a game with a more limited range of interaction. The focused, screenplay-like scripts of the series’ action-adventure era allowed for sharply defined characters that were not pulled thin by a game structure that demands its protagonist be compassionate or brutal on the whim of the player.\nThus, while a game like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey technically has more content than Assassin’s Creed 2, much of it feels wooden and underbaked. This unfortunately breaks the immersion; it's too often very obvious that you are interacting with computer generated characters rather than complex historical figures. This is in stark contrast to the franchise’s Xbox 360/PS3 era, which in my humble opinion has produced some of the finest writing in all of gaming, from Ezio’s fiery “Do not follow me, or anyone else!” speech after besting Savonarola, to the tragicomic soliloquy Haytham delivers when he is at long last killed by his son, Connor:\n“Don't think I have any intention of caressing your cheek and saying I was wrong. I will not weep and wonder what might have been. I'm sure you understand. Still, I'm proud of you in a way. You have shown great conviction. Strength. Courage. All noble qualities. I should have killed you long ago.”\nThe writing has suffered in other ways over the years, too. Where the modern games tend to stick to the easily digestible dichotomy of Assassins = good and Templars = bad, the earlier games went to great lengths to show that the line between the two orders isn’t as clear-cut as it initially appears. In Assassin’s Creed 3, each defeated Templar uses their last breath to make Connor – and, by extension, the player – question their own beliefs. William Johnson, a negotiator, says the Templars could have stopped the Native American genocide. Thomas Hickey, a hedonist, calls the Assassins’ mission unrealistic and promises Connor that he’ll never feel fulfilled. Benjamin Church, who betrays Haytham, declares it’s “all a matter of perspective,” and that the British – from their point of view – see themselves as the victims, not the aggressors.\nHaytham, for his part, tries to shake Connor’s faith in George Washington, claiming the country he’ll create will be no less despotic than the monarchy from which the Americans sought to liberate themselves – an assertion which rings all the more true when we discover that the command to burn down Connor’s village wasn’t given by Haytham’s henchman Charles Lee, as previously thought, but Washington. By the end of the game, the player has more questions than answers – and the story is stronger for it.\nLooking back on the franchise’s long history, there is a reason why one track from the Jesper Kyd-composed Assassin’s Creed 2 score, “Ezio’s Family,” resonated with players to the point of becoming the series’ official theme. The PS3 games, particularly Assassin’s Creed 2 and Assassin’s Creed 3, were – at their core – character-driven experiences; the melancholic guitar strings of “Ezio’s Family” weren’t meant to evoke the game’s Renaissance setting so much as Ezio’s personal trauma of losing his family. As much as I admire the expansive worldbuilding and graphical fidelity of the current generation of Assassin’s Creed games, my hope is that this out-of-control franchise will someday scale itself down, and once again deliver the kind of focused, tailor-made stories that made me fall in love with it in the first place. Sadly, in a landscape dominated by sprawling sandboxes and single-player games with live service-style ambitions, I fear that’s just not “good business” anymore.\nTim Brinkhof is a freelance writer specializing in art and history.

    "full_text": "Gaming hardware company ASUS has pulled back the curtain at what may be the reported Xbox-branded handheld device.\n\nThe ASUS Republic of Gamers X/Twitter account shared ateasershowing its \"little robot friend cooking something up,\" offering a brief glimpse at both a Republic of Gamers (ROG) Xbox controller and handheld system.\nLast month, IGN reported on Microsoft’s video game hardware ambition, which allegedly includes a full next-gen Xbox for 2027 and anXbox-branded gaming handheld that may launch later in 2025.\nThat's not our only clue, either. The handheld shown in ASUS's teaser clearly shows off buttons configured for Xbox (Y, B, A, and X, rather than PlayStation's triangle, circle, cross, and square, or Nintendo's X, A, B, and Y). There's also a D-pad, two thumbsticks, and four smaller additional buttons, although it's pretty hard to make those out clearly.\nPerhaps most interestingly of all, though, the official Xbox accountacknowledged the tweetwith a cheeky wide-eyed gif, suggesting this is all setting up a reveal.\npic.twitter.com/ONZpeEmNka\nUnfortunately, that's all we have. There's no date on the reveal yet, let alone a concrete launch window, but the monitor the little robot is working on states \"Marathon stamina, more capacity, faster speeds\" and \"fresh look!\" giving us an idea of what the handheld's unique selling points may be.\nIn January, Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s VP of ‘Next Generation,’ toldThe Vergethat the company plans to combine Xbox and Windows experiences together for PC gaming handhelds made by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), otherwise known as third-party hardware manufacturers. Existing PC gaming OEMs include ASUS, Lenovo, and Razer.\nWhile this Xbox-branded gaming handheld is not a Microsoft-made console, the company is reportedly planning to finally launch one of its own in 2027, potentially alongside its next-gen Xbox.Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer recently indicated a first-party Xbox handheld is years away.\nSpeaking of which, the successor to the Xbox Series X is now allegedly \"fully\" in production and due out in two years, tying in with Xbox president Sarah Bond's recent comments thatMicrosoft was \"moving full speed ahead on our next generation hardware, focused on delivering the biggest technological leap ever in a generation.\"\nFor some time now, there's been much speculation around the future of consoles, with Netflix's President of Games, Alain Tascan, recently stating that he expectsa future generation that relies less on gaming consolesdespite major players like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo pushing forward with new hardware. The latter'shighly anticipated Switch 2 devicewill be showcased in a Nintendo Direct on April 2, with many fans expecting to hear more aboutwhat features the Switch 2 brings to the table, its release date, andhow pre-orders will be managed.\nVikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

Over the years, the Apple-owned platform has grown into a powerhouse of original TV shows, likeTed LassoandSeverance, as well as movies likeKillers of the Flower Moon.

Apple TV+ was also thefirst streaming service to receive an Academy Award for its original film CODA, which released in 2022.\nWhile Apple TV+ may not boast a massive library like Netflix, it's long maintained a \"quality over quantity\" approach when it comes to its original programming with something that will surely appeal to just about anyone, regardless of age.\nApple TV+ is one of the least-expensive streaming services at $9.99/month.Since there's no ads by default, there's no ad-supported or limited tiers to worry about.\nAside from standalone subscriptions, Apple TV+ is included in a bundled service calledApple One.

Developed by NeoBards, set in a mountain town in 1960s Japan, and written by Higurashi and Umineko author Ryukishi07, Silent Hill f looks to be an interesting new venture for the horror series.\nThe broadcast didn't include much in the way of gameplay though. In lieu of that, fans have been poring over the content warnings and ESRB rating for Silent Hill f, both of which are live and provide some surprisingly detailed descriptions of what terrors wait in the town of Ebisugaoka.\nOver on the ESRB site, Silent Hill f garnered a Mature 17+ rating for \"Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Partial Nudity.\" None of that by itself is terribly surprising, but it's the rating summary that offers some more detail:\nFaces ripped apart, hot irons, and a character sawing off their arm certainly paint a gruesome picture. Silent Hill f could get pretty gnarly, even by Silent Hill's standards. It is, after all,the first game in the series to earn a CERO:Z in Japan, an 18+ rating; the others have typically garnered CERO:C or CERO:D, which are 15+ and 17+, respectively.\nSilent Hill f may also be dealing with some heavy topics and imagery too. For that, we can look at the game's content warning, displayed on boththe official siteand theSteam store page:\nBetween the actual physical horror and tackling these kinds of themes, Silent Hill f certainly seems like it's engaging with the kind of material you'd expect in a Silent Hill. For horror fans, that's hopefully a good sign.\nSilent Hill f has no release date at the moment, though having an ESRB rating this detailed certainly suggests it's not far off.

The LG Evo C-series of TVs have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVs, especially for 4K HDR movies and gaming.\n\nThe LG Evo C3 is a 2023 model, just one year behind the 2024 LG Evo C4. So what are the differences? Aside from the $650 price difference, not much. The most important trait -- picture quality -- is more or less identical. Where the C4 improves on the C3 are an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate.\nOLED TVs are considered the best TVs you can buy right now. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, they offer better image quality, deeper blacks, better contrast ratio, wider color gamut, and super fast response times. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV are easily the best type of TV for viewing 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations.\nThe LG C3 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel and all four HDMI 2.1 ports for running 4K at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. It also supports variable refresh rate (VRR), auto low latency mode (ALLM), and DTS audio, which is good for people who still watch Blu-ray discs. The C3 is also much easier to set up than its predecessors; the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that drops the weight to a mere 36 pounds.\nThe LG Evo C-series TV is ourfavorite high-end 4K TV of 2025because of the brilliance of its OLED display along with a host of quality features that don't quite push it to the point of an excessively high price. This model brings better contrast and clarity than the previous year's already luminous LG C2. It’s a sight to behold, especially when you add in the deep blacks and well-balanced colors on the crisp 4K screen. Once you choose OLED, it's hard to go back to anything else.\nThe LG Evo C5 hasn't yet been released, butit was showcased during CES 2025. At least on paper, the improvements of the C5 seem to be incremental, with no major ground breaking updates that would make you want to hold off until its launch.

LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations.\nThe LG C4 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz and all four HDMI ports are 2.1 spec for running games in 4K at up to 120fps on a PS5 or Xbox Series X without any tearing. The C4 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM). The C4 is also easier to install than its predecessors; the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that weighs 36 pounds.\nThe LG Evo C-series TV is ourfavorite high-end 4K TV of 2025because of the brilliance of its OLED display along with a host of quality features that don't quite push it to the point of an excessively high price. This model brings better contrast and clarity than the previous year's already luminous LG C2. It’s a sight to behold, especially when you add in the deep blacks and well-balanced colors on the crisp 4K screen. Once you choose OLED, it's hard to go back to anything else.\nIf you bought a brand new TV over the holidays and you're looking for a good audio solution at an excellent price, then one of the best Black Friday deals is back. Walmart is currently offering theBose Smart Soundbar 550for just $199 with free shipping after a massive $300 off instant discount. At this price, it's certainly one of the best soundbars you can get, especially if you're looking for an affordable soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos.\nIf you don't mind going a generation back, you can pick up a 202365\" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TVfor just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday. The 2024 C4 has minimal incremental upgrades over the 2023 C3, with the most noticeable improvements being an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, support for DTS audio, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate.\nIf you prefer Sony as your TV brand, then Best Buy has some great deals for this week. The Sony Bravia XR A75L 4K OLED smart TVs are on sale right now with the 55\" model priced at $999.99 and the 65\" model for $1,299.99. Although the A75L is an older generation (2023) TV, it's still one of the best TVs out there in terms of image quality and gaming performance. Especially for the 55\" model, you won't find a better TV for under $1,000.\nLooking for more options?

Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success,signing a deal with Sonyto form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP, and launching the game on PS5.\nLooming over all this isa lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, who seek \"an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages\" on the grounds that Palworld has allegedly infringed on \"multiple\" patent rights.Pocketpair has provided an update, identifying the patents the studio is allegedly infringing, and it has since tweaked how players summon Pals in Palworld, apparently in response.

    "full_text": "Don’t hold your breath forThe Witcher 4. According to the developers at CD Projekt, it won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest.\n\nSpeaking in afinancial calloutlining projections of future profits, CD Projekt said: “Even though we do not plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026, we are still driven by this financial goal. And although it’s very ambitious, we stand a chance of achieving it within the given timeframe.”\nThat rules out a launch this year, which no-one really expected, a launch next year, which some had hoped for, and sets 2027 as the earliest The Witcher 4 will come out. But that’s if everything goes to plan, and as we all know, the video game industry has a hard time with its plans. Could The Witcher 4 end up being a 2028 game? It sounds possible.\nEither way, 2027 at the earliest suggests The Witcher 4 may well end up targeting the next-generation of consoles, with Sony no-doubt working on its PlayStation 6 plans as we speak, andMicrosoft rumored to be targeting a 2027 release for its Xbox Series X successor and an Xbox handheld. But is it a cross-gen game, as Cyberpunk 2077 was when it released in December 2020?\nIf it is a cross-gen game, with a version for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, could The Witcher 4 end up working on Nintendo Switch 2? It seems unlikely at face value, but The Witcher 3 ended up on the Switch, so miracles do happen.\nHere's what we know: The Witcher 4 is the first in a new trilogy of Witcher games set after the events of The Witcher 3. But rather than star Geralt as protagonist, Ciri is the main character this time around.\nSpeaking exclusively to IGN ahead of The Witcher 4 reveal, executive producer Małgorzata Mitręga said Ciri was “the very organic, logical choice.”\n“It was always about her, starting from Saga when you read it in the books. She's an amazing, layered character. And of course, as a protagonist we said goodbye to Geralt previously. So this is a continuation. I guess for all of us it’s like she was meant to be. That was always her.”\nIn January, speaking to IGN as part of a wider interview on Netflix’s upcoming animated film,The Witcher: Sirens of The Deep,Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle backed CD Projekt’s decision, even though it sees Geralt take a back seat.\n“I'm really excited,” he said. “I think it's a really good move. I mean, I always thought that continuing the Saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons, but mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because people, I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done.”\nAnd in February,the director ofThe Witcher 4clarified that a new video featured the same in-game model of Ciri after some had thought her face looked different.\nWe’ve got plenty more exclusive content on The Witcher 4, includinga trailer breakdownand an interview with CD Projekt where the developer explainswhy The Witcher 4 will avoid a Cyberpunk 2077-style launch disaster.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "title": "10 Ways Switch 2 Is Better than Switch",
    "publishedAt": "2025-04-05T14:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/10-ways-switch-2-is-better-than-switch",
    "full_text": "Rejoice, fellow Nintendo fans. On Wednesday, the clouds parted, the sun rose, and the divine spectra; hand of Miyamoto reached down from the sky to grace us with Nintendo’s newest handheld carnival of joy, the Switch 2. After years of speculation, we finally have a clear look at the mysterious console hybrid.\n\nSadly, while sleek, compact, and powerful, the rumours are untrue. The Switch 2 does not in fact pack a tiny little Reggie into every GPU. But after we spent an hour during the Direct glued to every word: dissecting it, screenshotting every image, poring over captured video for tiny clues to its form and function, we can finally apply something besides guesswork and give you some solid facts, including all the ways it leaves its beloved predecessor in the dust.\nThis is probably the least-surprising revelation as practically every next-gen Nintendo console has been significantly improved over its predecessor (yes, even the Wii). Still, when released in 2017, Switch was hardly a cutting-edge powerhouse in comparison to Sony and Xbox consoles, and eight years later it noticeably struggles under demanding games. Nintendo and its partners were increasingly running up against the limitations of the hardware.\nThis week we saw elements on display promising us a vastly improved experience: handheld resolutions up to 1080p, docked up to 4K, both with HDR, and framerates extending up to 120 fps. It’s a welcome upgrade that should allow a wider variety of games to come to Switch 2. We may already see some of the fruit in EA’s decision to host soccer and football games on Switch 2, and 2K’s intention to do the same with wrestling and basketball.\nThird parties revealed all manner of current-gen games to give us some idea of the Switch 2’s increased capabilities, and what we saw was encouraging: a console/handheld capable of handling Elden Ring, Street Fighter 6, and other demanding software. And what Nintendo showed of their new first-party offerings was simply gorgeous.\nThe little purple lunchbox that could finally comes to Nintendo Switch Online, exclusively available on Switch 2. Nintendo has effectively drawn a fence between online experiences on Switch and Switch 2, and that means that from this point forward those who want to play some of Nintendo’s best retro games are going to have to shell out for better hardware. Sure, it’s only three games right now, but those three games are absolute bangers: The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and, holy crap, Soul Calibur 2, complete with Link.\nOkay, seriously. Soul Calibur 2 is incredible. If you’ve never played it with a friend you are in for such a treat.\nWhen humanity later reviews and catalogues the glorious day in video game history, the opening chapter won’t be about how Mario Kart is now like Forza Horizon, or about Donkey Kong’s return in Bananza, or even about the announcement of the until-now secret project called Duskblood. Instead, the book will open and perhaps also close with the most significantly un-Nintendo thing to happen this week: easy integration of online features commonly available on other platforms.\nThe company that brought us Friend Codes now graces us with GameChat, a feature-rich communication and visual sharing feature set for Switch 2. A noise-cancelling mic picks up your voice and shares it with friends. An optional desktop camera allows you to share your face, both in window-corners and in compatible games like Mario Party. You can also share screens across consoles remotely. It’s much of what we gave up on asking Nintendo for years ago... a simple, straightforward tool for playing with friends. I’m looking forward to seeing how it actually plays out.\nSo much potential awaits with this feature. Where my mind keeps going is Monster Hunter, with teams of four benefitting from shared screens as they pursue and trap their prey. It’s simply become unthinkable for Nintendo to voluntarily offer fans such a useful array of online features, but here we are living in the future at last.\nOkay, we’d already guessed this but it’s still really cool. Joy-Cons now magnetically snap to the Switch 2 body rather than slotting in. Nintendo showed off how the steel shoulder buttons on each controller attract to the magnetic facing along the sides of the screen, locking them together. A press of a button releases the magnetic grip.\nThis is a pretty great feature for my home setup, where a shelf top obstructs removing the Joy-Cons without removing the entire Switch from the dock, which sometimes leads to knocking the whole thing down. I’m a fan.\nBigger isn’t always better with handhelds, but given the sharper resolution of the 1080p portable screen and the nature of most Switch games, the slight increase in size to 7.9 inches should be a net gain for most players. The first Switch sacrificed screen real estate for portability but I think Nintendo is making the right call in giving these elaborate, feature -rich games more space to shine.\nNintendo was weirdly excited to show off its innovative Joy-Con mouse features. A Switch 2 Joy-Con laid on its side can be scooted across a tabletop, and its telemetry tracked to provide precise pointing and rotation. It looks to be heavily-supported at launch by games like Drag x Drive, Civ 7, and Metroid Prime 4.\nI do love wacky Nintendo. My guess is the mouse feature won’t see much use past launch window (much like the microphone on the old DS) but I’m actually 1000% in on playing Metroid Prime 4 with a mouse. As a PC gamer, I rarely enjoy FPS games that force me to use a controller, so this surprising option feels a bit liberating. Hopefully we get Mario Paint 2.\nThis one is more of a double-edged sword. Nintendo crammed the Switch 2 with 256GB of external storage, much more than the original Switch. But with all the Switch 2’s extra graphics capacity, those asset-rich game files are going to be much bigger too, so it may be close to a wash. The memory is quicker as well to deal with larger game files, which means you’ll need a new, faster memory card for your supplemental storage.\nNintendo tweaked the Switch hardware in response to nearly a decade of feedback. Switch 2 now features two USB-C ports, with one added on top to assist in charging while playing in kickstand mode. Nintendo added a fan to the doc to aid in cooling consistency. Sticks are larger and sound capabilities are improved.\nEven the Switch 2 Pro Controller is a step up, with an audio jack (at last!) and assignable buttons. No telling yet if the new controller contains the same miniaturized star that exists at the core of every Switch Pro Controller, giving it near-unlimited battery life.\nAnd one of the most subtle features might be most useful. I do a fair bit of Switch playing on my tabletop. The fact that the Switch 2 screen angle is adjustable in kickstand mode is a huge deal for me. Too often, ambient light at an airport or the angle of a tight airplane tray table make playing in kickstand seem like an exercise in futility. But with the ability to subtly shift angles, coupled with the new mouse feature, leads me to believe I might actually be able to enjoy a serious game of Civilization 7 on the go.\nSo first off, Switch 2 is backward compatible. That’s always good. Microsoft has already blazed a pretty amazing trail toward optimized backward compatibility on Xbox, and Nintendo has also wisely taken a note from its own Gamecube to Wii to WiiU history, making most Switch games a snap to play on new hardware. Backward capacity helps sell consoles their first year.\nWhile the Nintendo Switch 2 is backward compatible with Switch games, it also supports special new Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of certain Switch titles like Metroid Prime 4. These enhanced titles offer new features including a selection between a higher-res Quality Mode or a faster frame rate in Performance Mode.\nOne really cool feature of these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions is that if you already own the original game on Switch, you will be able to purchase a simple Switch 2 Edition upgrade and enjoy all the new features on your new hardware.  Let's hope it's not too expensive.\nIt’s also possible that Switch 2 Editions of Switch’s notoriously-janky Pokemon games could be improved by these features. Let's hope so. Throwing hardware at things can’t solve every problem but sometimes it really helps.\nMario Kart World does everything we expect of Mario Kart and adds two key elements. The first is the ability to traverse a continuous world Forza Horizon-style, racing from course to course, free mode exploring, fooling around, and so on. The second is the swelling of the field size to 24 carts, which is, well, a lot to get one’s head around when the shells start flying. It sounds like absolute bedlam. I can’t wait.\nNintendo took its time showing off new games but toward the end of the show we bought about a minute tease of a new Kirby’s Air Ride game, Kirby’s Air Riders, an announcement that would likely have resulted in a thunderous snooze were it not for the surprising involvement of one Mr. Sakurai, known equally for his self-immolating work ethic and his status as god of Smash Bros. I love Kirby, but Air Ride sucked... BUT it’s Sakurai so I’m now 100% in.\nThen there was The Duskbloods, a trailer that produced some hysterics in me. At first I thought it was Bloodborne 2, then I thought it was a licensed FROM Software take on Castlevania, and then finally I accepted that what I was seeing was an entirely original Miyazaki game exclusive to Switch. My friends, remember: FROM Software does not miss. Probably you will die. Probably you will dodge roll. Certainly you will have a blast.\nAnd of course; the real King of Kong makes his triumphant return to 3D with Donkey Kong Bananza. It’s a moment of absolution for Nintendo: 26 years after dropping the barbequed turd Donkey Kong 64 on an unsuspecting planet, a wiser, more skilled Nintendo has returned to the drawing board with what’s sure to be a landmark adventure.\nNintendo devs have been absolutely murdering 3D platforming on the Switch, not just with Odyssey and Bowser’s Fury, but also with Kirby’s incredible journey to the shores of the Forgotten Lands. Bananza was constructed to showcase far more capable hardware than these modern-day classics, which means that the devs had opportunities to iterate on ideas that wouldn’t have been possible on a basic Switch.\nJared Petty is a former IGN editor who likes writing about how wonderful and silly video games are.

    "full_text": "Um dos gêneros mais populares e importantes dos videogames na última década foi o soulslike. Encabeçado pela FromSoftware e títulos como Dark Souls, Bloodborne e, mais recentemente, Elden Ring, essa categoria derivada dos RPGs de ação reverbera sucessos há 10 anos. Para embarcar nessa onda, a desenvolvedora Neople e a publicadora Nexon criaram The First Berserker: Khazan, novo soulslike baseado no universo do aqui no Brasil quase desconhecido Dungeon Fighter Online, que deixa as raízes de Dark Souls de lado para se inspirar em Nioh e nos soulslikes da Team Ninja.\nDurante as minhas mais de 35 horas de jogo, pude encontrar muitas qualidades no combate e construção de builds baseadas nos inúmeros itens que podemos combinar, mas me senti extremamente entediado com um level design fraco, uma repetição de inimigos no mínimo esquisita e personagens desinteressantes. The First Berserker: Khazan é um jogo muito intenso para o bem e para o mal, mas consegue demonstrar proeminência naquilo que se propõe a ser: um soulslike desafiador.\nCom uma narrativa um tanto quanto comum em histórias de brucutus em busca de vingança, o jogo segue esse mesmo caminho e nos apresenta Khazan, um poderoso general do império de Pell Los, que é condenado injustamente e exilado para montanhas nevadas por traição ao imperador. No entanto, o acaso do destino faz com que ele seja “salvo” por um espírito maligno que o possui e assim começa uma longa jornada de vingança. A premissa é bastante básica, mas a extensão do universo faz com que a narrativa ganhe camadas de profundidade, embora nenhuma delas consiga tornar o enredo cativante de verdade.\nMesmo com reviravoltas mirabolantes, a trama de traição se mantém clichê do início ao fim e em diversos momentos é sonolenta. Os personagens de suporte também são imemoráveis e apenas uma se destacou para mim entre aliados e inimigos: Elamein. Apesar de o vilão ser bom, ele não sustenta a trama fraca. A história é definitivamente o ponto mais baixo do jogo, mas que não pesa tanto graças ao combate sólido e eficiente – pelo menos na maioria das vezes.\nO ponto de maior destaque e brilho de The First Berserker: Khazan é, sem dúvidas, o combate. Extremamente fluido, veloz, intenso, cheio de variedade de armas e habilidades. O game é um soulslike bastante voltado para o parry, mas não de uma forma semelhante a Sekiro. Aqui, a ausência de escudo obriga você a dominar a habilidade de aparar ataques e de desviar no momento certo, porém a esquiva é curta e muitas vezes é a pior opção para escapar de ataques.\nQuando partirmos para o ataque, no entanto, vemos aqui onde a equipe da Neople depositou grande parte dos esforços. Khazan é como uma mistura de Kratos, o Chosen One de Dark Souls e o Lobo de Sekiro — tudo isso parece confuso, mas quando o controlamos as coisas se alinham. O jogo apresenta três opções de arma: lanças, empunhadura dupla com espada e machado e, por fim, a espada de duas mãos. Na minha gameplay, optei pela lança na maior parte do tempo, afinal, o dano me pareceu mais equilibrado e a velocidade de ataque me satisfez mais.\nO crescimento da jogabilidade é exponencial: no começo temos combos simples e ataques com dardo — semelhante ao arco e flecha. No entanto, conforme aprofundamos a vasta árvore de habilidades de Khazan, as lutas se tornam mais fluidas, sangrentas e polidas de certa forma. Mesmo assim, não pude deixar de observar que em algumas situações a hitbox me pareceu meio confusa e até mesmo problemática, tanto para inimigos quanto para armadilhas do cenário, mas foram casos bem específicos e que não se repetiram.\nOs combos de lança são dinâmicos e se encaixaram perfeitamente na minha gameplay. Consegui acabar com inimigos rapidamente, mas precisamos falar sobre o equilíbrio de dificuldade muito peculiar que o jogo apresenta.\nQuanto às batalhas de chefe, algumas são básicas, desde a música e movimentos do inimigo até as arenas, enquanto outras mostram o potencial do jogo e exigem o uso máximo das mecânicas de The First Berserker. Na minha experiência pessoal, nenhuma delas merece grande destaque, exceto a batalha final que é digna de um grande RPG de ação pela magnitude do combate.\nUm grande destaque do jogo é a criação de builds que se baseia muito nos sistemas de Nioh. É possível ter muito controle dos status do personagem e adaptar Khazan para a sua arma e jogabilidade. Itens do mesmo set concedem bônus conforme você equipá-los e acumular status.\nO único sistema ruim de combate é o de invocações, que não ajudam em nada durante as batalhas de chefe e muitas vezes apenas atrapalham. No entanto, os fantasmas são um bom suporte em lutas rotineiras.\nObviamente, por ser um soulslike, The First Berserker: Khazan possui uma dificuldade acentuada, mas os picos de complexidade em progredir no jogo são… esquisitos. Alguns chefes e mapas iniciais são muito difíceis, enquanto algumas batalhas intermediárias contra inimigos de elite e até mesmo os chefões não apresentam desafio, e, por fim, as batalhas mais avançadas são surpreendentemente fáceis. Isso seria normal caso esses picos de dificuldade fossem parte da progressão que, obviamente, fica menos complexa conforme o avançar do jogo, mas The First Berserker tem uma inconsistência de dificuldade que, a meu ver, mostra uma falha de balanceamento no jogo que empobrece a experiência.\nUm dos maiores destaques da FromSoftware em Dark Souls é o mapa minuciosamente conectado que possui atalhos e conexões que exploram a sagacidade dos designers em produzir essas fases. Infelizmente, por optar em se inspirar na Team Ninja e jogos como Nioh e Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, o level design de The First Berserker: Khazan se perde em diversos momentos.\nApesar de contar com áreas vastas e alguns atalhos, muitas regiões do mapa parecem sem vida ou possuem conexões um tanto quanto sem sentido que seriam melhores apenas colocando outra espada da fenda, a “bonfire” do game, para tornar a ligação entre áreas dos biomas mais inteligentes. O jogo poderia olhar mais para Lies of P e criar um level design muito melhor, mas se inspirou justamente em soulslikes com design de mapa problemáticos.\nA má qualidade do level design se alinha à repetitividade de inimigos, aspecto ainda mais evidente quando olhamos para as missões secundárias, que reutilizam esses cenários com pequenas mudanças e tornam o jogo cansativo ao longo do tempo.\nThe First Berserker: Khazan é intenso para o bem e para o mal. Quando o jogo está imerso em seu combate, criação de builds e algumas batalhas de chefe, ele brilha e muito, quase alcançando a prateleira dos ótimos soulslikes. Contudo, o level design ruim, repetição de inimigos, história sonolenta e dificuldade inconsistente fazem ele cair de patamar e ser só mais um soulslike, embora ainda figure entre os bons títulos do gênero, não mais do que isso. Os amantes de Nioh e de jogatinas difíceis encontrarão muita diversão em mais de 35 horas de campanha."

    "title": "South of Midnight Review",
    "publishedAt": "2025-04-03T16:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-review",
    "full_text": "In an early chapter of South of Midnight, our protagonist Hazel is coming to grips with her newfound powers - it’s an important tone-setter, because it’s representative of what developer Compulsion Games is trying to do throughout a concise 12-hour runtime. Mythical creatures straight out of folklore from the American South drive a human story that stands as a fantastic example of how the local can be universal, with the grand tapestry of that region's culture and history wrapped around an otherwise fairly straightforward action-adventure game. While there are plenty of aspects of South of Midnight that aren’t necessarily groundbreaking, it’s all uplifted by a clear and well-executed artistic vision that makes it one the more memorable Xbox console exclusives of this generation.\n\nHazel’s ability to manipulate the magical threads of an ethereal realm is both the weapon she uses to defeat otherworldly demons in combat and the tool she relies on to piece together the tragic pasts of her neighbors and forebears in her hometown of Prospero. It’s a fictional place, but one that’s deeply rooted in the very real experience of the South – traces of its dark history litter the dilapidated houses after a treacherous flood, contrasting with the remnants of communities that struggled to survive in those harsh conditions. These touches provide the rich context South of Midnight is working within while also unraveling a larger story about the pain, guilt, and trauma many of us experience in our own family lives.\nFrom a gameplay perspective, South of Midnight is rather simple – you’re ushered through fairly linear levels that alternate between platforming and combat encounters, with a few secrets hidden off the beaten path like journal entries from the locals that enrich the story and extra upgrades for your powers and health. If you’ve scaled cliffsides in Uncharted, God of War, or Tomb Raider, its frequent climbing sections will feel pretty familiar – but with the authentic sights and sounds of the American South at the forefront, the detailed vistas, ramshackled towns, or rushing rivers create a strong sense of place. With Hazel’s weaving powers, you’ll zip through air, clear paths forward, or summon ethereal objects depending on what obstacles are in front of you. There isn’t really much tofigure outper se, although there is an enjoyable momentum as you’re funneled from one fight to the next, or when you’re trying to outrun evil spirits chasing you down in the lengthy platforming sequences that cap off every major chapter.\nCombat itself is contained in distinct arenas across each level, with the idea being that Haints – the demonic manifestations of peoples’ pain and sorrow – plague all of Prospero, and Hazel is the one who can cleanse that corruption. It’s a comfortable, if predictable, cadence that doesn’t really wear thin since it’s judicious about when you actually have to fight. This helps South of Midnight not feel repetitive, and I genuinely looked forward to each combat encounter. Similar to the platforming, these fights aren’t really pushing any boundaries, but Hazel's attack combos and spells have a certain chunkiness that I really enjoyed. That’s especially true when firing off her stun weaves and grappling strand to stack damage, then leaving a burst behind with a perfect dodge. Cycling through a shortlist of fun abilities like that makes the basics satisfying.\nHaints come in various forms that give encounters enough variety. Some are swift and pesky, while others are hulking beasts that tunnel underground and cause massive area-of-effect damage. They’re mixed and matched throughout, and things like Hazel’s puppet named Crouton, who can temporarily control enemies, add an interesting wrinkle when thinking about which targets to prioritize. There are a few boss fights to heighten the stakes with a bit of spectacle as well, but they mostly tend to highlight the formulaic nature of combat by relying on derivative versions of mechanics that are used elsewhere.\nSouth of Midnight’s foundation is perfectly competent, but it’s everything else around it that makes it truly stand out, grabbing you with its painterly character designs and striking stop-motion animation style. That unconventional choice helps special moments pop during cutscenes, although it isn’t really noticeable in the action – and if you find it too jarring, you can optionally disable the stop-motion effect altogether. Even without it, the details in characters’ faces, their expressiveness, and the superb voice acting feel like the real reward chapter after chapter. The specific accents and vernacular come across authentically, to the point where I didn’t think twice about them since it all sounded so familiar to me as someone who was born in the region.\nSouthern gothic folklore hasn’t really been explored in games like this, and South of Midnight showcases how rich it is by bringing these tales to life in ways we rarely see. Mythical creatures embody the pain and suffering of townsfolk, melding broader urban myths with the struggles of specific characters throughout the story. A figure like Florida’s legendary alligator Two-Toed Tom shows up as a boss, while the shapeshifting Rougarou from Cajun tales takes a form I hadn’t heard of before – and Alabama’s Huggin’ Molly has on a fascinating reinterpretation. It’s the sort of amalgamation of folklore that’s wonderful to see as someone who is familiar with some of it, but done in a way that’s still inviting for the uninitiated.\nSouth of Midnight acknowledges the region’s real history in subtle and effective ways as well, recognizing that remnants of slavery and the Reconstruction era persist in our modern world, and that trauma can carry across generations. Passing by abandoned houses along the bayou with eviction notices from greedy landgrabbers reminds you of the rough and unfair economic conditions many of these communities face. It’s woven into its main themes about the complicated dynamics of family – the best and worst parts that can come from blood relations. With her weaving powers, Hazel can peer into the past through visions recreated using the threads that make up The Grand Tapestry – the flow of all life and memory. You’ll see a mother risking life and limb to escape abuse and give their child a fighting chance; A man ashamed of his brother who takes drastic measures to separate himself, only to live with regret forever; A kid who called out to a mythical creature in desperation to escape his abusive father.\nFrom tragic displays of unconditional love to the horrors of the abuse our own kin can inflict on us, South of Midnight focuses on the idea of family being something we either embrace or reckon with, told in a way that’s inseparable from its setting. Through it all, Hazel is desperately chasing any possible thread to find her mother after that devastating flood at the start, but is still willing to lend a helping hand to the spirits that have endured in the afterlife. As you uncover the hard work her mom puts in as a social worker, it shows that a little empathy can go a long way.\nThere’s a lot I love about the stories in South of Midnight – I do wish they were more elegant or told with more finesse, however. The larger plot is missing some necessary connective tissue at times, and it’s easy to lose track of why Hazel’s journey leads from one thing to another. Characters and narrative threads are sometimes introduced as quickly as they’re resolved through story beats that feel segmented in ways that aren’t entirely clear. There are parts of Hazel’s life I’m still wondering about that get brought up as important pieces to the story, and I wish I could have tied those loose ends together before the credits rolled.\nIt gets the big picture right, though, and in its exploration of a region as wide-ranging as the American South, there’s an earnest interpretation. While it is also a heavily religious place, the story is more interested in the spirituality that gives rise to these folktales. And it’s not all swamps and basins out there, it’s not just Bourbon street in New Orleans, or a politically hostile place for marginalized folks – those are all part of it, for sure. But I like that we have a story that shows thatpeople live there, and they struggle in ways that are both universal and unique to the region. South of Midnight also understands thathurt people hurt people, and knows it’s not an excuse for the terrible things that pain may drive people to do – it’s a bit of a trope when stories talk about mental health nowadays, but there’s still truth to it, and South of Midnight has its own take by focusing on this concept with regards to family.\nPerhaps my favorite touch, however, is how South of Midnight uses its fantastic soundtrack to tie everything together thematically. With a mix of bluegrass, blues, jazz, and American folk tunes that weave in harmonizing choirs, church organs, or banjos and fiddles, it’s a showcase of how important music has been throughout the region’s history. Big story moments are built up through songs written as if a narrator was walking you through what the characters felt and experienced in their life, and they’re queued up at just the right time to propel you forward as you’re playing. It got me in my feelings at times, because there’s not much I love more than a fantastic soundtrack used as an effective storytelling device.\nMany of us from the South have a complicated relationship with it. Born in Mississippi and adopting parts of the culture and vernacular as my family and I moved throughout the country, it’ll always have a special place in my heart. I appreciate having a game that helped me reconnect with those roots in a way that was whimsical and harrowing in equal measure, and that’s the sort of value South of Midnight has beyond just being a good action-adventure game – it’s worth playing for a little virtual tour of the South you wouldn’t see otherwise.\nSouth of Midnight is a straightforward but well-executed action-adventure game on the surface, with a simple but satisfying mix of combat and platforming. It’s focused, filling out its 12-hour runtime nicely without ever dragging or relying on unnecessary padding. Beyond those basics, however, is a certain heart and artistry that elevates the whole package, inviting you to peer into the deep American South through its folklore, nature, and culture. It might not be the most profound exploration of family life, but it’s delivered in ways that feel authentic. From its striking art style to the evocative tunes that bring big story moments together, Hazel’s journey is a captivating one no matter where you come from."

    "title": "The NYXI Hyperion 2 Might Be the Best Switch Joy-Con Alternative",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-07T22:23:33Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/nyxi-hyperion-2-nintendo-switch-joypad-review",
    "full_text": "With the Nintendo Switch 2 on the horizon and presumably launching sometime in the Summer,  perhaps it’s a little too late for even one ofthe best Switch controllersandJoy-Con alternativesto hit the market. But I suppose it’s better late than never. The NYXI Hyperion 2 is a vast improvement over the original Switch's stock Joy-Con with smooth Hall Effect analog sticks, clicky buttons, and ergonomic grips. And since the Hyperion 2 can be used while detached from the Switch, it’s even good enough to recommend in place of a Pro controller (although it does not come with a snap-grip). So, if you’re looking to stay with the original Switch for the foreseeable future and are still looking for a Joy-Con upgrade to improve the handheld experience, this is what you want.\n\nComing for the first Hyperion, the Hyperion 2 sports a much more sensible design – while it’s a bit wider than the normal Joy-Con, it doesn’t have a weird grip style that juts out horizontally. The Hyperion 2 retains a symmetrical shape and looks like it belongs on a Switch. A major perk is the ergonomic grip that fills my hands akin to a Steam Deck, riding the line between being substantial and not being too bulky. There’s a textured surface on each handle that also helps your grip stay secure. This feels like a proper controller to hold and remains relatively lightweight at just 80g each (normal Joy-Cons weigh in around 50g each).\nThe buttons might take a moment to get used to since they work quite differently from the standard Joy-Con. Both the directional pad and face buttons have a clicky mouse-like actuation. What you get in return is a softer and more responsive button-press that’s lighter on the thumbs – they’re also bigger to make them even easier to use. My only gripe is that they have a little too much wiggle room since they’re not tightly locked in place and don’t feel as stable as they should be.\nThat mouse-click design extends to the shoulder bumpers (L and R) and triggers (ZL and ZR). Since the Switch doesn’t have analog triggers, the Hyperion 2 is able to have hair triggers without losing functionality. They sport a very short travel distance and are quick to hit while being light to the touch. The bumpers are easy to hit as well and all it takes is a tap to actuation, and it’s responsive enough to press on the side of the bumper as well.\nThe biggest improvement, however, is in the analog sticks. Not only does the magnetic Hall Effect design solve the issue of stick drift (which has plagued many Switch owners), these are full-fledged analog sticks that rival that of other consoles. You get a full range of motion and a consistent resistance throughout that range – while it’s just a tad stiff to get off the deadzone, they remain smooth to the touch for precise movements.\nMost aftermarket controllers nowadays have back buttons, including the Hyperion 2 – you get two programmable buttons (one on each grip) that sits along your middle finger. NYXI struck a good balance between being easy enough to press without too much effort and not being so light that you'd accidentally hit them (unless you’re gripping your Switch like your life depends on it.) However, a knock against them here is that you need to download a mobile app called KeyLinker to program opposite-side inputs to a back button. It’s a woefully unintuitive app that also requires you to unlink the controls from the Switch in order to connect to the app. Every aftermarket controller I’ve used in the past has the ability to program its extra buttons on the fly, and perhaps this particular aspect is a limitation of the Joy-Con design being split, but it’s baffling that NYXI doesn’t make this easier.\nThe RGB lighting along the ends of the face buttons and d-pad, and around each analog stick, is a nice aesthetic touch. A tiny lighting button on the back of the grips lets you cycle through four different settings: off, rainbow effect, solid color, and breathing solid color. For both solid color settings, you can choose seven different colors by holding the lighting button and using the analog stick to cycle through them. Both grips can have their RGB set independently so you can have your own color combo.\nYou still get rumble functionality (although not HD rumble) and gyroscope motion controls when using the Hyperion 2 wirelessly. The last standout feature, however, is the Turbo setting. There are rare cases in which it’ll be beneficial, but thankfully it’s very easy to set for the moments it’s useful. Simply hold the Turbo button, press the button you want to set, and let go – doing this once will set the button to repeat while holding it, doing it a second time will make the button repeat without touching it, and a third time will reset the button to normal.\nWhen it comes to evaluating gaming performance, I put about five hours into using the NYXI Hyperion 2. The first game I played was Metroid Prime Remastered, and with it being a first-person adventure/shooter, the Hyperion 2 really shined. Looking around and aiming at targets to lock on was so much easier thanks to the smooth analog sticks, so while you don’t necessarily need super-precise aiming in this game, the more robust sticks made it more enjoyable. Jumping is already set to one of the bumpers, but that also freed up both back buttons to be used for inputs like weapon switching or going into Morph Ball mode, which was convenient for me. Here, the Turbo function came in clutch – I set it to ZR so I could rapid-fire by holding ZR instead of having it do a charge shot, and I set the MR back button to shoot normally so I could still do charged shots when I needed.\nDoing some cleanup in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was a ton of fun since I love exploring Hyrule for unfinished business, but again, it’s a great game for showcasing the Hyperion 2’s capabilities. I still prefer gyro aiming for making those minute adjustments, but the sticks are so precise that sometimes you don’t need motion controls, especially since the sticks recognize small movements off the deadzone. And having a back button for the sprint action is a godsend for me as well since I can keep controlling the camera at the same time.\nI tend to avoid first-person shooters on Switch primarily for performance reasons, but also because playing handheld with the standard Joy-Con is straight-up bad. Like other great Joy-Con alternatives, the Hyperion 2 remedies the problem with its fantastic analog sticks that are on par with that of the Xbox Series X|S gamepad to make aiming much better – I’d even go as far to say that the nimble micro-switch triggers make firing and aiming-down-sights quicker and lighting on my fingers.\nNYXI rates the Hyperion 2 to have a 10-meter wireless connection distance, which is a little over 30 feet, and that’s accurate. I never had any issues with connectivity when using it detached from the Switch. But since the Hyperion 2 does not come with a center grip to hold the two parts together, I can’t fully recommend it as a Pro controller replacement until one becomes available – that’s a bummer because every other aspect of it works as a full gamepad alternative as well.\nCheck out our roundup of thebest Switch accessories!\nWhile battery life is good, it’s not quite as long as the normal Joy-Con (on account of its more sophisticated features). The Hyperion 2 lasts around 10 hours without RGB lighting and about five hours with RGB lighting on. That’s plenty of juice to use wirelessly, but these are meant to be used in the Switch’s handheld form so that wasn’t a major factor for me. Charging is done by being attached to the Switch itself, and the design doesn’t interfere with the console being docked. However, the Hyperion 2 does consume a bit more battery from your system. It wasn’t a noticeable difference, although it’s worth noting – I’m not exactly a stickler for squeezing every minute of battery life from my Switch, so it didn’t concern me all that much.\nThe NYXI Hyperion 2 is available for $79.99 (the same price as the regular Joy-Con) directly fromthe NYXI website.\nI wish the NYXI Hyperion 2 came around much sooner, because it’s the best aftermarket Joy-Con set I’ve used throughout the Nintendo Switch’s lifecycle. Its clicky mouse-like buttons are responsive and easy on the fingers, the grips fill up my hands comfortably without being hefty, and the Hall Effect analog sticks blow the Joy-Con sticks out of the water. The back buttons are super convenient, and the simple Turbo function came in handy in some rare instances. If it came with an attachable grip for better use as a gamepad alternative and had an easier way to map the back buttons, this would be an even better package. First-party Nintendo accessories tend to come at a premium, so relative to the competition and its high quality, the NYXI Hyperion 2 is reasonably priced at $79.99 (which is the same as a new pair of regular Joy-Con). Is it too late to pick up given that the Switch 2’s Joy-Con sport an entirely new design? Maybe. But if you’re still in the market for a new Switch controller, the Hyperion 2 is a smart choice."

Rebellion is the developer behind the popular Sniper Elite series of games, as well as the spin-off Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army entries.\nHere's the official blurb:\n“We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall,” said Jason Kingsley CBE, CEO and co-founder of Rebellion.\n“To have surpassed the 1 million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off.\n“We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series.\n“We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game.”\nWhile Atomfall launched simultaneously across PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series X and S and Xbox One,it also released on Game Pass as a day-one title, which will have significantly boosted player numbers.\nRebellion did not say how many copies of the game were sold, however, preferring, like Assassin’s Creed Shadows maker Ubisoft, to go down the player number route. But it did provide some fun stats to back up it announcement.\nOver 316,000 Atomfall players, for example, have killed the scientist at the very beginning of the game.

    "full_text": "Samsung came in strong with today’s deals, and I have to admit, I’m eyeing a couple of them up.The 49-inch Odyssey G9 gaming monitorlooks like something pulled straight from a sci-fi movie.The Galaxy Tab S10+ 5Gis basically a laptop in disguise, and theGalaxy Z Flip 6is making flip phones cool again. If that’s not enough, theS24 Ultrais here to remind every other smartphone who’s boss, and theSSD dealsare giving me a solid excuse to finally clean up my storage situation.\n\nSome of these discounts are impressive, like$500 off that insane QD-OLED monitor. Others, like theSonic statueandRimWorld deal, are more like little bonus treats for the fans. Either way, if you’ve been waiting for a solid sale on a gaming monitor, a high-end phone, or a storage upgrade, Samsung has something worth looking at today.\nAliExpress has brand new PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch OLED consoles on sale for prices you won't find anywhere else. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming console that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by youraccount, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item.\nI want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.\nThis phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.\nI didn’t know I needed an 11-inch Sonic statue until now. The detail is impressive, the LED lights make it pop, and it’s half off. If you’re a Sonic fan, this is an easy yes. If you’re not, well, now’s a great time to start.\nI can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.\nRimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.\nThis SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.\nI never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.\nI think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.\nApple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.\nBeats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstars-grand-theft-auto-5-enhanced-now-the-worst-user-reviewed-gta-on-steam",
    "full_text": "Rockstar’s new and improved version ofGrand Theft Auto 5isn’t going down well on Steam following its launch earlier in March.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 5 Enhanced, which released on March 4, has a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, with 54% of the 19,772 user reviews flagged as positive.\nTo put that into context, the original GTA 5 on Steam, now unlisted at the request of Rockstar Games and as a result unable to appear in search on Valve's platform, has a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam.\nIn fact, GTA 5 Enhanced is currently the worst user-reviewed GTA on Steam, with its closest competitor for the unwanted crown,Grand Theft Auto III – The Definitive Edition, on 66% positive reviews.\nGTA 5 Enhanced is a free upgrade for GTA 5 on PC that includes sought-after features previously only available in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S versions ofGTA Online— including all the latest vehicles and performance upgrades available at Hao’s Special Works, animal encounters, and access to purchase a GTA+ Membership — along with improved graphics options and faster loading times. All players who currently own GTA 5 on PC can upgrade to this new version for free, with the ability to migrate your Story Mode and Online progress.\nYou’d think that would be a relatively straightforward process, but it appears the account migration isn’t working as intended for many players. Indeed, account migration problems are at the heart of most of the negative reviews flagged as ‘most helpful.’\n“ ‘The GTA Online profile associated with this Rockstar Games account is not eligible for migration at this time,’ ” reported one disgruntled player. “If you think I'm throwing away nearly 700 hours of gameplay on one character so that you can make a few more bucks off me, then you can lick my anal orifice clean.\n“This is an objective downgrade from the ‘old’ version. Gonna pretend this was never released and continue to enjoy Legacy version until the new game comes out when I'm 60.”\n“I'm leaving a negative review mainly due to Rockstar deciding that some accounts should arbitrarily not be able to migrate, and if you ask for help from support, they just say they can't do anything about it,” reads another.\n\"I can't migrate either of my two accounts,\" another negative review reads. \"R* support is completely useless and can't help. With the game being over 10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years old I am sure as hell not going to completely restart all my progress in Online just to get marginally better graphics (if that) and HSW and whatever other minuscule ♥♥♥♥ they added.\"\nDespite these issues, GTA 5 Enhanced remains one of the most-played games on Steam, with a 187,059 peak concurrent player count since launch. But it has sparked concern over the inevitable PC release ofGrand Theft Auto 6, with some PC gamers worrying that Rockstar's struggles with GTA 5 Enhanced could signal launch trouble down the line.\nGTA 6 is planned for launch during the fall of 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only, leaving PC gamers out in the cold. In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstarattempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hitsconsole, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.\nWe’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including Take-Two boss StraussZelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out. Meanwhile,Take-Two has sued online marketplace PlayerAuctions, alleging it contains \"thousands of listings for unauthorized, infringing GTA 5 content – including heavily modified player accounts, in-game assets, and virtual currency – all gained by using hacking software, cheats, and technical exploits.\"\nAnd in other news,Rockstar recently acquiredGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Editiondeveloper Video Games Deluxeand renamed it Rockstar Australia.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "full_text": "It's the day before theNintendo Switch 2 Direct, with less than 24 hours to go until Nintendo reveals its plans for its next console. A new Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filing could, potentially, point to some of those plans, at least when it comes to its Switch 2 controller lineup.\n\nAs spotted onFamiboardsand picked up by Nintendo-centric sites likeGoNintendo, an FCC filing emerged yesterday, March 31, from Nintendo. Under product code \"BEE-008,\" it looks to be a registration for a new game controller. Some fans believe this to be the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.\nIt bears mentioning that this is speculaton, as Nintendo hasn't confirmed plans for a Switch 2 Pro Controller yet. However, a few features do seem to indicate this would be a Pro Controller, like Bluetooth and NFC capability.\nThe big thing to note about this filing, if this is the Switch 2 Pro Controller, is that it could include a headphone jack. The original Switch 1 Pro Controller didn't have a headphone jack of any kind, while controllers like the DualSense and Xbox Series controllers do feature a port.\nThis would be a nice quality-of-life feature, if this holds true for the Switch 2 Pro Controller.Past Nintendo filingshave given us a glimpse of the company's plans in advance, so there's some reason to entertain speculation about this controller. We've yet to see it though, so barring any more leaks between now and tomorrow, we'll likely have confirmation once Nintendo announces its full plans for the Switch 2.\nThe Switch 2 Directairs tomorrow at 6am PT / 9am ET on Nintendo's channels. We'll be getting a \"closer look\" at the Switch 2, after its initial reveal earlier this year, and hopefully a lot of solid information leading up to a potential release date.\nNintendo has confirmed the Switch 2 Direct will run for an hour. Two Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2 presentations with hands-on gameplay have been scheduled for April 3 and April 4 as well, starting at 7am PT each day.\nEric is a freelance writer for IGN."

    "full_text": "A Minecraft Movieis now in theaters, and it turns out the team behind the film built their own Minecraft private server that was accessible to the whole cast and crew in order to make the movie as authentic as possible. In fact, Jack Black himself set out to prove he was a \"real Minecrafter\" and built a massive mansion on top of the highest mountain -- with an art gallery.\n\nHaving Minecraft so readily available was a huge help for the filmmakers when creating A Minecraft Movie, and producer Torfi Frans Ólafsson told IGN it fostered a feeling of \"being in an indie game studio, where things are jamming and ideas are floating around everywhere.\" While they couldn't utilize every idea that came out of that as the \"train was already moving,\" it did give them a chance to \"add a little pizzazz\" on top of the film and make it feel true to the game.\nA Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess added that Black, who plays Steve in the film, was all the way in on playing Minecraft and proving he could stand toe-to-toe with the best.\n\"It was so much fun,\" Hess said. \"Jack was super-weirdly method with the game. He was in his trailer harvestinglapis lazuliand always building stuff. [He] was geeking out on the game and would come back with ideas. It was a constantly evolving thing where everybody was contributing in their own fun, unique way.\"\n\"I had an Xbox in my trailer and I did play becausean actor prepares,\" Jack Black added with a grin. \"So I got as many hours as I could on this Minecraft server, which had tons of props from all the different departments.\n\"The cast and crew on the server were building some insane structures and I wanted to stand out. I wanted everyone to know that I wasa real Minecrafter,so I said I was going to find the biggest, highest mountain in this world and build a stairway to Steve and a mansion up on top of that hill. I had a basement in there with an art gallery and... I don't even know if it's still there!\"\n\"It's up!\" Ólafsson confirmed. \"I kept it up and I extended it for a year. I popped up in there a couple days ago and I said, 'Wait, there's somebody online!' I went in, and there were these two security guards who worked the gate on set and and they're like, 'Hey, welcome!' I said, \"You guys are still in here?' and they said, \"Oh, yeah!\"\nWhile it remains to be seen if we'll ever see Jack Black's 'Real Minecrafter' Mansion, it's always a joy to hear what goes into making a movie and how these filmmakers brought the beloved game to life.\nFor more, check outour review of A Minecraft Movie,our explainer ofthe film's ending and post-credits scene,and how it hadthe biggest domestic box office debut in history for a video game adaptationlast weekend.\nAdam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

    "full_text": "Gaming fans are feeling the heat after Nintendo announced itsSwitch 2 U.S. pre-order date was delayedas a direct result of the newly announced tariffs posed by the Trump Administration.\n\nWednesday morning, Nintendo fully unveiled its hybrid console sequel alongside plans to open pre-orders come April 9 — news thatDonald Trump would soon implement sweeping tariffs across the globearrived just hours later. It was a moment of whiplash that the industry is still struggling to come to grips with, and now, two days later, the average gaming fan is already feeling the impact.\n“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,” Nintendo said in a statement shared with IGN. “Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”\nI really hate being right. I kept telling folks that things can literally change tomorrow. People kept yelling at me that the tariffs won't affect us...aight man 😒\n46% tariff on Vietnamese imports announced now.Nintendo Switch 2 are produced there…It’s so fucking over.pic.twitter.com/5N1iAMI2Jm\nthey’re gonna make it even more expensivepic.twitter.com/5Y8FL9FZF6\n“Wait a minute… are you sayingwehave to pay the tariffs??” oneReddit user commented. “Who could have possibly foreseen this?!”\nWhile pre-order timing for other territories, including the UK, remains unchanged, Nintendo didn’t mince words when it came to how tariffs will affect those in the United States. However, changes to a release schedule, even when it comes to something as simple as pre-order timing, signal that Nintendo has more on its mind than it has revealed thus far.\nThere were fears that Nintendo’s proposed $450 Switch 2 price and$80 gamesmight be too big of an ask pre-tariffs — amovement aiming to get Nintendo to lower its price plansalready began shortly after that initial reveal — but the struggle for affordable games is just getting started. While someanalysts had suggestedSwitch 2 prices were calculated with potential tariffs in mind, Nintendo’s announcement today suggests those numbers have room to increase.\nSo thenThose WERE the pre tariff pricesYeah the Switch and Mario Kart bout to be 650 after taxes\nAmericans checking the updated Switch 2 prices after complaining about the old oneshttps://t.co/fsC60LU5YEpic.twitter.com/t4RwqXia8J\nNintendo hasn’t announced when or if its Switch 2 prices will change, but there is plenty of reason to worry they will shift in a more expensive direction. What began as a wave of frustration aimed at the current Switch 2 price has now evolved into an ocean of people who, of course, are still angry, but now they are just hoping they’ll be able to afford the new console.\n“This unironically frustrates me so much,” anotherReddit user added. “The switch 2 was already going to be quite expensive (compared to the OG) but I was still okay with paying the extra money for it. The games were another blow. Was too expensive already but whatever. But this? Huge tariffsPlus Sales taxPlus tariffs on the games???\n“I don’t want to pay 130$ for a damn copy of a game or 600$ for the new Switch. I genuinely (think) this will impact the amount of people able to buy into all of this. I shouldn’t as an average person be priced out of this, yet I probably will be. Augh…”\nI feel bad for all my US followers. If you thought the Switch 2 price was expensive before. It looks like its going to get even worse due to new tariffs.\nWe'vespoken to other industry analystswho acknowledge that these unprecedented tariffs have gamers and game-makers walking into uncharted territory and that there's no telling what exactly will happen with the Switch 2. While some believe we could soon see a price increase, others aren't so sure, but all agree that the industry will no doubt feel the impact of the Trump Administration's wide-reaching tariff plans.\nThe Switch 2 is Nintendo’s latest groundbreaking console, but a suddenly increased price could be just the start of what’s to come. Wespoke with Entertainment Software Association (ESA) spokesperson Aubrey Quinn to learn more about how Trump’s unprecedented tariffs will impact video game fans moving forward. As many have already feared, the ESA says there’s no reason to believe the damage will stop at Nintendo.\nIt does not stop at Nintendo Switch 2 btw.-PC parts like CPU's and GPU's are gonna go up-Laptops going up-Anything Tech related is going up.Next PlayStation and Xbox gonna require a blood sacrifice.\nThe prices of your consoles, tech, and pretty much every daily necessity are about to go up.There's a good chance Nintendo is about to announce a price hike for the Switch 2.

    "publishedAt": "2025-03-28T18:05:18Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-says-kids-dont-care-about-consoles-8-year-olds-arent-dreaming-of-playstation-6",
    "full_text": "Netflix's President of Games, Alain Tascan, is expecting a future generation that relies less on gaming consoles as major players like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo push forward with new hardware.\n\nThe lead of the streaming giant’s video game division shared his thoughts on how gaming fans might soon play their favorite titles during an interview withThe Game Businessthat took place following a Netflix presentation in San Francisco. During the event itself, Tascan was asked if the streamer had any intention of taking a crack at console gaming, but he’s not so sure younger gamers are even interested in what something like a PlayStation 6 could bring to the table.\n“[When it comes to] console, we started to look at the future where the platform is agnostic,” he explained. “Look at the younger generation. Are eight year-olds and 10 year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6? I am not sure. They are wanting to interact with any digital screen, whatever it is, wherever it is, even in the car. With console you’re thinking about high definition, you’re thinking about the controller […] If we look at this older model, I think it will restrain us.”\nTascan told The Game Business that he’s got a soft spot for console gaming despite his concerns, specifically calling out Nintendo’s Wii as a personal favorite. He’s spent many years at studios such as EA, Ubisoft, and Epic Games in the past, so the idea of more traditional console game releases is far from foreign for him. For Netflix, though, things are trending in a different direction.\nWhile the company has a proven track record for creating game adaptations for its IPs with subscription add-ons like Stranger Things 3: The Game, Too Hot to Handle: Love Is a Game, and more, it’s also experimented with giving users access to notable, familiar games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition. Each game can be played straight from a mobile phone if a subscriber chooses, and as Tascan clarified during that recent event, Netflix will be doubling down on this strategy as it develops party games and establishes itself as a hub for kids and gamer families.\n“I am very vigorous about lowering friction and eliminating it if we can,” he told The Game Business. “I see that the subscription is friction as well. Maybe good friction because it makes business sense, but still we did the test of eliminating subscription for [mobile game] Squid Game: Unleashed. And we may do other tests.”\nHe continued: “But the other friction is having enough controllers for family. Having a piece of hardware that might be expensive, that’s another friction. Waiting for a game to download, that’s another friction. I am [looking at] all the obstacles, and asking if we can reduce them as much as possible.”\nNetflix said in early 2024 that games engagement had tripled throughout 2023, signaling that it would continue investing in the space in the future after a 2021CNBCreport suggestedless than 1% of subscribers were tapping into its gamesofferings. In October 2024, the streaming giant cut back on its gaming ambitions when itshut down its AAA studio headed by former Overwatch, Halo, and God of War developers. AGame Developerreport from last month said cuts had also recently hit Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, a teamNetflix picked up in 2021.\nAs Netflix seeks to tap into a market that it expects to be uninterested in game consoles, there’s little reason to doubt we’ll see something like aPlayStation 6ornext Xboxfrom Sony and Microsoft, respectively. Nintendo, meanwhile, is teetering on the edge of a brand-new console generation with itshighly anticipated Switch 2 device. It will pull back the curtain on its new tech with a focused Direct presentation next week, with many fans expecting to hear more aboutwhat features the Switch 2 brings to the table, its release date, andhow pre-orders are being handled.\nPhoto by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images.\nMichael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

    "full_text": "Path of Exile 2developer Grinding Gear Games has fully detailed the first major content update since the action RPG’s early access launch last year.\n\nDawn of the Hunt goes live at 9pm CET on April 4, and adds the new Huntress class. The Huntress is a Spear and Buckler user specialising in hybrid melee and ranged combat. Elsewhere, there are five new ascension classes: the Ritualist, Amazon, Smith of Kitava, Tactician, and Lich.\nPlayers can also expect dozens of new encounters in the endgame, significant mechanical overhauls, over one hundred new unique items as well as significantly expanded crafting options.\nThe long wait for the Path of Exile 2 early access launch finally came to an end when it released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on December 6, 2024. It saw massive success,securing its place as the 15th most-played game Steam game ever.\nBut the game ran into issues, both technical and in design. GGG has worked to update the game in the months since, culminating in next month's Dawn of the Hunt release.\nAt the same time, GGG continues to operate the first Path of Exile game, which still enjoys a healthy playerbase on Steam, as a live service. But this has proved challenging. In January,GGG was forced to apologize to fans of the first gameafter putting a new update on hold until a crucial update for Path of Exile 2 was released.\nMeanwhile,Path of Exile 2 has found itself embroiled in an online disputethat revolves around X / Twitter owner Elon Musk’s admission that he paid someone to boost his account. When contacted by IGN, Grinding Gear Games declined to comment.\nObliterate your enemies with the hybrid ranged and melee Huntress\nStep into the bloodstained boots of the Huntress, a dexterous and ferocious spear-wielding warrior. Banished from her homeland, she now stalks her prey using both ranged spear throws and close combat attacks. Her brutal arsenal is designed to make combat feel like a relentless pursuit, always in motion, moving into and out of melee range at a moments notice.\nThe Huntress can also Parry incoming attacks from monsters, stunning them before following up with one of several counterattacks. For example, use Disengage after a Parry to quickly jump back, gaining a Frenzy charge, then follow up with an empowered spear throw.\nStalk your prey with an array of elemental spear attacks that empower the Huntress to use some of the longest combo chains we have created on any class.\nCreate mayhem with five new ascendancy classesWith five new Ascendancy Classes, Dawn of the Hunt introduces fresh new ways to expand your build options.\nSharpen your arsenal with new skill and support gemsAs well as20 New Spear Skillsdesigned for the huntress, we have two other much anticipated abilities.\nThis expansion also brings a massive overhaul to character development by addingover 100 new Support Gemsto enhance build diversity. Support gems add a variety of interesting effects to your existing skills, modifying them in game changing ways.\nFor example, Haemocrystals turn bleed effects into explosive Vaal crystals, and Caltrops allow your existing skills to litter the battlefield with slowing hazards.\nUnlock greater potential with Over 100 new Unique ItemsDawn of the Hunt brings a stronger focus on Mid and Endgame Unique items, ensuring high-level characters have more thrilling bounty to chase.\nUnbridled power awaits with new crafting toolsNew crafting tools have been introduced as rewards across many areas of the game:\nDarkness lurks aheadThe Azmeri Spirit has made itself present in Wraeclast. When approached, these wisps will flee, and monsters it comes into contact with will be infused by it, making them more powerful. Wisps will also find and possess Rare or Unique monsters, granting them powerful new abilities, and powerful new rewards. There are twelve distinct types of wisp, each with their own mechanics and rewards.\nNew MapsDawn of the Hunt adds eight new Maps offering fresh challenges and rewards. Each of them come with interesting new encounters.\nBe forced to fight mirrored Rare monsters in a shifting, warped reality inThe Fractured Lake, or be thrust into the wild Ezomyte Forests ofThe Phaaryl Megalithswhere rune-carved stones surge with energy.  Survive the storm-fueled gauntlet of deadly boss waves, and you’ll earn full boss rewards and exclusive Runes\nUnique Strongboxes\nFind four new Unique Strongboxes, each with deadly mechanics and valuable rewards.\nCorrupted Essences\nEssences receive major upgrades, with four new Corrupted Essences -Hysteria, Delirium, Horror, and Insanity- offering new combat mechanics and powerful new crafting outcomes, such as guaranteed double Enchantments when using a Vaal Orb on belts.\nCleanse the CorruptionCorruption has continued to spread throughout Wraeclast and has formed into larger and larger zones. In the centre of each one lies a Corrupted Nexus, the home of three new terrifying bosses, amalgamations of Corruption itself.\nUpon defeating these bosses, any remaining areas within the zone of Corruption will become cleansed. Cleansed Maps have additional new monsters, a new boss and their own set of Modifiers and rewards.\nDuel with Rogue ExilesOn your travels you will sometimes encounter Rogue Exiles - others like you who have been exiled and are openly hostile. They will challenge you - a fight to the death. These Exiles have capabilities to Dodge Roll, avoid your abilities with smart pathfinding, smart-targeting, and much more action-packed gameplay. Rogue Exiles use the same skills available to players, and even the same items. They aren't just dressed up in those items, they know how to take advantage of the Uniques they are using.\nOf course, if you are able to slay these Exiles, those items will all drop on the ground!\nDynamic improvements to endgameDawn of the Hunt significantly rebalances the endgame. The number of towers has been drastically reduced but they have been made much more powerful. Tablets now affect twice as many areas and running higher tier Maps in Towers increases this number further still. In addition, each Tower will be able to consume up to three Tablets at once.\nThese changes significantly reduce the amount of busy work required in endgame while improving your ability to use them. On top of that, Towers can now spawn with all mechanics, and have their own new Bosses!\nPrepare for the HuntRise as a hunter, or fall as prey on April 4th. The Dawn of the Hunt content update will also be made available in existing Early Access leagues for those wishing to play their existing characters. It is recommended to start anew in a fresh economy to get the full, recommended experience in the Dawn of the Hunt leagues.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

    "full_text": "Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2is getting a big update today. Patch 1.2 is out now, and alongside fixes and improvements, there's both a barber shop and Steam Workshop modding support added to the massive RPG.\n\nThe barber shop is the first of \"several\" planned free DLCs, per a press release from Warhorse, and will let protagonist Henry visit the barber to change up his hairstyle. There's also an option for either a clean-shaven or rugged appearance, as well as facial hair ranging from stubble to beard. A new haircut will, just like in real life, give Henry a temporary boost to charisma.\nPatch 1.2 (massive patch notes below!) addresses over 1,000 fixes and improvements, including equipment and NPC behavior, as well as gameplay balance. Specifically, developer Warhorse Studios tackled country-specific localization as well. The new patch for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 refines the Chinese translations, both Traditional and Simplified, improves the Korean font for clarity, and has a newly recorded French voiceover.\nAs for modding, dedicated Steam modding support has arrived alongside the barber DLC and Patch 1.2. The toolkit allows players to tinker with over 300 elements in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, ranging from user interface and combat mechanics to AI behavior. \"Whether making subtle tweaks or complete overhauls, the possibilites for customization are vast,\" Warhorse said. The studio plans on discussing these updates further during a developer stream, set for March 20, 2025.\nAdditional content isexpected to roll out for the historical RPG throughout the year, with its first paid content drop \"Brushes with Death\" set for this summer. The Legacy of the Forge expansion is expected in autumn, and then this winter, Warhorse aims to release Mysteria Ecclesia, which involves a covert mission in the Sedlec Monastery.\nThe latest from Warhorse Studios doesn't show any sign of slowing down in sales, either. The sequelsold 2 million copies in less than two weeks, andEmbracer has hailed the game as a success. Inour own review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 at IGN, the RPG got high marks for its melee combat, story, and a \"truly dynamic\" open-world sandbox.\nGetting started in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?
