It’s a list of 26 titles thatGOG sayswill “remain playable in their best versions” that players can safely assume they’ll have access to for years to come.\nSilent Hill 4: The Room is one title that will benefit from the GOG Preservation Program in more ways than one. In addition to securing its future, GOG says the entry’s status with the service means it comes with “missing content that was never available on PC before.” This includes the reintroduction of Hauntings, which spruce up that iconic Silent Hill atmosphere with spooky effects, such as flickering lamps and possessed telephones. Modern controller support has also been added.\nF.E.A.R. Platinum, which waspromised last month, arrives as an especially nice addition, too, as its original developer, Monolith Productions, wasshuttered by Warner Bros. last month.

More than 100 games are supported through the program, and judging by today’s announcement, the list will only continue to grow.\n\"The GOG Preservation Program is our commitment to preserving gaming history,\" GOGsaid at the time of its reveal late last year. \"Through the program, players can trust that their games will always be up to date and ready to run on current and future PC setups.\n\"Whether it’s manuals, DLCs, or missing features, we’re offering the most complete version possible, backed by GOG’s tech support and offline installers, so you can safeguard these classics for years to come.\"\nMichael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

    "full_text": "Speculation thatStarfieldwill soon be confirmed for release on PlayStation 5 ramped up over the weekend after fans spotted a PlayStation logo on Bethesda’s official Creations website.\n\nThe logo was attached to a work-in-progress ship decals Creation for Starfield, and although the Creation was removed, fans are speculating that Bethesda’s so-far PC and Xbox-only sci-fi game is soon set for PS5.\nThoughts inevitably turn to whether Bethesda plans a significant content update, possibly even a new expansion, to coincide with Starfield’s seemingly inevitable release on PS5. There’s been little to shout about when it comes to Starfield in recent months, following the launch of the poorly receivedShattered Space expansion. Bethesda parent company Microsoft is expected to hold another summer showcase this year, as it has done in recent years, and that event may be the right time and place to learn more about all things Starfield.\nBethesda itself has said it has \"exciting things\" planned for Starfield this year, amid growing discontent from players about a lack of communication and updates. In June 2024,Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supportingStarfield, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. In an interview withYouTube channel MrMattyPlays, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”\nStarfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new intellectual property in years, and its first mainline single-player game since Microsoft bought parent company ZeniMax Media in March 2021. IGN’sStarfield reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist.”\nIn January,Microsoft’s gaming boss Phil Spencer refused to rule out Starfield coming out on PS5.Starfield and MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were both reported as being considered for PS5 as far back as March 2024. Indy ended up confirmed for PS5 with a spring 2025 release window, a few months after its release on PC and Xbox Series X and S. But Starfield is yet to be confirmed for PS5, although Spencer's comments certainly suggested it was on the cards.\nA number of Xbox games are currently available on PS5, including Rare’s Sea of Thieves, Tango Gameworks’ Hi-Fi Rush, and Obsidian’s Grounded and Pentiment. Microsoft already publishes Minecraft games on PlayStation consoles, among many other platforms, and is set to publish Doom: The Dark Ages and Ninja Gaiden 4 on PS5 later this year. Playground’s Forza Horizon 5 is also confirmed as coming to PS5 soon. There are even reports thatMicrosoft is finally ready to release Halo on PlayStation after decades of Xbox exclusivity.\nSpencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.\n“We run a business,”Spencer said in August last year. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.\n“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”\nIt’s a busy time for the 450-person Bethesda Game Studios, which currently operates five teams: Starfield; Elder Scrolls 6; Fallout 76; mobile; and external development partnerships.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "full_text": "There is enormous pressure onAssassin's Creed Shadowsto do well for Ubisoft globally after a number of delays and the sales failure of last year’sStar Wars Outlaws. Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number ofhigh-profile flops,layoffs,studio closures, andgame cancellationsin the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release.\n\nThings have got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family isreportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investorson a buyout deal that would let it preserve control of the company's intellectual property.\nSo, the video game world is watching Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ early performance closely for signs of its success — or failure. So far, Ubisoft has yet to announce a sales figure, but has saidAssassin's Creed Shadows hit 2 million players just two days after launch, surpassing the launches of both Origins and Odyssey.\nThere’s also a lot of attention on Shadows’ Steam concurrents, which are being compared to those of other triple-A single-player games that recently released, as well as previous Assassin’s Creed games on Valve’s platform.\nShadows became the most-played Assassin's Creed game ever on Steam over the weekend with 64,825 peak concurrent players, although it’s worth noting that it was the first game in the series to launch day-one there since 2018's Odyssey. BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardsaw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.\nIt’s hard to make a call on whether Shadows is below, meeting, or exceeding Ubisoft’s expectations without knowing what those expectations were. But a source from within Ubisoft, who revealed an internal email reviewed by IGN, has helped us better understand the game’s first weekend performance.\nHere’s what we’ve found out: Shadows delivered the second-highest day-one sales revenue in the franchise’s history, behind only 2020’s Valhalla, which launched across the last and current generation of consoles and benefited from stay-at-home gaming fueled by the pandemic.\nShadows also marked Ubisoft’s best ever day-one launch on the PlayStation Store, suggesting particular success on PS5.\nBut what about PC, given Shadows launched on Steam as well as Ubisoft’s own digital store? According to Ubisoft’s internal communication, 27% of Shadows’ total “activations” were on PC. Ubisoft is telling employees that Steam “played a major role” in Shadows’ performance on PC, without revealing exact sell-through numbers. It says early results “are a strong validation of our decision to return to the platform.”\nGenerally, Ubisoft is talking up player engagement, which is at “record levels,” and “feedback across moderated, verified platforms — those less affected by review bombing — remains incredibly positive.” Shadows was also the most-wishlisted Ubisoft game of all time, and it’s doing better than any other Assassin’s Creed game on Twitch, even Valhalla.\nIt’s here that Ubisoft’s internal communication provides context on comparisons between Shadows’ launch and other games in the franchise. What’s clear is that Shadows is not doing as well as Valhalla did at launch, but Ubisoft is saying it’s not fair to compare the two, because Valhalla benefitted from the “perfect storm” of pandemic-fueled stay-at-home gaming and the launch of the Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5 in 2020.\n“Valhalla launched under extraordinary conditions — in the middle of a global pandemic, with widespread lockdowns and brand-new console hardware,” the internal communication reads. “It was a perfect storm we may never see again. That’s why it’s more meaningful to compare Shadows to entries like Origins, Odyssey, and Mirage — games released in more typical cycles. And in that frame, Shadows is already setting a new bar as illustrated above.”\nUbisoft also pointed out that Shadows released in March. Historically, Assassin’s Creed games launch just ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving window, which typically boosts sales. Meanwhile, Ubisoft ditched the early access period it normally charges extra for with its games. It’s also worth noting that Ubisoft’s own subscription offering is now available directly on Xbox, which affects sales on Microsoft’s console and muddies sales comparisons.\nMoney talks, of course, and irrespective of player numbers and engagement, it will be revenue brought in by Assassin’s Creed Shadows that determines the fate of not just the game, but Ubisoft itself. We may not get a clear picture of that until Ubisoft's next financial report in the coming months.\nAdventuring across feudal Japan?

    "full_text": "Monster Hunter Wildsis laying out its future roadmap. Alongside its planned Title Updates, director Yuya Tokuda has confirmed a few additional goals the team has, as post-launch support for the latest entry in the Monter Hunter franchise carries on.\n\nIn aletter from the director, Tokuda started by laying out the roadmapseen in the recent Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase for Title Update 1and beyond. The first big Title Update drops on April 4, this Friday. Then, the seasonal event Festival of Accord: Blossomdance runs from April 23 through May 7. Additionally, April 30 through May 21 will see the Arch-tempered Rey Dau storm into Monster Hunter Wilds.\nAt the end of May, Update Ver. 1.011 will bring an unannounced Capcom collaboration and some \"other additional features.\" Title Update 2 is then planned for this summer, with a new additional monster and seosonal event. Tokuda confirms more free updates are arriving beyond that.\nPart of the Mosnter Hunter Wilds' director's letter dug into the question of challenging monster content. Already, fights like Tempered Arkveld, the aforementioned Arch-tempered Rey Dau, and a refight with Zoh Shia are confirmed. Tokuda also confirmed Mizutsune, arriving with Title Update 1, will have an 8-star Tempered Mizutsune fight, available at HR 41 or higher.\nThe end-of-May update will add even more 8-star Tempered monsters to the Wilds. Tempered versions of Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad will make their way to the game in this update.\n\"Each of these monsters have had various behind-the-scenes adjustments to make them more resilient, such as increased health, resistance to wounding, and tweaks to multiplayer scaling,\" Tokuda said. \"Challenging monsters will also appear in future updates, so keep an eye out for further information about them.\"\nSpecifically addressing feedback from launch, Tokuda said that Capcom is planning to make \"various adjustments,\" including weapon balance changes.\n\"These will be implemented gradually with each upcoming title update in order to make the game more enjoyable for everyone for a longer period of time,\" Tokuda said. \"Depending on the content, these changes may take some time to prepare.\"\nThe director noted the Hammer as one weapon being considered for \"upward adjustments,\" which sounds like good news for Hammer mains. Some \"unintentionally overpowered\" things will be adjusted down — the Corrupted Mantle is one example — but Capcom said it plans on adjusting other parts upward, making for a \"generally balanced\" update. The team is currently aiming to implement the overall weapon balance adjustments in either the end-of-May update or in Title Update 2 this summer.\nAdditionally, Capcom istargeting stability and performance for Monster Hunter Wilds, specifically noting the PC version. Title Update 1 is planned to bring a reduction in VRAM usage and an upgrade to the DirectStorage version of the Steam version, which should result in an \"overall improvement\" of stability for PC players.\nMore improvements are planned, to bolster the overall technical experience for players on all platforms. Additionally, the in-game economy, balance, and other areas are planned for improvement too.\nQuality-of-life is also a major target for the Monster Hunter Wilds team moving forward. The Grand Hub, arriving in Title Update 1, is part of this, condensing various functions into one end-game area. The team has also reduced waiting times for facility functions at each location.\nThe team is continuing to work on UI/UX improvements and other quality-of-life updates too. A few items on the docket include restocking items, checking skill information, engaging in multiplayer quests, using the Seikret, and camera behavior during hunts.\nThe rollout stars with Title Update 1 this Friday, April 4, and on into the summer as we approach Title Update 2. Though it's still fresh, Monster Hunter Wilds isalready one of the year's most popular games, and it doesn't look like Capcom is planning to slow down its roadmap for it anytime soon.\nEric is a freelance writer for IGN."

    "full_text": "Update 3/14/25 12:02 p.m. ET: Like most limited-edition PS5 hardware releases, the stock situation for this controller appears to be severely, uh, limited. It's currently (possibly!) available atPS Direct. Stock is also holding steady atGameStop, but you can only preorder it if you have a Pro membership (you cansign up herefor $25/year).\n\nIt's currently sold out atAmazon,Best Buy,Target, andWalmart, though it's possible any of them could get more stock at some point. I'll keep updating this article as things change.\nHere’s one for the post-apocalyptic crowd: Sony is releasing a new limited-edition The Last of Us-themed DualSense controller. ThePS5 controllerfeatures an eye-catching black and white design, with trophy icons from The Last of Us Part I and Part II etched into it. It comes out April 10 with an MSRP of $84.99. Preorders are live now at various retailers (see it on PS Direct). Read on for the details.\nThe controller was made “in close collaboration” with the Naughty Dog creative team. It features white-on-black icons of the Fireflies’ logo on the touchpad, with the moth and wolf on either side of the grips. A number of other icons also appear in glossy black on matte black. The bottom side of the controller has a The Last of Us logo in white on black. It looks very nice and classy overall, I’d say.\nOn thePlayStation Blog, Naughty Dog Head of Studio and Head of Creative Neil Druckmann and Graphic Designer Megan Mehran said:\n“We were excited by the chance to memorialize The Last of Us franchise in a controller that fans and our own team would love. We wanted to ensure that both installments of The Last of Us are represented, via trophy icons printed in black gloss across the controller body. Among the trophies, three particular images will immediately stand out for TLOU fans: The firefly, moth, and wolf. Players will recognize the Fireflies’ iconic spray-painted logo that originated in Part I, while the moth and wolf represent the intertwining lives and duality between Ellie and Abby in Part II.“\nThis isn’t the first PS5 game-themed limited-edition controller to hit the market. Others based on games likeAstro Bot,Helldivers 2,Spider-Man 2, andFortnitehave come out, among others, some of which are still available. And those are in addition to all the otherPS5 controllers in various colorsthat are available.\nThis The Last of Us controller comes out right around a couple of related releases. The Last of Us Part II is coming to PC on April 3, while the second season of theHBO showpremieres on April 13.\nChris Reed is a deals expert and commerce editor for IGN.

    "full_text": "Earlier this year, Dell rebooted the legendaryAlienware Area-51lineup of prebuilt gaming PCs, but until recently you could only configure it with one graphics card option - the RTX 5080. That's no longer the case. Starting now, you can choose to equip your Alienware Area-51 with an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU and - finally - an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 GPU starting at $5,499.99. Better yet, you won't have to wait months for your system to arrive; Dell estimates an early April ship date.\n\nThe $5,500 config might be the \"base\" configuration for an Alienware Area-51 gaming PC equipped with a 5090 GPU, but at that price, I would still expect stacked specs, and fortunately, this configuration delivers. It's equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU, 32GB of DDR5-6400MHz RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. TheCore Ultra 9 285Kis Intel's latest flagship CPU and offers stellar workstation and gaming performance. It's not quite the performance uplift we wanted from the i9-14900K, but right now there's nothing better from the Intel camp. The processor is cooled by a massive 360mm all-in-one liquid cooler, and the system is generously powered by a 1,500W 80Plus Platinum-rated power supply.\nDell unveiled the new Alienware Area-51 gaming PC at CES 2025. The chassis looks similar to the 2024 R16 system with aesthetic and cooling redesigns and updated components. The I/O panel is positioned at the top of the case instead of the front, and the tempered glass window now spans the entire side panel instead of just a smaller cutout. As a result, the side panel vents are gone, and instead air intakes are located at the bottom as well as the front of the case. Alienware is now pushing a positive airflow design (more intake than exhaust airflow), which means a less dusty interior. The internal components have been refreshed with a new motherboard, faster RAM, and more powerful power supply to accommodate the new generation of CPUs and GPUs.\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 has emerged as the most powerful consumer GPU on the market. Although Nvidia has prioritized software updates, AI features, andDLSS 4 technologyto improve gameplay performance, the 5090 still boasts an impressive 25%-30% uplift over the RTX 4090 in terms of pure hardware-based raster performance. The 5090 also has more (32GB vs 24GB) and faster (GDDR7 vs GDDR6) VRAM compared to the 4090. This GPU is extremely difficult to find at retail price andis currently selling for $3,500-$4000 on eBay.\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5090 FE Reviewby Jackie Thomas\n\"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 has officially taken the performance crown from the RTX 4090, but with less force than previous generations. When it comes to traditional non-AI gaming performance, the RTX 5090 provides one of the smallest generational uplifts in recent memory. However, in games that support it, DLSS 4 really does deliver huge performance gains – you just have to make your peace with the fact that 75% of the frames are generated with AI.\"\nCheck out more of thebest Dell and Alienware gaming deals of 2025.\nAmazon listed a couple of Skytech-branded RTX 5090 gaming PCs for an even more attractive price point of $4,799.99 shipped. Note that these don't ship out immediately. They're equipped with capable AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D processors, which perform nearly as well in terms of gaming although they do fall behind when it comes to workstation performance.\n\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "title": "FBC: Firebreak Is the Control Multiplayer FPS I Didn’t Know I Wanted",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-20T21:45:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-is-the-control-multiplayer-fps-i-didnt-know-i-wanted",
    "full_text": "Control was IGN’s Game of the Year in 2019 – and I was one of the many editors that voted for it – but even I was skeptical when Remedy, a studio known for telling great single-player stories in third-person games, announced it was doing a Control multiplayer game. That project turned out to be FBC: Firebreak, a three-player PvE first-person multiplayer shooter set six years after the events of Control. And in the hands-off demo I saw, it very quickly became clear that my skepticism was completely unwarranted. Firebreak is refreshingly original in an oversaturated space, delightfully weird amidst a sea of same-y military and/or sci-fi online shooters, and perhaps best of all, it doesn’t require a massive commitment like so many of its contemporaries. As game director Mike Kayatta put it, \"We're not about daily check-ins. We're not interested in monthly grinds. We don't want to give anybody a second job.\" Say it again, Mike, for the people in the back.\n\nFBC: Firebreak is a three-player co-op FPS with, if what Remedy is promising comes to pass, no nonsense. You can play for 20 minutes or a few hours if you want to, with Perk unlocks and new combinations amongst characters keeping things fresh for repeat runs. But what the heck are you doing here, back in The Oldest House, with a bevy of bizarre weaponry in your hands? Essentially, you are volunteer first responders in The Oldest House when things go seriously sideways. Your characters are secretaries, rangers, and other “normal” occupations who heed the call of service. The Federal Bureau of Control wouldn’t say you’re expendable, but…you’re expendable.\nWhen you log in to play, you choose a Job (aka a mission) and a Crisis Kit (essentially, your loadout) before setting the Threat Level (difficulty) and Clearance Level, which determines how many zones you'll be playing through in a run. The zones are separated by containment doors, which will take you to the next stage of the Job. And the Job I saw is called Paper Chase, and it’s set in a fairly mundane office section of the FBC building. The Hiss are spreading, and it’s up to you and your two teammates to work together to beat them back.\nOf course, you can get the hell out of there as soon as you can if you like, but if you want to get your hands on currencies that let you upgrade and buy new gear, you have to escape safely with them. And the longer you spend exploring for currency, the harder it is to make it back to HQ in one piece.\nSpeaking of gear, that’s where FBC: Firebreak starts to set itself apart from other multiplayer shooters. Many of the guns are charmingly unusual, and most have a homebrew feel, like the hand-cranked snowball-launching gun that can put out fires (or your friends who are on fire) and soak the sticky-note monster (uh, more on him in a bit). Or the cobbled-together zapper that, when fitted with the right nozzle, can rain down lightning storms on a room full of bad guys. Or the large wrench that, when a squeaky piggy bank toy is attached, causes a swirl of coins to pelt your opponents. Don’t worry, though; there are still staples like a machinegun and shotgun – the latter of which is the go-to for after you’ve either soaked or zapped one of the sticky-note monsters.\nOh yes, about them: the entire point of this particular Job is to eliminate all of the sticky notes before they overrun the entire brutalist building. Note the number of sticky notes left to destroy in the upper left corner. It will actually go way up as the mission progresses because, by the end of it, you face off against…a gigantic sticky-note monster. Think Sandman from the end of Spider-Man 3, but made out of sticky Post-It notes instead of sand.\nBut it’s not just about weird weapons. There are also fun in-universe gameplay mechanics, too, like the office supply shelf that refills your ammo, the makeshift turret you build after literally dumping it out of a box onto the floor, the stereo speaker that keeps the Hiss at bay, and the rinse station that washes any aggressive sticky notes off of your face. Unlockable Perks also inject more spice and variety into the gameplay. A couple of examples I saw: a Perk where each missed bullet has a chance to return to your clip, and another that lets you extinguish yourself by jumping up and down. Also, if you get two of the same Perk you get a stronger version of it. If you get three, you can share the Perk’s effect with nearby teammates.\nBy the way, in case you’re wondering, you don’t have to have three people in order to play. You can play solo or in duos as well. Meanwhile, Remedy is aiming for a lower minimum PC spec than usual, but on the opposite end of the spectrum, FBC will also support DLSS4 with multi-frame generation as well as nVidia Reflex and full ray-tracing. It’ll also be Steam Deck verified, and it’s launching into Xbox and PC Game Pass on day one along with PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium. Finally, there is a post-launch content plan that Remedy isn’t ready to share quite yet, and there will be paid cosmetics, but that’s the extent of the microtransactions.\nIn fairness, I haven’t actually played FBC: Firebreak yet, so I have to be cautious about my enthusiasm. But so far, it certainly passes the eye test. This is almost certainly not a run-of-the-mill multiplayer shooter, in a very good way. And the fact that it’s a get-in and get-out online game that doesn’t require a massive ongoing time commitment in order to enjoy it is a refreshing throwback to the days when that was the norm.\nRyan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show,Podcast Unlocked, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show,IGN Unfiltered.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/sk-hynix-p41-platinum-ssd-deal-for-ps5-or-gaming-pc",
    "full_text": "Amazon has recently dropped the price on the2TB SK Hynix P41 PlatinumPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVME solid state drive (SSD) to only $124.99 shipped. The SK Hynix P41 Platinum is one of thefastest PCI-E 4.0 SSDs available, has DRAM cache, and is considerably less expensive than other comparable SSDs like theSamsung 990 Pro($168) and theWD SN850X($154). This is an excellent SSD for either your PlayStation 5 console or gaming PC.\n\nUpdate:Price has dropped again from $129.99 to $124.99.\nSK Hynix might not be as recognizable of a brand as Samsung or Western Digital among consumers, but make no mistake that they are a major player in the flash memory market. SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and one of the world's largest memory chipmakers and semiconductor companies. They supply components for many reputable brands you've probably heard of, like Corsair and G.Skill.\nThe Platinum P41 is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read speeds of 7,000MB/s and write speeds of 6,500MB/s as well as random read speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and write speeds of 1.3 million IOPS. The Platinum P41 also has a dedicated DRAM cache, Most SSDs at this price point lack any DRAM cache and instead rely on HMB, or system memory, to cover the shortfall. In terms of reliability and stability, th Platinum P41 has been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written. It uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips, both of which are manufactured in-house. SK Hynix warranties this SSD with a 5 year warranty.\nThe SK Hynix P41 Platinum makes for a great secondary SSD for your PlayStation 5 console since it performs well above Sony's minimum speed recommendation of 5,600MB/s. It's possible this SSD will run fine without a heatsink, but we like to err on the side of caution and would recommend you install one for peace of mind. Besides, you can get a perfectly adequateslim PS5 heatsink for just $7.\nThe Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.\nLooking for more options?

    "full_text": "Ubisoft has hailed anotherAssassin’s Creed Shadowsplayer milestone, but has yet to confirm a sales figure for the game.\n\nIn asocial media post, Ubisoft said Shadows has seen 2 million players since going on sale on March 20, up from the 1 million on day one.\nThat’s enough to surpass the launches of both Assassin’s Creed Origins and Odyssey, Ubisoft added. “Thank you for joining the journey in Feudal Japan!”\nIt’s an impressive start for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but it’s worth bearing in mind that Ubisoft has yet to announce a sales figure for the game. Still, we do know it’s the top-selling game on Steam, where Ubisoft recently returned after years of PC launch exclusivity on the Epic Games Store.\nAt the time of this article’s publication, Assassin’s Creed Shadows was on 58,894 concurrent players on Steam, enough to break into the top 30 most-played games on Valve’s platform. That peak is expected to rise as we continue into the game’s opening weekend.\nFor comparison, Origins’ all-time Steam peak was 41,551, over seven years ago, and Odyssey’s was 62,069. It seems likely Shadows will become the most-played Assassin's Creed game on Steam later this weekend.\nBioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardlaunched on Steam on Thursday, October 31, 2024, and saw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.\nThe true concurrent peak of Assassin’s Creed Shadows will of course be much higher, given it launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S also. Neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.\nThere is enormous pressure on Assassin's Creed Shadows to do well for Ubisoft globally after multiple delays and the sales failure of last year’sStar Wars Outlaws. Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number ofhigh-profile flops,layoffs,studio closures, andgame cancellationsin the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release. Things got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family and largest shareholder arereportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investorson a buyout deal that would let them preserve control.\nAssassin's Creed Shadows has also endured a number of controversies itself, not least in Japan. This week, IGN confirmed thatUbisoft had quietly released a day-one patch for Assassin’s Creed Shadowsthat made a number of important changes seemingly in response to concern from some Japanese politicians about in-game temples and shrines.\nIn a remarkable exchange this week, Japanese politician and member of the House of Councillors of Japan, Hiroyuki Kada, raised the issue of Assassin’s Creed Shadows in an official government meeting, andShigeru Ishiba, the Prime Minister of Japan, responded.\nOn Steam at least, Assassin's Creed Shadows is going down very well with players. It has a 'very positive' user review rating, with 81% of over 6,000 user reviews marked as positive. IGN’sAssassin’s Creed Shadows reviewreturned an 8/10.

    "full_text": "The most surprising reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct might have been a third-party game. Announced near the end of the showcase, FromSoftware is developing a brand-new game calledThe Duskbloods, which has some striking similarities to the beloved PlayStation 4-exclusive Bloodborne.\n\nThe Duskbloods is a new game, to be clear, set to arrive sometime in 2026 worldwide, and exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2. Playing as the \"Bloodsworn,\" a group that has gone beyond humanity thanks to special blood, players will enter a violent melee to become the \"First Blood.\"\nConfirmed in a press release from FromSoftware, The Duskbloods is a PvPvE title with \"online multiplayer at its core,\" with up to eight players battling for the win among themselves. So while all the blood, guns, and machinery brings to mind Bloodborne, it may also have quite a bit in common with the upcomingElden Ring Nightreign, though with some PvP rather than solely co-op PvE.\nWe didn't get much more than that, besides cryptic teases and some looks at some horrifying beasts and bosses. Still, Bloodborne fans are having a wide variety of reactions to this.\n\"BLOOD! EVERY FIVE SECONDS THEY TALKED ABOUT BLOOD!\" saidone commenter in the r/Bloodborne post about The Duskbloods on Reddit. Another said: \"That game is 100% Bloodborne 2. I assume the name change is either because it's in a different setting, or because of Sony exclusivity.\"\nThough The Duskbloods is still different, it's easy to see the connections that would have fans feeling like it's a spiritual sucessor to Bloodborne. And while the Souls games and Elden Ring have gone onto other systems — Elden Ring even got aTarnished Edition locked in for the Switch 2— Bloodborne has remained a PlayStation 4 exclusive since release, not even making it over to PC. A port, sequel, or really anything has been something fans have wanted for years.\n\"Nintendo really got tired of waiting for Bloodborne 2 and just decided to fund it themselves,\" anothercommenter said. Another reply points out that, much like Bloodborne, The Duskbloods is currently a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. \"Bloodborne was always an exclusive, this is on brand,\" areplier added.\nThe announcement definitely kick-started the Bloodborne faithful, though reality has been setting in with confirmation that this sounds like a battle royale-style game, rather than a single-player RPG you'd normally expect from FromSoftware.\nSome commenters startedexpressing dulled excitementover the revelation that The Duskbloods is a PvPvE experience. Threads have sprung up of fans finding this out, only to then express that between a multiplayer focus and Switch 2 exclusivity, they might not be so eager to jump on for The Duskbloods.\nWe're due to learn more about The Duskbloods soon, as Nintendo will post an interview with director Hidetaka Miyazaki on its website on April 4. Presumably this will shed some light on how exactly The Duskbloods will work, what its PvPvE will look like, and whether this can truly be enough to sate the Bloodborne fans who've been holding out hope for so long.\nFor all the other news announced during today's stream, be sure tocheck out our recap of everything announced at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.\nEric is a freelance writer for IGN."

Dark Odyssey is the real headline here, as it includes a war chest of cosmetic treats for all God of War Ragnarök owners across PlayStation 5 and PC. It’ll arrive as a free update March 20.\nEverything included in Dark Odyssey features a clean, black-and-gold look that will no doubt have Kratos and co looking better than ever as they tear their way through Norse mythology. Atreus and Freya both receive their own cosmetic sets as part of the patch, too, as do a variety of the player’s shields and weapons.\nThe show-stealer, though, is a Dark Odyssey appearance and armor set for Kratos that hearkens back to a skin originally only rewarded to players who managed to beat God of War 2 on God Mode difficulty. Players can claim the content in any Lost Items chest in the base game or immediately in God of War Ragnarök’s roguelike Valhalla mode after the update drops. The patch will also finally introduce the option to customize the appearance of Kratos’ weapons without sacrificing each weapon’s respective ability.\nDark Odyssey Armor & Appearance for Kratos\nDark Odyssey Companion Armor\nDark Odyssey Weapon Appearances & Attachments\nDark Odyssey Shield Appearances & Rönd\nGod of War Ragnarök released in late 2022, so one simple update was never going to do the series’ 20-year history justice. Also included in Sony’s plans to celebrate God of War is a long list of other activities and offers for those who have stuck with Kratos’ story since the beginning. Highlights include a collection of some snazzy social media assets (that you can downloadhere), an art showcase coming as part ofa collaboration with Los Angeles’ Gallery Nucleus, new merch, sales, multiple vinyl releases covering the franchise’s history, and more.

His sheathed blades rest at his side in a sling, a bold reminder to his enemies of his roots in the Hokushin-Itto-ryu school of swordplay. His intricately detailed haori and hakama ripple in the wind, embodying a legacy that shapes his journey. Every detail echoes past traditions, adorning a hero with hope to bridge the past and the future together.

InIGN's review of Rise of the Ronin, Will Borger wrote, \"Rise of the Ronin marries a cool historical setting, Team Ninja’s mastery of tough-but-fair combat, and some smart RPG design to make a game that is immediately compelling, and even more fun with friends. It’s full of cool little touches, whether it’s throwing something at an enemy with the grappling rope or dropping from your glider onto your horse. Unfortunately, it’s also a game full of map clutter, bloated systems, and a truly absurd amount of junk loot, and the time I spent clearing out everything that didn’t spark joy and dealing with all these non-essential systems made me pine for a leaner, meaner, more focused game. Rise of the Ronin is excellent when it has the courage to be itself and lean into its challenging, rewarding fighting; too often, however, it feels stuck in indecision, torn between what it wants to be and what it feels it’s expected to be, and not even the best samurai can overcome that.\"\nJesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen",
    "full_text": "Editor’s note: This interview was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior toNintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States due to the potential impact of tariffs. Parts of this interview were edited for clarity.\n\nNintendo has finally pulled back the curtain onNintendo Switch 2, revealing the company's vision for its next-generation console and its games. Butovershadowing dicussion around what the Switch 2 is capable of, the new gameplay mechanics inMario Kart World, and OG Switch games that will find a new lease of life on Switch 2, isa backlash to Nintendo's pricing strategy.\nWe sat down with Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience Bill Trinen to talk about the big first-party reveals like Mario Kart World andDonkey Kong Bananza, the strategy behindpricing Switch 2 at $450andMario Kart at $80, the decision to releaseNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour as a paid digital productrather than a pack-in game, his excitement forMetroid Prime 4: Beyond's mouse controlsandMasahiro Sakurai's return to the Kirby franchise, and more. Plus, does Bill know what Switch 2 cartridges taste like? Read our full interview below to find out.\nIGN:Congrats on finally unveiling Nintendo Switch 2. How does it feel to finally have it out there?\nBill Trinen:Well, it's just exciting to be able to get all the details out there. For us, the most important thing is that we really want people to recognize and understand that Nintendo Switch 2 is the true successor to Nintendo Switch, takes what you love about Nintendo Switch, and then builds on it with a whole lot of new features and new capabilities and new games that take advantage of those. And really takes what has evolved gaming with Nintendo into something that's a lot more social through things likeGameChat, which takes what was the anytime, anywhere play of Nintendo Switch and makes it more all together, anytime, anywhere.\nIGN:So you just mentioned GameChat, that was a huge part of your presentation yesterday. Why was now the time to finally introduce Nintendo voice chat, which is something that people have wanted on your consoles for a really long time?\nTrinen:Well, I would say we've always looked at it from the perspective of, 'what is Nintendo's real strength and what are Nintendo's real values?' And for us, the most important thing is putting smiles on people's faces and doing it in a way that people can see and experience the smiles that they have with the people that are most important to them.\nAnd certainly there have been other game systems with chat and things like that up until now, but what we wanted to do was to take something that could finally replicate that same room, couch multiplayer, couch co-op experience and joy, and bring that into an online space. And so for us, GameChat is why it's so important is the combination of being able to see their faces, being able to see what they're doing from a gameplay perspective and being able to feel like you've finally got a virtual space where you can have those same experiences that you might have in your living room. So that's why with the power of, I would say Switch 2, being able to finally execute that has been a big focus for us.\nIGN:Cool. And we always knew if you did voice chat, it would be in the most Nintendo way, and just with the camera and the mic on the unit in the dock and you say, 'oh, don't worry the background noise won't get in.' It was a cool presentation.\nTrinen:Good. And that's the nice thing is with the built-in microphone, it's like, yeah, you can just voice chat if you want and you can do that portably as well.\nIGN:Well, let's talk about Donkey Kong Bananza. I love the title by the way, it's perfect. Although last night when I was scrambling to typemy preview, it autocorrected to 'Bonanza' every time, and I was like, 'I’ve got to add this to my dictionary.' But I love the name and it's so exciting to see DK back in the spotlight after so long. And I noticed so many things just getting my hands on the controller for the first time. So when you guys got this game in at Nintendo of America, what stuck out to you the most? What was your favorite part about working on it from a localization perspective or anything else?\nTrinen:Well, so I'll start with a really terrible joke, which is I like to call this the most groundbreaking game in video game history.\nIGN:[Laughs] I used that in my preview today. I said, 'you have to break all the ground you can because you might make a groundbreaking discovery.'\nTrinen:[Laughs] That's right. So for us, the number one thing that I think is probably just the most satisfying about this game is just DK the character. He's back, he's back in a big way. And DK is a character within the pantheon of Nintendo characters who has always been a bit on the more powerful side, wild at times, silly.\nAnd all of that has just been thoroughly baked into this game. And as the character DK, you're able to use the power of his punches and you might attack an enemy in the environment, and that enemy goes flying and hits a wall and the wall crumbles and you see something there, and that then entices you to go in and start digging through the terrain to see what else you can find back there. And it just creates this incredibly rewarding cycle of destruction and discovery that is woven all throughout the game.\nIGN:The discovery via destruction was a really cool cornerstone of this game from my time with it. I thought that was just really great. And the second that I started playing it, I just felt the DNA ofSuper Mario Odysseyand Mr. [Yoshiaki] Koizumi's team all over this in so many ways. Are they the ones that are working on this?\nTrinen:It's a very good question. You'll have to stay tuned. We always like to start by showcasing the game and getting people focused on the gameplay, but we'll have some information to share about the developer in due time.\nIGN:Okay. Can you tell me, is this internally developed? Because there hasn't been an internal Donkey Kong game since I believe Jungle Beat was the last one?\nTrinen:Jungle Beat was the last one.\nIGN:You had the NST (Nintendo Software Technology) do the Mario vs. Donkey Kongs, but...\nTrinen:NST has done the Mario vs. Donkey Kong games, but this is going to be a fun one.\nIGN:So nothing more on that?\nTrinen:Nothing more on that yet.\nIGN:Okay. I had to try. Let's talk about Mario Kart World, because there's so much great stuff in there, but I thinkthe cow is what's stealing everybody's heart. Did you expect that reaction? There's Akira memes about the cow, it's hilarious out there. Did you know the cow was going to be a big star?\nTrinen:I would say perhaps not as big as the cow has become. Internally, certainly the very first moment that we saw the cow, everybody wanted to play as Cow.\nIGN:When we were playing Knockout Tour yesterday, there were just like seven cows on the track.\nTrinen:Well, that's the other thing that I just love about Mario Kart World is with the interconnected world of tracks, as I'm driving, you'll start something like Knockout Tour and you'll be driving across the continent. And what used to be the Mario Kart model was there's discrete tracks and you race on a discrete track and then you choose a different track and you race on a different discrete track.\nAnd now what I find is I'm driving through, I'm starting in a new track and driving across the terrain and, 'Oh, I just happened to pass through Moo Moo Meadows and now I'm onto the next thing.' And it's just like for somebody that's grown up playing Mario Kart for so many years, just to be able to have that experience and piece it all together mentally into this big massive continent of racing has been a whole lot of fun for me.\nIGN:It feels like a theme park of Mario Kart history, and I'm driving yesterday and going through all the different segments and then all of a sudden, 'Oh, I'm in the geyser tunnel from Dino Dino Jungle from Double Dash.' But I'm wondering, so right now it seems like the races, you start at one track and end up at another, and then the final lap is one loop around that final circuit you end up at. Not in the Knockout Tour, that's different, but is there a time trial or versus race mode that’s a way to just do three laps at this track? Or are you always driving interconnected between them when you're racing?\nTrinen:You will have abilities to drive three laps on certain tracks. Obviously we've got a Nintendo Direct dedicated to Mario Kart World coming. I think you'll see a lot more on the game there, and I think a lot more that will hopefully surprise you and make you really feel like, 'Wow, there's a lot to this game.'\nIGN:That will be really good to see. Because right now it looks great, it plays great, but I think the talk of the town is the price tag. This is an $80 game from Nintendo in the United States and $50 if you buy the Nintendo Switch 2 bundle. But I saw somewhere on your website that that bundle is only available for a limited time while supplies last. Can you just talk about the strategy behind pricing Mario Kart World this way?\nTrinen:Well, I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value? Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, but I did read your article this morning and I think you had mentioned that you didn’t find a lot to discover when roaming around. So I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out about that.\nBut honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.\nIGN:Okay. And to just stay on pricing for a little bit here.I'm looking at the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of games and some games are $70, some are $80. That's what it's looking like right now. And some are cheaper than that too. I don't think we know the U.S. price for the Welcome Tour yet, but I think we saw the Japanese price is around $10.\nTrinen:Yeah, the U.S. price is $9.99 for the Welcome Tour.\nIGN:$9.99. Okay, digital only.\nTrinen:Yes.\nIGN:I'm just wondering about the strategy behind pricing these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions at the combination of the Switch 1 retail price, usually $59.99, and then whatever that upgrade path is, like $10 for Breath of the Wild, making that a $70 game, or Tears of the Kingdom is an $80 game because it's $70 plus the $10 upgrade path. Can you just walk me through the strategy behind not offering any sort of discount for newcomers on Switch 2 and saying, 'Tears of the Kingdom is $80 now just like Mario Kart is?'\nTrinen:Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?' What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you're looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that's the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game.\nFor somebody who has bought Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the Zelda upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership. So there's no additional charge for those. But I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that.\nIGN:Okay, thanks. And then the pricing for the console itself, too. A lot of people are talking about it — $450 in the United States, and we know there are definitely global economic factors at play. Can you share anything behind the strategy for pricing of the console? Was this something that was up to the wire where you didn't know what it was going to cost until recently? Can you share any insight?\nTrinen:Can't really share insight into any of that. Obviously the cost of everything goes up over time, and I personally would love if the cost of things didn't go up over time. But I think any time you're building a new system that's got new features and new tech, there's costs associated with that. So again, we look at what is the experience on Nintendo Switch? What's the experience on Nintendo Switch 2? What are the new features that it offers? And certainly there's the cost of goods and things that factor into that, but we try to find the right appropriate price for a product based on that.\nIGN:Last question on price, I promise. I played Welcome Tour on the show floor and I walked away and thought, 'this is a perfect pack-in game.' It shows what the console is, it shows HDR, it shows these new technologies Nintendo is embracing — in some cases for the first time — and I feel like it's a great showcase for the console. Was there ever any talk of making this a pack-in game, and why did you make the decision to price it as a separate digital product?\nTrinen:It's an interesting product. We're actually getting ready today, we're going to be doing someNintendo Treehouse Live segmentsand covering a lot of games in detail. That's one of them. And I think people will be able to see through Treehouse Live probably a little bit more maybe than you were able to see on the show floor. It's a pretty robust piece of software. There's a lot of great detail in there.\nFor some people, I think there are people who are particularly interested in the tech and the specs of the system and things like that, for them I think it's going to be a great product. It's really for people that want more information about the system rather than necessarily a quick intro to everything it does. And for that reason and just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, 'Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you're getting out of the product.'\nIGN:Okay. I want to talk about some of the features of the Joy-Con 2 now because I was really impressed with the mouse functionality. I thought that it worked really, really well in something like Metroid Prime 4. I can see that being the preferred way for a lot of people to play that game. So what are your expectations for mouse controls? Are you hoping that third-party developers make great use of them? Do you think it can bring new types of games? Just talk to me about your feelings about the mouse.\nTrinen:Well, personally, I'm really excited about the mouse control. I don't know what your experience with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was, the way that to me is probably my favorite way to play is I like to play split Joy-Con. I just like the freedom of having my hands not locked onto a controller like that. So I often like to play split Joy-Con and having the freedom to just seamlessly drop the mouse down for combat and then pick it back up for split Joy-Con, to me is something, number one, you can't do with any other console, you can't do on PC.\nAnd it makes for a really great experience for the Prime series, particularly because the Prime series is the creator of the first-person adventure genre. And so in a series where you're doing a lot of exploration that's got some combat mixed in with it, that freedom feels right. Because for me, I feel like if I'm doing a lot of exploration, I want to be split Joy-Con. That flexibility to me is amazing.\nI think the other thing that probably I'm hoping people are catching onto is that, yes, the Joy-Con 2 introduced mouse control, but they introduce mouse control in conjunction with the other technology within the Joy-Con. So whereas with a PC mouse, you're moving up and down and side to side and whatnot, with the Joy-Con, you've got the added ability to apply things like the angle that you're twisting the Joy-Con at, and having that also impact the play control with the mouse.\nOr you've got two Joy-Con that have mouse control each, and that means two things. It means either you can have immediate two-player mouse control gameplay right out of the box with the Nintendo Switch 2, or it means, as we see withDrag x Drive, that you can do things with dual Joy-Con control, which hasn't been done before. And so my hope is really threefold. One, is that our own development teams continue to experiment with what they can do with the mouse to create creative new ways to use it.\nI hope that we start to see third-parties that are then looking at opportunities with things like dual mouse control or combination of mouse plus motion control to evolve their gameplay. But I also do hope that when you look at PC developers, for example, if they want to bring a PC-based game to console, they have to spend a lot of time revamping the control scheme and adapting it to button controls. And so having the freedom of mouse control with the Joy-Con hopefully makes PC developers a lot more eager to want to bring their games to Nintendo Switch 2.\nIGN:Well, my social team really wants to know. We don't have Switch 2 cartridges here. Do they taste like Switch 1 cartridges?\nTrinen:[Laughs] I don't know yet.\nIGN:You haven't done a taste test?\nTrinen:I have not done a taste test. I keep hoping for pistachio flavor, but that's not happening.\nIGN:[Laughs] I don't think that would turn away the kids. Okay, cool. Well, my last question here is that Kirby Air Riders was a huge surprise at the Nintendo Direct yesterday. And to see that is this secret project thatMr. [Masahiro] Sakurai teased earlier this year after wrapping up his YouTube series. Cool to see him come back to work with you guys again. Can you share any details further than that teaser we got in the Direct?\nTrinen:Well, I believe Mr. Sakurai has said that there will not be any additional information on the game for quite a while. The team's working very hard on it. But for me, this was probably one of the most exciting announcements for a couple of reasons.\nOne, I'm always excited to see what Sakurai-san is working on. Two, he created the Kirby character and the Kirby franchise. And so it's great to see him come back to lead and direct a Kirby game again for the first time in a couple of decades. But I think more importantly, I've always felt that Kirby Air Ride on GameCube was a game that was ahead of its time and maybe not fully understood at the time that it came out.\nAnd so I'm just really excited because there's a core group of people that played that game on GameCube that love it to death. And number one, I'm just happy because for them, this is such a big announcement and it's so good to see their excitement. But at the same time, I think that with where we are in the game industry today, I think we've got a real opportunity to introduce a much bigger audience to Kirby Air Riders. And I think people will finally really begin to appreciate just what I think is the genius of Masahiro Sakurai and what he created with that game.\nIGN:Well, I'm in that core group. It's like one of my big childhood games. I love Kirby Air Ride, City Trial Free Roam. That's all I was doing, so I'm very excited. But thanks so much, Bill. We're super excited for June 5 and everything else that's coming on the way.\nTrinen:Great. Thank you.\nLogan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager & Playlist Editor.

    "full_text": "Just a few months after theAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3Dgraced us with its presence, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D brings its 3D V-Cache technology to a 16-core, 32-threadgaming processorthat’s absolutely overkill for most people, but will have no problem keeping up with powerfulgraphics cardslike theNvidia RTX 5090or whatever comes next.\n\nHowever, all of those cores come with a high $699 asking price and a 170W power budget, making this processor hard to recommend to anyone who isn’t already building an incredibly powerful (and expensive) gaming PC. For anyone else, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D just makes more sense.\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D is available March 12, starting at $699. This is a suggested price, and AMD's processors have been known to fluctuate in value depending on demand.\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D essentially takes the same Zen 5 cores behind the regular9950Xand pairs them with the new 2nd-generation 3D V-Cache found in the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. That means you still get excellent multi-core performance, but paired with better gaming performance thanks to a more capacious cache.\nUnlike the Ryzen 9 7950X3D that preceded it, though, the 3D V-Cache is now physically located below the actual CPU cores, rather than above them. This seems like a minor change, to be sure, but it ends up making a major difference in thermal performance. Because the CCD, or Core Complex Die, is what produces most of the CPU’s heat, having it closer to the Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS), means it’s able to dissipate heat more easily. And with AMD’s performance algorithm taking thermal headroom into account, those lower temperatures mean the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is able to run faster, longer.\nThe physical location of the cache is about more than just temperatures, though. Because it’s directly under the CPU cores, there is less distance for the data to travel, which cuts down on latency. Plus, because the cache gets more space, AMD was able to shove in a ton of it, with the 9950X3D having 144MB of combined L2 and L3 cache. That’s the same amount as in the last-generation Ryzen 9 7950X3D, but it’s still much more than you’re going to find in any non-X3D processor.\nBoth the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and 9950X3D have the same 170W TDP, though the original 9950X has a higher potential PPT. Though, in my testing, I found that both processors ended up peaking at 200W. Though, the 9950X3D did have a lower peak temperature, only reaching 79°C during the test suite – though it was tested on a different cooler than the original 9950X.\nLuckily, because the 9950X3D isn’t using a new chipset, it's compatible with any AM5 AMD motherboard. AMD has come out and said it would support this socket until at least 2027, so you won’t have to worry about getting locked into a dead platform.\nBefore I dive into performance results, I have to note that all CPUs were tested on the same hardware, with one exception: the Ryzen 9 9950X. That was tested on an Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero motherboard with a Corsair H170i 360mm AIO cooler. This difference in hardware will have an impact on performance, but it’s not likely to be a major difference, especially since everything is tested at stock settings.\nThis happened largely because one of the mounting screws for the Asus ROG Ryujin III 360mm cooler I was using snapped when swapping to the 9950X. I will retest the processors in the coming weeks, and if anything is significantly different I’ll be sure to update this section.\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D is a 16-core, 32-thread gaming processor with an absolutely ridiculous 144MB of cache, so it shouldn’t be too surprising that it’s incredibly powerful. Even in creative benchmarks, where the 9800X3D fell behind, the 9950X3D has no problem keeping up with the most powerful chips on the market.\nWhat’s surprising is how well the 9950X3D holds up against 9800X3D in single-core workloads. For example, in Cinebench 1T, the 9950X3D gets 2,254 points, compared to 2,033 points, making for a 10% improvement. Then, in the 3DMark CPU Profile test, the 9950X3D scores 1,280 points, which comes in striking distance to the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K’s 1,351 points.\nOf course, in multi-threaded workloads, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is really able to stretch its legs, scoring 40,747 points in Cinebench’s multi-core test. Just like the 9800X3D, the 9950X3D does lose some top-end performance in multi-threaded applications, falling short of the 41,123 points from the 9950X and 42,245 points from the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, but it's worth it for the boost in gaming performance.\nIn Total War: Warhammer 3 at 1080p with Ultra settings, the 9950X3D is able to get 274 fps when paired with the RTX 4090. Compared to 254 fps from the 9800X3D and 255 from the Core Ultra 9 285K, the 9950X3D easily takes the crown here. However, in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with the Ultra preset and ray tracing disabled, the 9950X3D delivers 229 fps, down from 240 fps from the 9800X3D. That’s a disappointing result, but it’s still way faster than the 165 fps from the competing Intel processor.\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D might be the most powerful gaming processor on the market right now, but that doesn’t mean it has a de facto lead on every other chip on the market. Most people will have no problem getting by with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which just so happens to be much much more affordable at $479.\nInstead, the 9950X3D is geared towards gamers that both play games and use creative apps like Photoshop and Premiere, the latter of which sees a 15% performance improvement over the 9800X3D. For a pure gaming PC build, though, you’re probably better off saving that extra $220 for a better graphics card.\nJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen. You can follow her@Jackiecobra\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D is an incredibly powerful gaming processor. It takes the 3D V-Cache that made the 9800X3D so good and shoves it in a processor with twice as many cores. This doesn’t do too much to boost gaming performance, but it makes the 9950X3D a much more flexible processor for anyone that likes to both work and play on their PC."

    "full_text": "Star Wars Hunterspublisher Zynga has announced plans for the game to shut down entirely just nine months after it was released, and it appears plans to launch a PC version of Steam are scrapped.\n\nThe NaturalMotion-developed, free-to-download team-based battle arena game launched on Nintendo Switch and iOS and Android in June 2024. IGN’sStar Wars: Hunters reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Star Wars: Hunters’ lighthearted PvP fun is like a party at the Death Star: Impressive for a bit, but probably not a place you’ll want to hang around for too long.”\nIt seems the review was prescient, asZynga announcedthat “after careful consideration” it had decided the final content update for Star Wars: Hunters across all platforms would be released on April 15, with the game remaining playable until October 1, 2025.\n“We understand this news may be disappointing and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly,” Zynga continued. “Your passion and dedication to the game and its community have meant the world to us, and we are committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process.”\nHere are the logistics: on March 25, Season 5 will be extended by three weeks. Zynga will re-run events and shop bundles from the Season, and the Ranked Season will also be extended, giving players more time to hit Kyber 1 rank.\nOn April 15, the game’s final content update will be released for free and in-game purchases will be disabled across all platforms. New Support Hunter, Tuya, will join the game as part of the final update. Tuya will be available and playable for all users immediately at no cost, along with a slate of additional in-game content. Zynga will continue to run a final Ranked Mode leaderboard for players to compete in and run all battlefields and game modes in rotation.\nAnd then, on October 1, online servers will officially shut down, and Star Wars: Hunters will no longer be playable beyond this point.\nThere’s no mention of the PC version,which was announced to launch on Steam in early access form this year, in the shutdown notice. Its Steam page now includes a notice that the game is “no longer available on the Steam store.”\nTake-Two-owned Zynga is best known for mobile games FarmVille, Words with Friends, and CSR Racing, but with Star Wars: Hunters it branched out to console for the first time. Similarly, Star Wars: Hunters was meant to be the first Zynga-published game to launch on PC.\n“The success of Star Wars: Hunters on mobile and Nintendo Switch devices has led to our decision to expand the game to PC,” said Yaron Leyvan, executive vice president, games, at Zynga, back in November.\n“This is something our community of fans have been asking for and we are very excited to welcome even more players to Vespaara. This moment also marks a milestone for Zynga as we bring one of our games to PC for the first time.”\nThere are still a number of Star Wars video games in the works, including Respawn Entertainment's third Star Wars Jedi game andBit Reactor's turn-based tactics game set to be revealed at Star Wars Celebration 2025.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "title": "Logitech G Pro X TKL Rapid Gaming Keyboard Review",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-31T18:27:52Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/logitech-g-pro-x-tkl-rapid-gaming-keyboard-review",
    "full_text": "Logitech is entering a new generation of its Pro series product line of PC peripherals, which focuses on high-performance gaming. With the Pro X TKL Rapid, we have a tenkeyless keyboard chock-full of fresh features centered around a magnetic switch technology that’s new for Logitech, wedging itself among some of thebest gaming keyboardsavailable today. This comes with intricately adjustable functionality and robust RGB customization Logitech users have become accustomed to. After putting it through its paces, the Pro X TKL Rapid proves to be an impressive piece of gear that abandons most flashy aesthetics in favor of letting the keys be the star of the show.\n\nAt first glance, the TKL Rapid looks like any other Logitech G series keyboard. It’s a simple black rectangle with thin bezels with RGB lights shining through each key. Hovering atop the standard layout are a series of media keys and a large volume control wheel on the top right, which is quite nice to use. Because of its tenkeyless design, the TKL Rapid has a mercifully small footprint – for a keyboard focused on performance, I appreciate how much it doesn’t get in the way of whatever else is happening on my desk.\nIts visible parts don’t stand out on the black colorway, which is the model I’ve been testing. For those who want a little more visual pizazz, it comes in white or pink variants as well. The keys are made of recycled ABS plastic, as is the frame, with a solid aluminum slab supporting the keyboard’s frame. There are certainly better quality and more stylish keycaps out there, but what comes stock is comfortable enough, if not completely unremarkable in feel – at least it doesn’t stand out for any bad reasons. The keys are stable on the switches, with no wiggle that I’ve noticed on the keycaps. Of course, these are parts keyboard enthusiasts can swap out, and the TKL Rapid is compatible with third-party keycaps if you want to make it more unique.\nThe TKL Rapid’s special sauce is under the caps in the debuting magnetic analog switches and it’s further enhanced by the level of customization within Logitech’s robust G Hub app. The move from mechanical to analog switches to make gaming better isn’t just a marketing move; it really can make a difference (as is the case in themany Hall Effect gaming keyboards we’ve reviewedrecently). Instead of having a set actuation point built into a mechanism, analog switches can be adjusted via software and set the actuation point of each key, letting it recognize inputs at varying travel distances without having to swap out the switch. Even better, it can be changed on each individual key, allowing for incredible personalization.\nStraight out of the box, my first hours using the keyboard were troubling, but once I dialed in the right settings, the experience came together nicely. On default settings, I was initially consistently mistyping, chalking it up to getting used to the device. After a lengthy session of using the keyboard, it simply didn’t feel quite right. That’s until I installed G Hub and started messing around with the actuation point of my keys. By default, the Pro X TKL Rapid is set to a 2.0mm actuation, which was a little too shallow for my typing style, especially considering the keyboard’s superlight 35g actuation force. Luckily, this can be shifted anywhere between the extremely light touch of 0.1mm to almost the complete depth of the key press at 4.0mm. Once I dialed in around 3.0mm, it was a revelation, and I started enjoying the keyboard a whole lot more.\nIt’s notable that while we are dealing with magnetic technology, adjusting the actuation point doesn’t change the pressure needed to press a key, which doesn’t take much, considering the TKL Rapid is made with competitive gaming in mind. Rather, it reads magnetic fields within the switch as the key travels and triggers at whatever distance is set for that key in G Hub. Logitech isn’t a pioneer with these switches, andHall Effect is gradually becoming the standardin high-end keyboards, but they’re utilized very well in this model and helped open my mind on what’s possible with a gaming keyboard.\nComplementing the adjustable actuation points is Rapid Trigger, a feature that affects how far upward the key needs to ascend before it is considered to be released. If you use it,  the key doesn’t have to return to its default position to reset, which has had promising results while playing games. Testing the feature with Diablo IV, I was undoubtedly unleashing my abilities faster, setting the Rapid Trigger to reset at 0.5mm, with a range of 0.1mm to 2.0mm to play with. It certainly makes a difference in fast-paced games where a critically-timed button press is of the utmost importance.\nCheck out our roundup of thebest gaming mice!\nNot only can you globally set the actuation points and Rapid Trigger for the entire keyboard, but each key can be adjusted individually for both features and save profiles to be loaded for specific games when they launch. Your Overwatch 2 setting preferences are bound to be different from League of Legends or Path of Exile, and I absolutely love how I can fine-tune the TKL Rapid for each game in mind.\nBecause there are a lot of complications with every key potentially having different activation and release points, the TKL Rapid includes a Key Priority setting. With this tool, I was able to pair two keys that may be pressed around the same time, like my Mage’s spells on the number row in World of Warcraft, and determine which one is more important to be the one that is accepted at that moment. There are varying options like Key Travel Priority, which chooses the key that’s pressed furthest, or Absolute Priority, which will, well, choose which one key will absolutely work instead of the other. As someone who sometimes fumbles my spells in tense situations, it certainly helped clean up my casting rotation during dungeons and eliminate mistakes.\nBut really, this is Logitech's version of SOCD input, or simultaneous opposite cardinal direction, which is a contentious feature in competitive gaming. In a shooter, this lets you counter-strafe (or jiggle strafe) without interuption which would be impossible otherwise, making you a much harder target. You can, and will, get kicked from Counter-Strike 2 matches, for example. (We found out the hard way when reviewing theRazer BlackWidow V4 Pro 75.) If you use this feature, just be mindful of the context in which you use it in.\nWhile it’s not the typical use case for a keyboard like this, during my time with the Pro X TKL Rapid, I took it with me on a road trip, and it traveled surprisingly well. Due to its tenkeyless design, its narrower frame fits wonderfully in my backpack. Paired with its removable USB-C cable that’s slim enough to slip into an available pocket, I didn’t have to worry about sacrificing critical space next to or around the keyboard. The keys are still full-sized, so there’s still a consideration of how far they protrude, but I’m happy to report it’s not at all farfetched to take the TKL Rapid on the go.\nOf course, being a premium product, Logitech’s usual suite of features applies to the TKL Rapid. It features full RGB lighting on every key, which can be adjusted per key in G Hub. It hits just about every color in the rainbow except a clean white and some shades of purple, which both end up more blue than anything, which is slightly disappointing.\nGame Mode is also available, with a physical button above the first section of F keys, which disables buttons like the Windows and menu keys, which can interrupt heated matches if pressed by mistake. In addition, it provides the option to choose which other keys you’d like to wipe the functionality off, leaving only your critical keys active while Game Mode is engaged. Along with key mapping and more layout profiles to flip through with G-Shift, the TKL Pro is endlessly customizable for whatever game you want to adapt to.\nThe Logitech G Pro X TKL Rapid is available for $169.99 from retailers such asAmazonordirectly from the Logitech. While we received the black color scheme for review, it also comes inbright magentaandall-white colorway.\nThe more you tweak the Logitech G Pro X TKL Rapid, the more you’ll get from this remarkable keyboard. Its level of customization is staggering, and there’s a lot of nuance in tweaking it for each game I’m playing, but it also makes it feel stellar as my everyday typing tool. While the cost of entry is steep for a rather basic-looking keyboard – even if it’s relatively close to its competitors at a retail price of $170 – the TKL Rapid is worth it for all the bells and whistles made possible by the switch to magnetic analog switches. It’s a new standard for dedicated PC gamers, but it also succeeds for those looking for an exceptional and reliable compact keyboard."

However, for gamers with an older graphics card who want a significant performance boost, the RTX 5080 absolutely provides – doubly so if you’re comfortable with Nvidia’s AI goodies.\"\nCheck out more of thebest Alienware deals.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

Enjoy the experience, share your thoughts, and help shape the future of AI-powered gameplay experiences.\n\"This bite-sized demo pulls you into an interactive space inspired by Quake II, where AI crafts immersive visuals and responsive action on the fly. It’s a groundbreaking glimpse at a brand new way of interacting with games, turning cutting-edge research into a quick and compelling playable demo.\"\nAll thatsoundspretty impressive, but the demo itself is... well, less so.\nAfter The Game Awards boss Geoff Keighley shared a brief video of the demo in actionon X / Twitter,hundreds of people responded, with few having anything positive to say.\nMicrosoft has created an AI-generated replica of Quake II that you can play in browser.\"Every frame is created on the fly by an AI world model.\"Play it here:https://t.co/WGQymDOmsjpic.twitter.com/35MX5aHPbF\n\"Man, I don't want the future of games to be AI-generated slop,\" said oneRedditor. \"There will be a point where it will be easier to use AI, and then all the greedy studios will do it exclusively. The human element will be removed.\n\"And the worst part is gamers will buy it. They buy skins for 100 dollars. They will buy whatever you sell them.\"\n\"Microsoft's boast that they want 'to build a whole catalog of games that use this new AI model,' despite it not being clear if the current technique will ever even be capable of letting you turn around without moving to a random point on the map let alone come up with an original game, really typifies what's wrong with AI and the tech industry,\"addedanother.\n\"I had a better experience literally just imagining the game in my head,\"saidanother commenter.\nNot everyone was so quick to dismiss it, however.\n\"I don't know why everything has to be doom and gloom,\"saida more cheery respondent. \"It's a demo for a reason. It shows the future possibilities. Having an AI that is able to create a coherent and consistent world is crazy. But this cannot be used to create a full game or anything enjoyable. You cannot play this. Seems like a tool for early concept/pitching phase. This can also bring improvement in other fields in AI as what it is doing is impressive.\n\"This is not even a product yet but a demo showing how much they've improved from just a few months ago.\"\nEpic Games boss Tim Sweeney had a rather different response:\npic.twitter.com/XidCvhLDTI\nGenerative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI.The game failed, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”\nStill, that hasn’t put off a number of video game companies from using generative AI in the development of their products.Activision recently disclosed the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assetsas part of new requirements on Steam, amid a backlash to an \"AI slop\" zombie Santa loading screen.\nAnd last month,Horizon actor Ashly Burch addressed a controversial AI Aloy video that leaked online, using it to call attention to the demands of striking voice actors.\nVikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

    "full_text": "Bloodborneturns 10 years old today, and fans are celebrating by organizing yet another return to Yharnam community event.\n\nFromSoftware’s PlayStation 4 masterpiece launched on March 24, 2015, and helped cement the Japanese developer as one of the greatest of our time. Critical and commercial acclaim followed, and a follow-up in the vein of the Dark Souls sequels seemed inevitable.\nBut since then… nothing. Why hasn’t Sony followed upBloodbornewith either a current-gen remaster, a full-on sequel, or at the very least a next-gen update that would finally make it officially playable in 60fps? Fans have begged Sony for more Bloodborne ever since it came out. The deafening silence in response remains one of the most puzzling business decisions in all video games.\nEarlier this year, we got an explanation of sorts. Following his exit from Sony,PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida revealed his Bloodborne no-show theory. To be clear up front: this is Yoshida’s opinion, which inan interview with Kinda Funny Gameshe stressed was not inside information, or the reveal of the current deliberations within the bowels of Sony itself.\n“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida said. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.\n“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”\nMiyazaki-san is of course Hidetaka Miyazaki, the boss of FromSoftware. And yes, he’s incredibly successful. Not only for the influential Dark Souls series, but, most recently, the mainstream hitElden Ring, which propelled FromSoftware to new heights. So much so thatit’s getting a multiplayer spin-off this year.\nAnd it seems obvious to say Miyazaki will be incredibly busy with multiple projects to direct and a company to run. After Bloodborne came out in 2015, Miyazaki directedDark Souls 3, then 2019’sSekiro: Shadows Die Twicefor Activision, then the aforementioned Elden Ring for Bandai Namco. What's next? Miyazaki has yet to say.\nIn interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year,Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware.\nIn the years since, modders have tried to fill the gaps with fan-made projects that improve upon the base PS4 Bloodborne experience. But Sony has taken a dim view.Well-known Bloodborne 60fps mod creator Lance McDonald announced in Januarythat he’d received a takedown notification on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment “asking that I remove links to the patch I posted on the internet, so I've now done so.” The DMCA takedown arrived four years after the mod was released.\nThen, just a week later, Lilith Walther,creator ofNightmare Kart, which was previously known asBloodborne Kart, and the eye-catching Bloodborne PSX demake, tweeted to say an old YouTube video of the demake was hit with a copyright claim.\nRecently, fans managed to get PS4 emulators to deliver something akin to a remaster on PC. The tech experts atDigital Foundry released a videocovering “a breakthrough in PS4 emulation” via ShadPS4, which means Bloodborne is now fully playable start to finish in 60fps. Could this breakthrough have triggered an aggressive response from Sony? IGN asked Sony for comment at the time, but it has yet to respond.\nThat’s all we have to go on, really, which leaves Bloodborne fans to take it upon themselves to organize Return to Yharnam community events.Another kicks off today, on Bloodborne’s 10th anniversary, and calls on fans to create a new character, and summon as many random cooperators and invaders as possible, and leave in-game messages flagging they’re a part of this latest community drive.\nPerhaps this will be all that’s left for fans to do in the world of Bloodborne forever more.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "title": "How Assassin's Creed Shadows Makes the Most of Its “Boring” Setting",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-19T13:30:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/how-assassins-creed-shadows-makes-the-most-of-its-boring-setting",
    "full_text": "In 2012, Assassin’s Creed 3 director Alex Hutchinson called out people on the internet for suggesting the most “boring” future settings for the series. “The three most wanted [settings for Assassin’s Creed] are WWII, feudal Japan and Egypt,” he explained at the time, adding “They’re kind of the three worst settings for an AC game.” Hutchinson later clarified his statement, saying “the point I was trying to make was that in the broad strokes and scale of history, that’s a theme that’s been well-mined in video games.” He’s not wrong and since he made his most recent comments, Ghost of Tsushima, Rise of the Ronin, Nioh and more have all shone a spotlight on feudal Japan.\n\nFast-forward to 2025 and Assassin’s Creed is finally going to one of these “worst” settings with Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, but Shadows director Jonathan Dumont believes his team has found a new way to tell the story of feudal Japan.\n\"I think it's not boring at all. The setting is very exciting,\" Dumont says when asked about Hutchinson’s quote. \"I do think that being able to bring it to life and have that balance of the political intrigue [of the era], the war and conflict, and also the beauty of nature and supporting more exploration within this changing world give it another dimension [compared to other games].\"\nHutchinson wasn’t wrong back in 2012. The setting of Feudal Japan has indeed been one of the most requested locations for the Assassin's Creed series. Bringing the series' unique blend of historical fiction and sci-fi to the backdrop of warring states and samurai in fierce conflict seemed like a no-brainer for developer Ubisoft to make happen sooner rather than later. The only problem was Ubisoft chose later, perhaps to its detriment.\nThough Ubisoft has been praised for exploring previously overlooked historical settings like Egypt and Industrial Revolution England, other developers have beaten Ubisoft to open-world stealth-action games set in Japan with titles like Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Tsushima. That said, shows like FX’s Shogun prove that people’s appetites for samurai action hasn’t waned in the least. Much like Shogun, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows explores how outsiders navigate the courts and politics of feudal Japan. And the Assassin’s Creed name has a built-in reputation all on its own.\nDumont highlights the conflict and historical impact of the era – particularly in how Japan was \"opened up\" to the rest of the world for the first time following the arrival of Portuguese merchants and missionaries during the late 1500s Sengoku era.\n\"What made the setting interesting for us to tackle was the political landscape of the time, along with the arts and the environment of that era. We've seen other games do it before, but not in the Assassin's Creed way that we're doing it,\" says Dumont. \"We also have that big open-world feeling with the big cities, the wilderness, and we really touch upon the historical arts and the reconstruction of these locations to make it real for that time. So I don't think we've seen that necessarily in a lot of games [covering this era] – to truly explore and bring you into that world.”\nAccording to Dumont, the political intrigue of the era made it a particularly compelling setting to tackle for Assassin's Creed. A key difference he highlights that makes Shadows different from other games is how it brings a more dynamic and deeper dive into a politically troubled era filled with conflict – one that players will be able to immerse themselves in and learn more about almost from the moment the game begins.\nThere is also the matter of new technology that Ubisoft utilized in order to bring its version of Japan to life.\n\"The team was very enthusiastic about Assassin's Creed's take on Feudal Japan, and we felt that the latest technological improvements and new consoles would help us bring that vision to life,\" says Dumont. He highlights the dynamic weather and seamless open-world, and according to our review, the team seemingly succeeded in creating one of the best historical locations in Assassin’s Creed history.\nRemember, the Assassin’s Creed series began during the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 era, and since then technology has come a long way, with 4K resolution, bigger open worlds with greater density, and ray-tracing now standard on consoles and PC.\n\"What that does is give a much more 'alive' feeling than what we've done in the past [with other games],\" he continues. \"So I think that technology that took a few years to develop is omnipresent and all around you within the game. It does bring another dimension of being able to see the world in different states – which gives it more depth. It would not have been possible to make Shadows without our current technology; I don't think we would have gotten that feeling of losing ourselves in this open world without it.\"\nWhat makes the Assassin's Creed series so compelling is how it takes historical settings and injects its patented stealth-action gameplay and open-world immersion to make them all the more engrossing. Assassin's Creed Shadows leans into the samurai and ninja fantasy, much like other games tackling this setting. And the need to one-up the competition presented a big challenge to ensure the game's scope was well realized – and given the lengthy wait for the series to tackle a Japan setting, Dumont felt the wait was worth it.\n“It's really all about keeping the vision there, and the team keeps pushing for better quality in every aspect,” he says. “There's always a challenge with trying to meet people's expectations, and we also put the pressure on ourselves to do the best we can.\"\nFor more on Assassin's Creed Shadows, check outIGN's review of the game.\n"

    "full_text": "Moza’s R3 PC Wheel and Pedals bundle is a competitively priced and compelling pit stop for any newcomer looking to dip a leaden foot into simming. Also, it’s an ideal, ready-to-race package that will rev the engines of anybody who dreams less of shaving PBs on a track and more about shredding POS cars in Wreckfest 2.\n\nBetter than that, though, it’s just big gobs of fun with physics a-go-go and punchy force feedback aplenty.\nWhile the 3.9Nm thrumming in this wheelbase doesn’t exactly redline with its peak power, it’s still a solid and stylish DD unit that hums along like a finely tuned machine. Unlike its clunkier, noisier gear-and-belt-driven rivals at the entry level, the R3 is whisper-quiet and ridiculously compact in comparison. Better yet, the bundle is extremely mod-friendly, so upgrading your ride down the road is a cinch—no need to swap out the whole chassis.\nThe Moza R3 Racing Wheel and Pedals bundle is a full-throttle, plug-and-play racing system. Inside the box, you’ll find Moza’s new 3.9 Nm R3 wheelbase, a 280mm PC-compatible steering wheel, a set of SR-P Lite pedals, and a separate table clamp is also included. Believe you me, you’re going to need that last bit of kit once the FFB gets going. Nothing jerry-rigged or half-arsed is going to hold this sucker down when the cars start cartwheeling.\nSaid clamp is made entirely of steel and is rigid as hell—quite sturdier than the plastic alternatives, and it has a generous 50mm of clamp space. Via the chaos of Wreckfest 2, I certainly gave that rigidity a run for its money. Thanks to a beefy desk and a straightforward system of four mount holes to secure the R3 wheelbase, this setup holds up well under the stresses of force feedback.\nWeighing in at just 2.29 kilos and measuring a compact 120mm high, 135mm wide, and only 93mm long (excluding the steering shaft), the R3 is a pocket rocket of a wheelbase. Its boxy, industrial design gives it a serious motorsport aesthetic—far more race-ready-looking than some of the older, plastic clamshells that are out there competing.\nThe Moza R3 Racing Wheel and Pedals bundle is available fromPagnian ImportsandJB Hi-Fifor $549.95.\nI also like that the ports on the back are neatly arranged for easy access, with slots for pedals, a dash display, a shifter, a handbrake, and even an emergency stop device. Out of the box, the only one you’ll need is the pedal port, but expansion is as easy as adding aftermarket mods to a project car. There are also two threaded holes up top for mounting Moza’s dash display.\nWheel-wise, the one you’re getting default here is a comfy D-shape affair with a grippy polyurethane wrapping. I like the feel of the clicky, short-throw paddle shifters that are crafted from sturdy black metal. And I dig that Moza allows for some customisation here—the brushed metal wheel rim is removable, and alternative rims are available to better serve your race discipline of choice.\nHeading below the equator, we have the R3’s pedal set, which is only an accelerator and a brake. If you’re searching for a clutch experience—and that’d make perfect sense for OG muscle cars in Wreckfest 2—you can make an extra pit lane purchase of a third pedal. Prices seem to be reasonable for that, and I know from experience that Moza’s ecosystem is all about easy installation.\nBeyond that, these metal pedals feel a heck of a lot more robust than some of the plastic-heavy alternatives on the market. Resistance comes from springs rather than a load cell, so while they’re not championship-grade, they should be more than enough for entry-level sim racers. There’s also a surprising degree of adjustability, with pedal pads that can be repositioned higher or lower, and the entire pedal units can be moved left or right.\nWith 3.9 Nm of peak torque, the R3 isn’t exactly a torque monster, but it’s right in the slipstream of other entry-level contenders with similar price pricepoints. It’s also perfect for some low-stakes, throw-around fun in a physics-heavy (yet nonetheless arcade-y) title like Wreckfest 2.I’m not going to lie to you, though; I did need to do some tinkering to make Wreckfest 2 speak correctly with the R3, at least initially. However, thanks to the ever-changing landscape of Early Access, a few hotfixes meant I no longer had to constantly rebind/reverse my pedals in Moza’s (usually quite capable) Pit House software. Everything works pretty much as it should now, and, obviously, support will only get better as yet more fixes roll out.\nThe R3’s FFB feels wonderful when you laterally thunk into other cars—typically when you’re using “dodgem cars” cornering logic to pinball past an apex while pinging some competitor off into a tree. Likewise, the feelings you get through the wheel when you’re on the receiving end of such tactics and are forced to shred through some random fence or tyre pile are nice and visceral.Car-nage collisions aside, I’d also be remiss if I didn’t highlight how satisfying a stretch of clean racing can be—that basic yet intimate FFB conversation between balding tyres and terra firma. Obviously, with Wreckfest 2 having closer DNA to a rally experience than a staid, single-surface track racer, every lap can (literally) feel like a series of plot twists. You’d better believe your hands will notice the difference when you drift in and out of bitumen to gravel to mud and back again.\nOh, and it goes without saying that any time there’s a momentary lull in any and all force feedback followed by a wrist-rattling jolt, that is just…well, a chef’s kiss experience. I can furnish you with two memorable examples of this. One, whenever you get some sick Dukes of Hazzard air and land on something you shouldn't have. And two, reversing from a bad corner upset, flicking into neutral, and then getting utterly and unexpectedly blindsided by some AI trying to break theland speedbump record through you.\nIncidentally, I would like to say that POV racing in Wreckfest 2 with a decent FFB wheel such as this is the rough racing equivalent of a mini horror game. With your peripherals increasingly blinkered by the cabin of a crumpling car, every race is basically a series of untelegraphed jump scares that reach out and grab you through this wheel. Obviously this “driving on eggshells” sensation becomes more pronounced when you’re engaged in an actual demolition derby event, and some bastard has just bent your bonnet up over 80% of your windscreen.\nI honestly shudder to think what those unexpected crashes will feel like for any gamer gripping a Moza R12 or higher. Those impacts you’ll get with 12 or 16 Nm worth of grunt will surely be the stuff of warning label justification. Hell, even a surprise bash through the 3.9 Nm force of the R3 delivers a respectable hand rattle. As unthinkable as it may sound, you may actually find yourself turning it down.All that being said, multiplying the Moza R3 Bundle with the Early Access antics of Wreckfest 2 is one of the funnest things I’ve done all year thus far. Even as a proud owner of a Moza R12 wheelbase and pretty much every fancy add-on that comes with it, I was impressed by the performance and value proposition of this younger brother bundle. If you have budget aspirations of joining the simming scene—or you just wannafeelstuff crash harder than a stock market after tariffs—I say turn the key on an R3."

    "full_text": "No Man’s Skydeveloper Hello Games has detailed its latest update, Relics, which lets players become palaeontologists by digging up the skeletal remains of alien creatures. It’s out now across PC, console, and VR for free.\n\nWhen new bones are discovered, players can piece them together to their own design, Hello Games explained. They can even create their own museums, or share their collections with other players.\n“There is a truly huge variety of procedural prehistoric bones, in all shapes and sizes, to excavate and collect,” Hello Games added.\n“It’s up to you how you reassemble them and there’s a lot of fun to be had building ever-more outrageous skeletons to put on display in your bases-turned-museums or share with your fellow Travellers.\n“Fossils out there to be discovered vary hugely in rarity, so you never quite know what you’re going to unearth. There’s a real buzz when you find something truly rare. The most uncommon finds hold huge value. For those trying desperately to finish their collection, we introduced a specialist who can be bartered with at the Space Station.”\nAlongside the launch of Relics is a community expedition focusing on palaeontology, which challenges players to compete for the rarest finds.\n“Players should be wary where they choose to excavate though,” Hello Games warned.\n“Some things have been buried for a reason. Dangerous creatures guard the greatest treasure and may be awoken from their slumber, including Stone Ghosts, and the colossal Stone Golem. New creatures have been introduced too, along with their skeletons. Including the awesome skeletal Titan Worm!”\nNo Man’s Sky continues to receive free updates even now, years after launch. And it’s clearly keeping players interested. Hello Games saidthe recently released Worlds Part II updatefueled some of No Man’s Sky’s highest player numbers early in the year.\nIn November,Hello Games hailed No Man’s Sky hitting a ‘very positive’ Steam user review user ratingfor the first time, eight years after the game’s controversial launch was slammed by players.\nNo Man’s Sky launched in August 2016 on PS4 and PC to tens of thousands of negative reviews on Steam, with players complaining about broken promises and a lack of meaningful content, particularly on the multiplayer side. The game quickly settled on the dreaded ‘overwhelmingly negative’ Steam user review rating, a clear sign to anyone who visited its Steam page that something was very wrong.\nBut Guildford, England-based developer Hello Games has continued to update No Man’s Sky over the years, improving player sentiment to the point where it is now considered superb. It took two years to hit ‘mixed,’ then another three to hit ‘mostly positive.’ At the time, five years after launch, Tim Woodley, Head of Publishing at Hello Games,explained how hard it was to claw back Steam user reviews from such a low base.\nAs Hello Games continues to work on No Man’s Sky, it’s developing its next game,Light No Fire. It's about adventure, building, survival and exploration together, set on a fantasy planet the size of Earth.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

    "title": "Bleach Rebirth of Souls Review in Progress",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-21T21:49:27Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-review",
    "full_text": "Although Bleach is the flashiest member of the shonen anime “big three,” standing shoulder to shoulder with mega-popular series like One Piece and Naruto, it has long suffered from middle child syndrome when it comes to arena fighter adaptations. Bleach Rebirth of Souls aims to break the cycle ofrun-of-the-mill anime fightersthis series has previously been part of, delivering a unique action game that attempts to raise the genre to greater heights. Its story mode is admittedly an uneven jumble, ricocheting back and forth between a laughable attempt at a visual novel cobbled together like a last-second afterthought and a visually striking and stylish spectacle, as Bleach should be. But developer Tamsoft's herculean effort to enrich Rebirth of Souls with complex combat (with some room for improvement) saves it from being just another fly-by-night arena fighter.\n\nIt’s easy to get overloaded by a bunch of confusing anime jargon as Rebirth of Souls’ tutorial explains how its health bar, counters, and super moves work, but here’s the quick way to understand things: This is a 3D arena fighter with Super Smash Bros.’s life stock system, Sekiro’s stance-breaking swordplay, and Bleach’s unique visual flair. Unlike other arena fighters, which often have combat so shallow you only need to find a single combo or spam super moves to win matches, Bleach's combat feels like a challenging game of tug-of-war – one where victories are clinched rather than mindlessly stomped out of your opponents.\nEach sword swing feels snappy and weighty as you teleport around the screen, ambushing your enemies from behind and breaking their guard. It never gets old to see large blocks of text wrap around freeze-framed characters with every successfully landed counter and super move. Even when you play Rebirth of Souls on its Standard Mode button layout, which streamlines things by letting you dish out flashy auto-combos, it harbors a wink of complex and unique mechanics specific to each character that warrant further exploration. That could be Shinji's counter-heavy moveset or the in-your-face brawler style of my personal favorite, Soi Fon – it’s so satisfying to stun lock opponents whenever she zips all over the place with a flurry of punches and kicks. Plus, her super move is a massive missile arm canon that she has hunker down to fire, which is too enticing a contradiction to pass up as a main.\nHowever, Standard Mode matches do have a samey button rhythm to them after a while without much expression outside of mashing light and heavy button combos into a super. Having two move inputs that double as a distance closer alongside often unreliable ranged attacks does not make for a remarkable competitive game. It also doesn't help that the movement feels oddly stiff, with slow dashes and a scarcity of defensive options. Typically, whenever you're getting your ass kicked, fighting games bail you out by filling up your meter that effectively allows you to take some pressure off with a flashy super or counter. Other arena fighters like Naruto and Dragon Ball get around these counter move deficits by giving you a dedicated button to charge your super bars or spend portions of your meter for last second teleportations to avoid disaster.\nIn contrast, outside of two defensive retaliation mechanics called Awakenings and Reversals (with the former activating as a late-game transformation to buff your damage), the only way to build your super move or flash step teleports in Rebirth of Soils is tied to having dealt enough combos in the first place. The limited defensive mechanics grow even more dire when successfully blocking an opponent's offensive onslaught can be immediately undone by them comboing into a guard breaker — which should be virtually unheard of in any self respecting fighting game.\nAll of the above makes the back and forth of Standard Mode matches a bit tiring as you wait for a flash step bar to come back or pray you don't get whiff punished into oblivion thanks to a weird attack range. Thankfully, playing Rebirth of Souls in Manual Mode alleviates a lot of the restrictiveness those training wheels can cause, giving you the ability to mix together (or cancel out of) a variety of light and heavy combos into metered special moves. That makes Manual feel like the “intended” way to play if you’re looking for a more serious fighter because you aren't limited to a light and heavy combo string with the occasional super move punctuation mark. Manual Mode allows you to cancel out combos on a dime and deliver an infinite string of attacks, letting you effectively express yourself as you learn what assortment of attacks will deal the most damage while looking good doing so. That said, it could still do with more optimization to things like sluggish dashes, inconsistent attack range hit confirmations, and a deficit of defensive movements to make matches feel less rigid and constrictive.\nAs a massive fan of the Bleach anime and manga's stunning artistry, stirring character development, and shocking plot twists, I had high hopes that Rebirth of Souls could deliver a worthwhile story mode. Sadly, it's a bit of a mixed bag. By and large, cutscenes in an anime fighter should act as a sparkly reward at the end of battle, meant to bring the momentum of a fight to a thrilling climax. At the best of times, like in theNaruto: Ultimate Ninja Stormseries, they can be so well animated that they could substitute for watching the actual shows. That is not always the case with Rebirth of Souls – if anything, they nearly bring things to a screeching and embarrassing halt where you're not sure if you're meant to laugh on purpose or not.\nThe look of combat clearly had a lot of tender love and care put into it, but the story moments between that action instead play out like a cheap visual novel. Outside of a few pre-rendered cutscenes, the SparkNotes version of the anime this story mode attempts to tell is a rushed, hobbled mess. Instead of being greeted by bombastic scenes where my favorite characters clash, I was met with Machinima-looking animations where in-game models would fart out energy waves at each other and stiffly fall to the ground. Even the emotionally heady scenes lose all sense of tension as its characters move around like clumsy action figures with limited points of articulation in bright, low-poly arenas. What's more, exciting moments like sword clashes and beam struggles lose all of their gravitas as these scenes incessantly cut to black with bright slashes on the screen that look less like a creative choice for dramatic effect and more like a placeholder for an animation that wasn’t added in time.\nIf this was a genuine attempt to resemble a visual novel, it definitely missed the mark, as it feels more like an unfinished first draft – and with review codes less than a day before launch, it’s hard not to see this as an intentional hope that fans will buy-in based solely on the goodwill of the franchise. Which is a shame, because both its English and Japanese voice cast are putting in work with their vocal performances and the character models are faithful recreations that do look great in action. As if Bandai Namco took pointers fromInvincible season 2’s jokeabout how animators cut corners to make more scenes, Rebirth of Souls put all of its focus on the fights, and every moment outside of them looks like a fan-made animator’s first crack at recreating the anime as a result.\nAt the same time, however, Tamsoft is weirdly able to weaponize its limited, awkward looking cutscenes to drive home the charm of Bleach's filler episodes. Moments of levity during a handful of original story mode chapters where characters take a break from slashing each other to play high-stakes games of soccer, go on haunted house dates, or rinse each other at fighting games have the right kind of jank to their slapstick animation. These periodic excursions are disarmingly charming to watch. Side characters who'd otherwise be ignored on Rebirth of Souls roster like Shuhei or Izuru get more dimension to them, encouraging you to invest time in learning how to play them because of how compelling and personable their slice-of-life segments are.\nBleach Rebirth of Souls’ combat surpasses the typical anime arena fighter thanks to its intricate battle system and the effort that has been invested in making each character feel unique with their distinct play styles. Although the theatrics of its story mode do not consistently match the spectacle of its crisp character models, the vibrant sword slashes and stylish typography accompanying each super move help compensate for those shortcomings. Despite not fully delivering on its ambitious promise to elevate anime arena fighters to new heights, Rebirth of Souls is still a welcome latecomer to the genre for this series."

This item has over 1,800 reviews on Amazon with an average 4.4/5 star score and a respectableFakespot \"B\" rating. It has plenty of gaming features you wouldn't expect at this price point.\n\nThe KTC H27T13 is a 27\" monitor with a 2560x1440 resolution, which averages out to a sharp 109ppi pixel density. It's equipped with a pre-calibrated IPS panel with good color reproduction and wide viewing angles. It's decently fast with a refresh rate up to 100Hz and G-Sync compatibility.

You probably don't need an expensive monitor with a 4K resolution that will overly tax your PC or 240Hz refresh rate that will be hard to achieve. G-Sync technology, however, is especially useful for these budget builds, since your fps is more likely to fluctuate than higher-end builds and adaptive sync helps provide a smoother and tear-free experience.

Here’s the official blurb:\nIn its note to press, Studio Wildcard said Ark: Lost Colony “directly connects” the storylines of Ark’s Extinction and Genesis expansions and leads into the events of Ark 2.\nArk 2 is the Unreal Engine 5-powered sequel to the hugely successfulArk Survival Evolved. It was first announced with a surprise Vin Diesel cameo at The Game Awards 2020, at the time with a 2022 release date, but it was later delayed into 2023. Then, earlier in 2023,Ark 2 was delayed again, this time to late 2024 as an Xbox Series X and S console exclusive, day-one on Game Pass, and on PC via Steam and Windows.\nAs recently as December 2023,Studio Wildcard was still insisting Ark 2 was on track for a late 2024 release window. Obviously that didn’t happen, sparking concern from fans. So this announcement, coming three months into 2025, will help reassure fans that Ark 2 is still in the works, although Studio Wildcard failed to provide an updated release window.\nWe do have firmer details for Ark: Lost Colony, however. Pre-orders kick off in June 2025, and all purchases immediately unlock exclusive Ark: Lost Colony preview gameplay content.

    "title": "Is the Console War Finally Over?",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-08T17:30:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/is-the-console-war-finally-over",
    "full_text": "PlayStation or Xbox? It’s the long-running question of the modern video game world. At one point or another in your life, you’ve almost certainly been a part of this debate. Maybe you’ve started a Reddit thread, or made a TikTok video, or struck up a heated chat between friends about it. While therearegamers who preach the PC gospel, and Nintendo-as-god fanatics, much of the last two decades of video game history has been made as a result of Sony and Microsoft’s ongoing tete-a-tete. But is this ‘console war’ truly still being waged? The video game industry has gone through immense change in the last year, let alone over the previous two decades. Gamers’ habits, preferences, and options have all increased exponentially in part thanks to the rise of handheld gaming and younger generations’ expertise in building their own gaming machines. The battlefield is now practically unrecognisable compared to its tribal-like origins, but has a victor finally emerged from the trenches? Possibly – but the answer may surprise you.\n\nThe video game industry has rapidly evolved to become a financial juggernaut in recent years. In 2019, its worldwide revenue was $285 billion. Last year, it was $475 billion. That figure means that video games made more than the entire world wide movie and music industries in 2023, which made$308 billionand$28.6 billionrespectively. There’s no sign of this growth stopping, either. By 2029, the industry is estimated to generate nearly$700 billion. Not bad considering its humble Pong origins.\nAll this considered, it’s no surprise that we’ve seen an uptick in Hollywood actors flocking to be a part of a scene with such a lucrative present and future. Mads Mikkelsen, Keanu Reeves, Jon Bernthal and Willem Dafoe to name a few have all starred in games released in the past five years. Their involvement reflects the monumental shift in the perception of video games. Even industry titans like Disney are making significant in-roads into gaming, havingjust invested $1.5 billion into Epic Gamesas part of Bob Iger’s second term challenge to solidify a gaming presence for the company. A rising tide should lift all boats – unless you’re aboard the U.S.S. Microsoft, which seems to have sprung a leak.\nThe Xbox Series X and S consoles are intended to be an upgrade from the Xbox One in every way. But their advancements have yet to prove truly enticing; the One currently ranks above the Series X/S by almost double the sales. When you couple this fact with comments from analytics company Circana’s games industry expert, Mat Piscatella, who hassuggested that this current console generation is now past its selling peak, it paints a worrying picture for team Xbox. Things appear even worse when you look at console sales figures from 2024. According to Statista, the Xbox Series X/Ssold less than 2.5 million units across the entire year– the PlayStation 5sold the same figure in the first quarter of 2024 alone. There are also the allegations that Xbox is supposedly closing down its department which handles the manufacture and delivery of games to physical retailers, which feels ominously connected to itsevasive responseto areport that it plans to pull out of selling consoles in the EMEA region. If Xbox really has been involved in a ‘console war’, all of this points to the signal to retreat.\nBut Xbox isn't retreating – it has already surrendered. During the long Activision-Blizzard acquisition process, a statement from Microsoft found in the findings of fact revealed that the company doesn’t believe its Xbox division lost the console war –it thinks it never had a shot to begin with. So, what does a company built around a video game console do when its newest model is struggling to match its predecessor in sales, and its parent company openly remarks on its failure? It gets out of the console business.\nIt's no secret that Xbox Game Pass has become a key priority for the company.Leaked internal documentsrevealed the estimated prices Xbox expected to be asked to pay to put AAA-titles like Grand Theft Auto 5 ($12-15 million per month) and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor ($300 million) on the subscription service. Xbox taking such costs seriously demonstrates the company consolidating cloud gaming as a key direction for it moving forward. That goal is clear to see in Microsoft’s recent ‘This Is An Xbox’ advertising campaign, which suggests the company is keen to redefine how players think of Xbox – no longer a console, but an always-accessible service with some hardware to complement it instead.\nIt seems like this rethinking of what an Xbox is means that the brand’s official hardware won’t be limited to being a box under your TV. An Xbox handheld has been rumored to be in development for the past year or so, backed by another leaked document from the Activision-Blizzard dealings which hints at using handheld-friendly hardware for a next-gen'hybrid cloud gaming platform'. But Microsoft’s pivot in strategy has hardly been a secret. From its announcement of plans to createa mobile game storeto compete with Apple and Google, to Xbox chief Phil Spencer’s own admission that mobile gaming’s dominance in the sphere is shaping the company’s own path moving forward, the new M.O. seems simple: Xbox is the video game brand you can play whenever you want, wherever you are.\nSo why is Microsoft pivoting? Sure, Xbox has struggled over the past couple of generations, but doesn’t the video game console market reign supreme? You’d be surprised. In 2024, of the total 3.3 billion estimated video gamers,over 1.93 billion of them play via a mobile device. That, of course, includes your grandmother playing Candy Crush Saga and your “non-gamer” cousin who still clocks up hours of Clash of Clans. But mobile gaming is now so much more than these casual audiences – over the last decade it has quickly become the dominant pillar of the video game market among every generation, but especially Gen Z and Gen Alpha. In 2024, thetotal market valuation for the video game industrywas $184.3 billion, with mobile games comprising exactly half of that entire figure at $92.5 billion (a 2.8% increase from the previous year). Where do consoles weigh in? At just $50.3 billion, or 27%, and that’s dropped 4% since 2023. No wonder Microsoft wants to turn your phone into an Xbox.\nBut this isn’t a new development. By 2013, the Asian market for mobile gaming was already dwarfing that of the western world by heights of 759% in South Korea and 280% in China. You might think GTA 5 was the most profitable game of 2013, but you’d be wrong: Both Puzzle & Dragon and Candy Crush Saga outperformed Rockstar’s juggernaut by $1.5 and $1.4 billion respectively. Take a wide-angle lens to the 2010s as a whole for video games, and you’ll find that five of the highest-grossing games were mobile games – Crossfire, Monster Strike, Honor of Kings, Puzzle & Dragon, and Clash of Clans. When you look back on the decade, I highly doubt any of these titles immediately spring to mind – and yet, I’m sure most reading this have the start-up music for Clash of Clans seared into their brains.\nPhones are not the only platform drawing attention away from consoles. While not as significant as mobile gaming’s explosion, it’s clear to see that player habits have shifted toward a greater appreciation for PC gaming. Since 2014, there has been a year-on-year growth of 59 million new PC players, taking us from 1.31 billion in 2014 to1.86 billion in 2024. It’s worth noting this rise is complimented by a gargantuan 200 million in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic, during which streaming became a very attractive pastime for many house-bound players. But regardless of if Twitch called to them or not, gamers have become more technologically literate, educated by their peers online on how to build a PC powerhouse, what the best GPUs are, and how to overclock your circuit-ware. As a result, the PC’s global share of the video game market in 2024 lands at $41.5 billion – so it won’t be long until the PC battleline overtakes the army of console players, right? Well, maybe not.Netzoo’s 2016 Global Games Market Value reportdefined a $2.3 billion gap between console and PC – but in 2024, that gap has increased to $9 billion. So despite the rise of more advanced GPUs, circuit-boards, and Gen Z and Alpha’s technological craftiness, it’s a market that’s on thefallrather than the rise – at least for now. If that fall continues, it's not great news for Xbox, which has made Windows PCs its second home.\nBut it’s not just the dominance of mobile and the uncertain future of PC that Xbox has to contend with. Wars typically have two opposing sides, so it’s about time we looked at where PlayStation fits into this console war. Luckily for Sony, things are going pretty well. In its latest quarterly earnings report, Sony revealed75 million PS5s have been sold to date– that’s a big lead ahead of the combined 29.7 million sales for the Xbox Series X/S. The gap between the two consoles is widening, too; stats suggest that for every one Xbox Series X/S bought during November 2024,five PlayStation 5 consoles were also purchased(a ratio no doubt helped by the launch of the PS5 Pro.) Sony’s Game and Network Services also saw a healthy 12.3% bump in its profits during the final months of 2024, helped specifically by healthy first-party sales including Astro Bot selling 1.5 million copies in under two months, and lifetime sales for Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut surpassing 13 million. The future looks very bright for the PS5. Ampere Analysis’ games research director, Piers Harding-Rolls,estimates that by 2029, Sony will have sold 106.9 million consoles. How do things look for the Xbox Series X/S’s future? Well, leaked Microsoft documents estimate that by 2027,it expects to have sold around 56-59 million units. While it’s not a directly comparable projection, it’s not good. In order for Microsoft to re-establish its competitive edge in the current market, it will need to close the 5:1 PlayStation-to-Xbox gap, significantly increase the number of units sold year-on-year, and also bolster the profitability of its exclusives. Projections don’t support a positive outcome for those first two requirements, and given Phil Spencer’s ‘no red lines’ mantra on Xbox titles coming to PlayStation and Switch (possibly even including the next Halo title), the argument could be made that PlayStation is already the King of Console.\nBut looking at the PS5 in isolation paints a different picture. 50% of all PlayStation users arecurrently still playing on older PS4sinstead of PS5s, despite the newest generation now entering the second half of its life-cycle. Why is this? Well, of the top 20 best-selling games in the U.S. in 2024, only one is truly PS5-exclusive – Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, at #19. Helldivers 2 does feature at #3 but was also playable on PC at launch. Looking beyond last year, if we disregard remasters of PS4 games, there are roughly 15 genuine PS5-exclusive games on the console as a whole. There’s little here to justify the console’s price in many people’s eyes.\nIf the PS5 is struggling to justify its regular $500 price tag, then it's understandable why the $700 PS5 Pro debuted to a mixed reception to say the least. The general consensus amongst tech journalists is that perhaps this upgrade came tooearlywithin the cycle, especially given the games advertised in its campaign were slightly upscaled generation-old remasters. WhenIGN polled its readers, the result was overwhelmingly clear – the PS5 Pro has little to offer for forking over that much cash. So, simply put, the PS5 simply isn’t a must-buy console – at least, not yet. This will undoubtedly change when the behemoth that is Grand Theft Auto 6 finally releases later this year, which is almost guaranteed to become the shining star of this generation and the first chance for the PS5 to show off its true power.\nSo, is the console war over? If you’re Microsoft, it would appear there was never any belief that there was a chance to battle Sony for supremacy. If you’re Sony, your new console has become a success but lacks the true pedigree to be claimed as a new leap forward yet, feeling more like a bunny hop than anything else. The true winner of the console war seems to be those who chose not to play it at all. Rumors of mobile gaming companies encroaching onto the traditional console gaming sphere will only ramp up in the years to come, with Tencent rumored to be in talks to buy out Ubisoft from the Guillemot brothers, having already purchased Sumo Group in 2021. Mobile gaming is becoming increasingly pivotal to the sustainability and profitability of these companies – Take-Two Interactive claim that 10% of the world’s population plays its subsidiary Zynga’s games every month. That means that it’s more than likely that your grandma playing Zynga Poker and Words with Friends 2 is funding the continued development of Grand Theft Auto 6 – not a sentence you would expect to read five years ago, but one reflective of the new state of play of the video game market. The next five years of video gaming history will be defined less and less by who has the most powerful hardware, and more about whose cloud gaming server farm can expand the quickest and strongest. The console war is over, but the mobile gaming war (and the myriad of smaller conflicts that inevitably spin out of it) has only begun.\nSab Astley is a freelance writer who has written for IGN, Polygon, TotalFilm, Rolling Stone, Radio Times, and Metro UK.Editors note: this feature has been updated to better clarify sales figures of PlayStation and Xbox consoles."

    "full_text": "I didn’t think we’d see a proper Pokémon TCG restock this early in 2025. Honestly, I was betting on summer at best, but here we are with actual product showing up on Amazon and not behind some sketchy paywalled Discord server. While the internet’s currently losing its mind over Prismatic Evolutions and burning money chasing stock alerts for Rival Destinies, the smart play is scooping up the older sets that just hit Amazon Global. We’re talking Scarlet and Violet era stuff, Sword and Shield throwbacks, and boxes that were basically extinct six months ago.\n\nThis is the kind of flood the TCG community needed. Not just for collectors trying to complete sets, but for anyone who’s tired of battling bots for ETBs like it’s the Hunger Games. There’s a real mix available right now: Booster Bundles, Premium Collections, tins with actual storage value. And yes, even a few deals that make it feel like Amazon’s trying to keep the vibe positive. If you’re chasing big pulls like Greninja SIR or Pikachu ex SIR, or just need to stock up on sleeves and dice, this is the best stock refreshes we’ve seen in a while.\nAliExpress is currently offering theSony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphonesfor only $225.18 after coupon code:IFP7FJZis applied during checkout. This product is stocked in a US warehouse, so it ships free and arrives within about a week. This is an import model with a warranty that won't be honored in the United States. AliExpress makes up for it with a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days.\nIn our glowingSony WH1000XM5 review, Kevin Lee wrote that \"The Sony WH-1000XM5 is hands down the best sounding and most impressive noise-canceling headphones around. They demand a high premium but the cost of audio excellence is well worth it with this pair of headphones.\"\nThe real deal here is the fact that theTwilight MasqueradeElite Trainer Box is actually in stock. Seeing it available without a 200% markup or sketchy third-party seller feels borderline miraculous. You’re getting nine booster packs, a full-art Teal Mask Ogerpon promo, and all the usual ETB goodies like energy cards, condition markers, and themed sleeves.\nIt’s not every day you seeBrilliant StarsBuild and Battle Boxes in stock, let alone without having to navigate the wild west of resale sites. At $63.34, this one comes with four booster packs and a pre-release promo card, which makes it a solid pickup for collectors looking to flesh out their Sword and Shield era sets. Arceus VSTAR headlines the expansion, and the pull potential here still holds up.\nAmong Us 4-Pack on Steam is a sneaky little deal that gives you four copies of the game for the price of one, making it dangerously easy to rope your friends into a night of trust issues and vent-related betrayal. It supports cross-platform play, customizable settings, and chaotic emergency meetings that usually end with the wrong person getting ejected. If you’ve somehow missed the social deduction chaos, now’s the perfect time to catch up and take three crewmates down with you.\nTheHisuian Electrode V Boxis back in stock at Amazon for $42.45, which is a win considering how sporadically these pop up. It's one of those V boxes that slipped under the radar when it first launched, but now that Sword and Shield-era product is drying up it’s worth grabbing. You get a foil Hisuian Electrode V promo, a regular Electrode foil, an oversized version (because why not), and four booster packs to rip through.\nThis limited-edition snack box is a flavor-packed tribute toAssassin’s Creed Shadows, blending premium Japanese treats with collectible game merch in a way that feels like an edible side quest. You get 15 unique snacks, a full bag of exclusive Kit Kats, a custom Tenugui towel, and even an in-game item called The Hourglass that’s only available through this box. With artwork prints, a detailed snack guide, and a box sleeve that transforms into a display-worthy poster, it’s more than just snacks.\nSeeing theShining FatesPikachu V Box on Amazon again feels like spotting a shiny in the wild. At $49.96 it’s not exactly a steal, but having it in stock is the real value. This box comes with a foil Pikachu V promo, an oversized version for flair, and four Shining Fates booster packs. That means a legit shot at pulls from one of the most hype-filled sets of the Sword and Shield era.\nTheSurging SparksBooster Bundle is actually in stock at Amazon for $47.95, which is kind of a miracle considering how fast this set’s been disappearing. You get six booster packs from the newest Scarlet and Violet expansion, which includes some major chase cards like Pikachu ex SIR and Latias ex. If you missed the chaos of launch day or couldn’t snag a bundle without battling bots, this is your chance to catch up.\nI want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.\nThis phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.\nI can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.\nRimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.\nThis SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.\nI never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.\nI think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.\nApple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.\nBeats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art. The remastered soundtracks, modernized UI, and quality-of-life improvements bring these classics into the modern age while keeping their original charm intact. Each game features iconic character designs by Kazuko Shibuya and a faithful soundtrack rearranged by Nobuo Uematsu. Whether you’re reliving the golden age of RPGs or playing them for the first time, this bundle is the ultimate way to experience Final Fantasy’s roots. The limited-time sale price of $52.49, down from $74.99, makes this an easy win for any RPG fan.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experience Final Fantasy I through VI in glorious HD pixel art.

The limited-time sale price of $52.49, down from $74.99, makes this an easy win for any RPG fan.\nA genuine Apple leather case for $11.99? That’s not a typo. It’s an 80% discount. Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.\nIf you’re tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.\nWhy buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.\nIf you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.\nStill using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.\nThese aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.\nThese Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.\nLuxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.\nThis isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.\nFor those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says \"powerful Pokémon\" like an angry robot penguin).\nI'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.\nIf somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.\nYour PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).\nIf you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, \"I really need to delete some games,\" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.\nLogitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.\nSamsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room. The Acoustic Lens Subwoofer ensures deep, punchy bass, while Adaptive Sound and Game Mode Pro make sure everything from dialogue to explosions sounds crisp. At $764 off, this is the cheapest we’ve seen it outside of Black Friday.\nLG B4 OLED TVbrings incredible picture quality at a price that doesn’t require selling a kidney. It features Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, an α8 AI Processor that automatically enhances whatever you’re watching, and LG’s latest webOS for easy access to streaming apps and over 300 free LG Channels. Gamers get Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and VRR, plus four HDMI 2.1 ports. At $499.99, this is one of the best deals for an OLED right now.\nSamsung’s S90D OLED TVis a beast, packing AI-powered 4K upscaling, Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for silky smooth gameplay, and Dolby Atmos for immersive sound. Real Depth Enhancer makes everything look more lifelike, and PANTONE validation ensures accurate color reproduction. At $300 off, this is a great price for a high-end 65” OLED TV.\nSony’s WH-CH520 headphonesoffer 50 hours of battery life, customizable sound settings, and a lightweight, comfortable design. Multipoint connection makes switching between devices seamless, and DSEE upscaling improves compressed audio. At just $35.95, these are one of the best budget wireless headphones out there today.\nGoogle’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 bring top-tier noise cancellation, a Tensor A1 chip for AI-powered audio enhancements, and large 11mm drivers for rich bass. Conversation Detection automatically switches to transparency mode when you talk, so you don’t have to take them out. If you need premium wireless earbuds, this is asolid deal for these 9/10 buds.\nEnshrouded is a survival RPG with deep crafting, intense combat, and massive co-op potential. Play solo or team up with up to 16 friends, build custom bases, and fight through a dark, mysterious world. It’s still in early access, but at $23.99, it’s worth jumping in now aswe gave it 8/10.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

Whether you’re after high-speed action, epic RPG adventures, or deep strategy experiences, this week’s deals have something for every kind of gamer.\n\nIn retro news, I'm celebrating the 21st birthday of a series black sheep that still sold many a GameCube,Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. As a remake of the '98 PS classic, this was a pretty surreal (and, in parts, misguided) love letter. It was as if Snake had emerged from a time machine, equipped with the control scheme and acrobatics ofMGS 2: Sons of Liberty. Helmed by Silicon Knights and injected with the \"cinematic flair\" of Hollywood action director Ryuhei Kitamura, the end result divided fans quicker than a cyber-ninja disarming Ocelot.\nUpgrades like first-person aiming and being able to hang/drop from ledges were a double-edged sword. While they made Snake more powerful and adaptable, they also turned sections of his Shadow Moses op into a cakewalk. The level design, originally built for the PS1’s limitations, just wasn’t fully rebalanced to accommodate these new mechanics, and some re-recorded voice performances weren't ideal. Be that as it Mei [Ling], I still recall loving this at launch and adore the copy I own.\n-Far Cry(PC) 2004.Get\n-R-Type Final(PS2) 2004.Sequel\n-MGS: The Twin Snakes(GC) 2004.eBay\n-Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow(XB) 2004.eBay\n-MX Unleashed(PS2,XB) 2004.Get\n-MadWorld(Wii) 2009.eBay\nContents\nStarting with the Nintendo Switch,Sonic Frontiers($50, down 51%) brings the Blue Blur into open-world gameplay for the first time, and fun fact.

Originally, the developers planned to let players go full Dark Wizard, but this was pared back to keep things (somewhat) aligned with the Wizarding World’s tone.

    "full_text": "Monster Hunter WildsTitle Update 1 goes live tonight or tomorrow, depending on where you are in the world, and ahead of its release date, Capcom has published the patch notes so players can get a peek at what's in store.\n\nOver on theMonster Hunter site, the patch notes lay out everything for Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1. Some of this is info that's already been unveiled in previous streams, like theMonster Hunter Wilds showcase. But a few details spotlight the changes being made, both in the world and under the hood.\nTitle Update 1 goes live on Friday April 4, 2025 at 3am UTC / Thursday April 3, 2025 8pm PT. Capcom also provided the required space for the update:\nIt is Monster Hunter after all, so the new content and hunts take priority.Mizutsunearrives for HR 21 and up hunters in Title Update 1, while aTemperedMizutsune will arrive for HR 41 and up hunters after completing the extra Mizutsune mission. The big bad Zoh Shia is now a high-rank monster, with a story mission unlocking Zoh Shia at HR 50.\nAdditionally, new story, extra, and side missions will be added, as well as new weapons, armor, and skills. The upgrade limit has been increased for armor of rarity 5 and above, too.\nThe Grand Hub, an endgame gathering location for hunters. It can be unlocked by doing a tutorial mission appearing once you've hit HR 16, and will host Barrel Bowling, the Arena Quest Counter, the Canteen, the Arm Wrestling Barrel, and the Diva.\nThere will also be an Expedition Record Board with rankings for time attack quests. Add on new pop-up camp gear options, new pose sets and gestures, and even some new voice lines for Alma, and there's quite a bit of new stuff to see in Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1.\nPC players will be happy to see the improvements laid out prior are being implemented in Title Update 1. VRAM usage is being improved, and the DirectStorage version will be upgraded.\nAdditionally, numerous bug fixes are taking aim at game crashes, disappearing monsters, and the distance between the monster and the camera for certain monsters like Gore Magala.\nThere are some balance changes as well, though the extent remains to be seen. The Corrupted Mantle in particular has seen its effects \"adjusted,\" while other Mantle options like Rocksteady, Mending, and Evasion all received buffs.\nThe Bow is also getting some adjustments, with Dragon Piercer damage decreased but Thousand Dragons damage increased, Power Volley elemental values increased, and both Power Shot and Power Volley now affected by the Charge Master skill.\nThere arefurther updates detailed in the full patch notes here, running down all the fixes and adjustments arriving with Title Update 1 on April 4, 2025. More is expected to roll out after, with new monsters and events carrying on into the summer and Title Update 2. It seems like Capcom is determined to keep the momentum going with Monster Hunter Wilds.\nTo help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look atwhat Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you, and a guide toall 14 weapon typesin the game.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-march-11-2025",
    "full_text": "Here are the best deals for Tuesday, March 11. HIghlights include rare discounts on PS5 Dualsense controllers from Lenovo, an Asus Chromebook for just over $100 from Best Buy, the coveted AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D back in stock on Amazon at a non marked-up price, big savings on speedy Samsung SSDs, power banks for your handheld gaming PCs, and more.\n\nLenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code \"PLAY5\" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.\nLast year the 9th generation iPad was the least expensive iPad you could get brand new and with warranty. It was regularly priced at $179, but it went out of stock pretty much everywhere starting from Black Friday. Fortunately, it's back for one final harrah; right now, Walmart has it available for delivery for only $179 shipped. Seriously though, this deal probably won't last much longer so don't hesitate.\nAmazon is offering this Iniu 20,000mAh 65W USB Power Bank for only $21.59 after you clip the 40% off coupon on the product page (if you don't see it, try applying promo code \"WN9GQJRA\"). This is a great price for a high-capacity power bank that can deliver more power than other power banks at the same price point. The 65W of power delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, and iPhone 16 at their fastest rates.\n4TB for $259.99\nSamsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.\nIf you're in the process of building out a new gaming PC and you're looking for the best gaming processor, this is it. Right now, the recently releasedAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DAM5 desktop processor is back in stock on Amazon and Best Buy at its retail price of $479 shipped. This is the official launch price with zero markup, and it's not bundled with anything you don't want or need. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming processor currently on the market (across both AMD and Intel) and a better choice for gamers than the more expensiveIntel Core Ultra 9 285K.\nAMD's new Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards have been released, but just like their Nvidia counterparts, they're mostly out of stock and impossible to find at retail pricing. Don't fret, however, because you can still get these GPUs equipped in a prebuilt gaming PC for a reasonable price. The Radeon RX 9070 GPUs are the new mid-range champions of this generation. Both cards offer phenomenal performance while undercutting their Nvidia competition.\nApple's best earbuds are on sale today. Amazon is offering the second generationApple AirPods Prowireless noise-canceling earbuds for only $169.99 shipped, a savings of 32% and the best AirPods deal so far this year. That's about $20 more than theApple AirPods 4 with ANC, down from its usual $70 price premium. Between the two, the AirPods Pro is stillthe superior earbudsbecause it offers better sound quality and noise cancelation.\nChromebooks aren't exactly gaming-minded PCs, but they're compact, lightweight, great for productivity on the go, and in this case, a bargain. As part of Best Buy's Deal of the Day, you can pick up thisAsus 14\" Chromebookfor just $119 shipped after a $180 off instant discount, although I'd say the MSRP is a tad inflated. Even so, that's still a fantastic deal for a chromebook that features a relatively recent 8-core MediaTek processor which pairs well with Google Chrome OS.\nYou can grab this 10,000mAh power bank for only $8.99 after you clip the 10% off and 40% off clippable coupons on the product page. We very rarely see 10,000mAh power banks listed for under $10 so grab this one while you can. This will charge a Nintendo Switch from 0% to 100% about 1.9 times.\nFor a limited time, Hulu is offering four months of Disney+ and Hulu Basic (Ad-Supported) Bundle for just $2.99 per month. The normal cost of this subscription is $10.99 per month.

    "full_text": "Here are the best deals for Wednesday, March 12. Highlights include a rare discount on a (used) PlayStation Portal accessory, Lenovo-exclusive price drops on PS5 DualSense metallic controllers, the first discount we've seen on the iPad Air with M3 chip, USB Type-C cables for only $2.99 apiece, Destiny-themed SteelSeries gaming headsets, and more.\n\nUsed: Like New Condition\nLooks and functions as if it were new. Moderate packing damage observed during inspection.\nThePlayStation Portalhas never been discounted, but at least you can save on a used one.Amazon Resale(a rebranded Amazon Warehouse) currently has Used: Like New condition PS Portals in stock for only $158.70 shipped. It retails for $199 new, so that's a substantial 20% in savings. A Sony warranty may or may not be included, but Amazon Resale items benefit from the same 30-day return policy you get for buying a new item. We expect this item to sell out pretty quickly.\nLenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code \"PLAY5\" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.\nAmazon is offering a 6-foot INIU USB Type-A to USB Type-C cable for only $2.99 when you apply promo code \"C2ALZ6LN\" during checkout. You can add as many cables as you like and the discount should be applied to each and every cable. These cables are sheathed in nylon braiding for durability and can be used for both data sync and charging (Quick Charge 3.1A compatible). This is a great opportunity to stock up.\nIf you're thinking of jumping on the AMD bandwagon for your next upgrade, now is certainly the right time to do so. Alongside theRyzen 7 9800X3Dwhich debuted earlier this year, AMD has just released its two higher-end Ryzen 9 siblings in the Zen 5 \"X3D\" stack: the9950X3Dis available for $699 and the9900X3Dis available for $599. Collectively, these processors represent the best gaming chips across both Intel and AMD. Pure gamers should go with the 9800X3D and allocate their funds elsewhere; creators with deeper pockets and a penchant for gaming will benefit from the immense performance uplift on the new Ryzen 9 processors thanks to their increased core count and cache.\nThenew iPad Airsits in the middle of Apple’s tablet lineup, with better specs than the baseline iPad, but it’s not as powerful as the iPad Pro. That said, if you need more computing power in a tablet than what the baseline device above offers, the new iPad Air with M3 chip will likely suit you just fine.\nAs you can tell by the name, it has Apple’s powerful M3 chip, and it supports Apple Intelligence, unlike the baseline model. It’s also compatible with a new Magic Keyboard (see it at Apple) that has a row of function keys and a trackpad.\nAs part of its Spring Sale, SteelSeries is taking 40% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets.

Right now, theHP Omen 25L GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super Gaming PChas dropped to $1,399.99 shipped after you apply $50 off coupon code \"HPDAYSPC50\". This is quite easily the lowest price we've seen for a prebuilt RTX 4070 Ti Super gaming desktop.\nAmazon is offering a four-pack ofApple AirTagskeyfinders for only $64.49. That's over $35 off the retail price and only $16.10 for each AirTag. This is a very practical accessory for anyone who owns an iPhone and tends to lose small wearables like wallets, keys, or remotes.\n4TB for $259.99\nSamsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.\nApple's best earbuds are on sale today. Amazon is offering the second generationApple AirPods Prowireless noise-canceling earbuds for only $169.99 shipped, a savings of 32% and the best AirPods deal so far this year. That's about $20 more than theApple AirPods 4 with ANC, down from its usual $70 price premium. Between the two, the AirPods Pro is stillthe superior earbudsbecause it offers better sound quality and noise cancelation.\nYou can grab this 10,000mAh power bank for only $8.99 after you clip the 10% off and 40% off clippable coupons on the product page. We very rarely see 10,000mAh power banks listed for under $10 so grab this one while you can.

    "full_text": "inZOIhas sold 1 million copies in a week, developer and publisher Krafton has announced. That’s the fastest sales milestone ever for a game published by the South Korean megacorp.\n\nKrafton’s The Sims competitor launched on PC via Steam in Early Access form on March 28 and quickly hit the headlinesafter players discovered they could run over and kill children. Krafton responded to say it had patched out what it called an \"unintended bug.\"\nDespite this hiccup, inZOI has a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam, and saw a peak of 175,000 concurrent viewers on Twitch, ranking third in the Games category. It rose to number one on Steam’s Global Top Sellers List (by sales revenue) just 40 minutes after release.\nMeanwhile, Canvas, inZOI’s in-game user-generated content (UGC) sharing platform, saw over 1.2 million “participants” on launch day, and over 470,000 pieces of content uploaded.\nIGN’sinZOI Early Access reviewreturned a 6/10. We said: “inZOI is a visually striking life simulator with plenty of ambition, but not enough depth as of its Early Access launch.”\nClearly, inZOI is doing the business for Krafton, which highlighted its work promoting the game ahead of launch and its communication with the community as helping to build trust and momentum for release. The inZOI global showcase and demo build “particularly attracted high interest,” Krafton added.\nCEO CH Kim commented: “We are grateful and excited to present inZOI to players around the world through Early Access. We will continue to actively communicate with players and foster inZOI as Krafton’s long-term franchise IP.”\nAs for what’s next, Krafton said future updates will introduce new content, including mod support and new cities, with all updates and DLC provided for free until full release.\nIn a recent note to players, Krafton said it will “quickly” apply fixes for reported issues through hotfixes during April amid complaints from some players about the state of the game. The scale of inZOI’s global community is “a next-level experience for us,” Krafton said, before admitting it’s “going through some trial and error in finding the optimal means of communication.”\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

That's about 33% off and better thanAmazon's Spring Sale.\n\nLenovo might not be the first store you'd think of for great deals on PlayStation controllers, but surprisingly, no one can match their pricing. This might be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, at least untilSony's PlayStation Days of Play Salethat will probably happen sometime in late May.\nThe original PS5 DualSense controller is decked out in the same white color scheme as the console itself and retails for $69.99. Since then,Sony has consistently released more and more colors, some of them more striking than others. In late 2023, Sony launched theDeep Earth collection, \"a new metallic colorway for PS5 accessories\" with aptly sounding names like Sterling Silver, Volcanic Red, and Cobalt Blue. These controllers retailed for $79.99 and were (and still are) one of the more striking color schemes. We rarely see these on sale compared to the other colors.\nColor aside, the Dualsense is oft regarded as thebest PS5 controller under $100. It also makes for an excellent controller for your PC. The DualSense is modeled after the tried and true design and layout of previous PlayStation controllers, but it also packs in modern features such as haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone and speaker, integrated touchpad, internal gyroscope and accelerometer for motion sensing, and USB Type-C charging.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

While some of the other selections are £4.50 more, the whole selection of colours available for these Series X|S controllers has had a price reduction, so you're getting at least 33% off whichever one you like most.\n\nAs a second or spare controller for your Xbox Series X or S console, along with supported games on PC, all those on sale at Amazon right now include the following colours:\nAlthough the standard Carbon Black and Robot White—those bundled with the Xbox Series X & S consoles respectively—have been reduced to the lowest price of £35.99, all of the alternative colors have been dropped to a slightly higher yet still impressive £40.49. If you're in need of a new controller to play the newest games, likeCall of Duty: Black Ops 6which is on sale now as well, this is a fantastic opportunity.\nYou have to flaunt Amazon a little bit more of your cash to add a splash of style to your setup with one of these vivid color schemes likeAstral Purple, but it does seem worth it. What's more, these other models include the controller's updated design, featuring the X, A, B, and Y buttons being switched from their respective blue, green, red, and yellow colours to match that of their controllers' body.\nThe original button colours are still shown as tiny dots next to each one, but this update overall gives the controllers a more modest, sleeker appeal that arguably justifies the slightly larger price investment.\nFor those after a controller with a design that boasts more than one solid colour, Amazon UK also has the Special Fire Vapor Edition of the Xbox Series X|S controller as well,reduced by 20% to £51.99. Featuring titular vapor-like red-and-orange swirls, this bold colour scheme will invoke a little extra energy into your console setup if that's what you're looking for.\nBen Williams– IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

And alongside arriving in the Switch 2 launch window, Agent 47 will also be donning some new, appropriately Nintendo-themed duds.\n\nOnIO Interactive's site, the developer confirmed Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition will go up for pre-order soon, for both digital and physical editions. A pre-order of the digital edition will get you the Signature Pack, which includes two red-and-white outfits for Agent 47, a golden wrench, and a mushroom. Mushroom effects unknown at this time.\nPhysical pre-orders, meanwhile, offer both the Signature Pack and the Quack Pack, which offers a Luigi-themed green-and-grey suit and a green rubber duck. Much like a bald guy in a red tie and suit at a Paris fashion show, nothing unusual to see here.\nLess-than-subtle references aside, it's fun to see Agent 47 get some Nintendo attire. Other games likeBayonettaandThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrimgot their own Nintendo crossover cosmetics, and Agent 47 certainly has earned a bit of Nintendo theming of his own.\nThe World of Assassination spans a trilogy of games, as Agent 47 undertakes a number of missions to assassinate targets and complete contracts for his clientele. Starting with 2016's Hitman, the WoA trilogy runs up through Hitman III, whichIGN gave a 9, saying: \"Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is one of the barcoded butcher's best appearances.\"\nHitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition combines all of it together into one package. This includes the main campaign, contracts mode, escalations, Elusive Target arcades, and featured live content for Hitman, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3. Also included is the Freelancer game mode, a roguelike option for those who want even more variety and options in their Hitman experience.\nCurrently, Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition is due to arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in June 2025.

It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.\n\n4TB for $259.99\nThe Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.\nThe Samsung 990 Evo Plus does not have a preinstalled heatsink. However, the 990 Evo Plus SSD is a newer single-sided SSD design that is power efficient and doesn't generate as much heat as SSDs from before. That means you probably don't need to use a heatsink and it should still work perfectly fine in a PS5 console without any thermal throttling.

For a few days only, the LG online store is offering a 25% off coupon code \"SAVE25\" that drops the price by to $749.99 shipped.

This monitor uses LG's latest generation WOLED panel, which offers near instantaneous response times (0.03ms) and true black levels that can't be matched by any other panel type, including Mini-LED. The GX790 also boasts a 98.5% DCI-P3 color range, HDR True Black 400 certification, and is factory calibrated. Connectivity wise, the GX790 includes one DisplayPort 2.1 port (which you will need to use to get 480Hz), two HDMI 1.4 ports, and two USB 3.0 ports.\nBecause the GX790 combines an OLED panel with a super high refresh rate, it excels at games with a lot of fast or twitchy motion like shooters.

    "title": "Nintendo Switch 2 Tech Analysis: Is 4K Actually Realistic?",
    "publishedAt": "2025-04-04T18:47:02Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-analysis-is-4k-actually-realistic",
    "full_text": "TheNintendo Switch 2has finally been revealed, and while it brings huge improvements over the original console, it doesn’t exist in the same vacuum that the original handheld did. With the introduction of devices like theSteam DeckandAsus ROG Ally X, a ton of handheld gaming systems out there can play AAA PC games on the go.\n\nSo, while the Switch 2 will automatically have a niche carved out for being a system that plays, well, Nintendo games likeMario Kart World,anyone that’s buying a Switch 2 to play multiplatform games will have to reckon with devices like the Steam Deck – especially with the Switch 2’s $449 price tag.\nNow that Nintendo has given a sneak peek into the hardware that’s running its new console, we can take a look at how exactly it will run, and whether or not its 4K promises are more than empty words.\nThe SoC (System on a Chip) that runs the Nintendo Switch 2 is probably the most important part of the console, but it’s the thing we know the least about. We do know that it’s a “custom Nvidia processor” thatsupports DLSS and ray tracing, but beyond that, neither Nintendo nor Nvidia have revealed any specifics. Luckily, there are a ton of leaks that suggest the Nintendo Switch 2 is using the aging Ampere graphics architecture behind theRTX 3080.\nGoing all the way back to 2023, there wereleaks suggesting that the Nintendo Switch 2 would be using the Nvidia Tegra T239 SoC. This APU uses 8 ARM A78C cores, combined with an Nvidia Ampere GPU with 1,536 CUDA cores. Napkin math puts that at 12 Streaming Multiprocessors, which would be significantly smaller than even the smallest Ampere GPU – the RTX 3050 for laptops. However, assuming Nvidia didn’t nerf the Ampere SMs in the T239, each SM would have four Tensor Cores and an RT core, making for a total of 48 and 12, respectively.\nTo be fair, the Steam Deck is using a custom AMD APU that’s built on 8 AMD RDNA 2 GPU cores, which is smaller than what Nintendo is offering here. But, you have to keep in mind that the Steam Deck has a lower resolution display, and pumps more power into it. Plus,AMD Z2 processorsare coming out over the next year, with the Z2 Extreme featuring 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, which will be a huge upgrade. Though, systems with that chipset are going to bemuchmore expensive than the Switch 2.\nThat small of a GPU basically makes 4K gaming an impossibility natively, but because the Tensor Cores are there, DLSS is going to be a major factor in how the Nintendo Switch performs when docked – assuming this is the SoC that’s actually in the system. However, with so few Tensor Cores, even upscaling to 4K is going to be a stretch in everything but the most lightweight games.\nInstead, most games are likely going to target 1080p, even if they don’t natively render at that resolution. There are games like Donkey Kong Bananza that do seem to be rendering at a native 1080p resolution, according toDigital Foundry’s hands-on demos. However, third-party games like Cyberpunk 2077 seem to be relying heavily on upscaling, with native resolutions as low as 540p. I wouldn’t expect the Nintendo Switch 2 to ever be able to handle Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K, even with DLSS, though Nintendo will definitely have better luck with any game it can get running natively at 1080p.\nThe Ampere cores in the rumored T239 also have RT cores, which should theoretically allow for ray tracing in Nintendo Switch 2 games. Though, again, this will be heavily constrained by the processor’s 12 RT cores. Ray tracing will be possible, but don’t expect any jaw-dropping implementations of the technology, and especially don’t expect it in games likeCyberpunk 2077.\nEven with RT cores, ray tracing is an extremely expensive workload for the GPU, and the T239 is limited by more than just its small SM count – power is a huge limiting factor, too. I spoke withRichard Leadbetter over at Digital Foundry, who told me that the entire system likely consumes as little as 10W, including the display, the SoC, and the mainboard. We won’t know exactly what the T239’s actual TDP (thermal design power) is until someone finds a way to measure it, but it likely leaves only 5-6W for the SoC itself – a third of the power of the Steam Deck’s AMD APU.\nHowever, while the Nintendo Switch 2 might not be able to produce the same amount of power as ahandheld gaming PClike the Asus ROG Ally X, that doesn’t mean there won’t be gorgeous games running on the system. After all, games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza look stunning, and it goes to show how clever Nintendo developers are at getting the most out of the hardware in the Switch.\nAfter all, the original Nintendo Switch was powered by the Nvidia Tegra X1, which was built on thenow-ancient Maxwell graphics architectureand only packed 256 CUDA cores. Ampere is orders of magnitude more efficient than Maxwell even on its best days, and there are six times more cores in the Switch 2’s GPU. The Nintendo Switch 2 should bewayfaster than the original console, which bodes well for cross-generation ports like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\nWhile a total system power budget of 10W means the system isn’t quite as fast as it could be, it does mean the battery will have a much better time keeping up. Nintendo has come out and said it should last around 2 hours at a minimum. That’s less than was quoted for the original Switch, but that shouldn’t be too surprising, due to its higher-resolution display and more powerful processor.\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 has a 5,220mAh battery, a large step up from the 4,310mAh battery in the original console. That’s a sizable jump, and if its battery has the same voltage of the original Switch, that would equate to around 19Whr. That’s a smaller battery than theSteam Deck, which is probably why Nintendo quotes a similar battery life to the Steam Deck, despite its less power-hungry processor.\nNintendo probably could have put a more powerful battery in the Switch 2, but its decision likely came down to size constraints. There’s only so much battery that’ll fit while retaining the same thickness as the original Nintendo Switch, after all.\nThe most striking difference at first glancebetween the Switch and Switch 2is probably going to be the display. While it doesn’t have the OLED screen that made theSwitch OLEDsuch a marvel, the display is bigger and has a higher resolution. The Nintendo Switch 2 sports a 7.9-inch LCD display with a resolution of 1920x1080 with HDR 10 support. The display is also fast, supporting variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. That’s honestly a bit overkill considering the silicon powering the thing, but it does mean that older games or indie titles will feel extremely smooth – assuming they have unlocked frame rates. 120Hz is also a useful refresh rate for games that target 40fps since that makes for a clean ratio that won’t result in excessive stuttering.\nNintendo hasn’t released any information about the brightness of the display, but the HDR 10 certification means it needs toat leasthave a peak brightness of 1,000 nits, so it’s going to be a bright screen. We don’t know exactly how color performance will turn out either, but Nintendo does claim that it supports WCG, or Wide Color Gamut.\nThe display is probably going to be the thing that lifts the Nintendo Switch 2 above its competitors. The Steam Deck LCD has an 800p display with a peak brightness of 400 nits, and it doesn’t support WCG. The Steam Deck OLED does offer a much nicer display, but it’s still an 800p display. The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is also a huge upgrade over the original, which had a 6.2-inch, 720p LCD display.\nIn a vacuum, the Nintendo Switch 2 is massively better than the original Nintendo Switch. It’s leagues faster, has a screen that’s bigger, brighter and sharper, and has Joy-Con that you don’t have to wrestle with to disconnect. The only problem is that the Switch doesn’t exist in a vacuum anymore.\nThere are a ton of handheld gaming systems out there now, and while most of them are more expensive than the $449 Nintendo Switch 2, they likely offer a better gameplay experience in multi-platform games. The real appeal of the Switch 2 is going to be Nintendo’s catalog of first-party games, just like with the original console. Nintendo is known for making great games that make the most of its – relatively – weak hardware. If you’re the type of gamer that falls in love with Nintendo games, then the Nintendo Switch 2 makes a lot of sense. However, if you’re just going to get this thing to play Cyberpunk or Elden Ring on the train, there arebetter gaming handheld optionsout there.\nJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

    "publishedAt": "2025-03-26T14:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/honor-of-kings-world-the-first-preview",
    "full_text": "If you didn’t already know it, Honor of Kings is one of the most played games in the world. Taking the number one spot in the Chinese MOBA charts, the TiMi Group is taking its free-to-play characters – and world – in a new direction with Honor of Kings: World. While its scale and monetization screech in dissonance, its flashy combat, diverse roster of playable classes, and multiplayer-flexible modes do carry some promise.\n\nDuring my half-hour-long hands-on with Honor of Kings: World at Tencent’s GDC booth, I took some time to toy around with a couple of World’s different classes, take on a boss inspired by Chinese folklore, and see a brief glimpse of the story.\nAlthough it boasts many of the same characters as its mobile MOBA predecessor, Honor of Kings: World is no MOBA. Instead, it’s a class-driven action game – for PC as well as mobile, by the way – with the kind of over-the-shoulder, action-driven combat you might expect from something like Genshin Impact. But rather than locking mechanics or gameplay behind randomized drops like in MiHoYo’s game, Honor of Kings offers players different classes to choose from. And while the same overall control scheme unifies each class – a dodge, three standard abilities, and an ultimate of sorts – the roster of different classes struck me as fairly diverse, each with its own abilities and special perks.\nUsually, you’ll be able to play with two separate classes, though sometimes you might need to stick with just one for story purposes. It seems like TiMi’s put a lot of effort into the dual-class system, allowing you to switch between the two during combat. The most interesting example they showed during my demo was starting a long, multiple-attack combo and switching characters once the target was launched into the air to extend a combo. It kind of reminded me of a tag system in a fighting game.\nWith 11 different classes in the demo I played, I’m certain there are tons of different combinations and ways to style on your opponent. But since this was my first time playing, I looked for balance above all else: I stuck with an even-keeled loadout, using a sword-wielding class for my primary role and a ranged gunner for the second. The two nicely filled in gaps left by the other during my attempt at a boss fight: I’d lay down fire using the gunner’s active reload mechanic to improve my damage and rate of fire when the boss was spitting out attacks in a frenzy, making sure to dodge the occasional flaming projectile and then rush him down with my sword, laying on the damage with a vengeance.\nThis swapping was easily my favorite part of the demo. I enjoyed hammering away at the boss’s stance meter, breaking his stance, and shooting the gunner’s R ability as I closed the distance, swapping to my sword class, and unleashing a devastating ultimate attack of sorts to juice every second from the boss’ temporarily weakened state.\nTaking the boss down to a certain point also revealed an interesting story beat that eventually led to me playing as a completely separate character from the pre-built avatar provided for the demo. TiMi didn’t offer much information on how frequently to expect this kind of change, only that it would happen from time to time. The demo took place somewhere closer to halfway through Honor of Kings: World’s runtime, opening up my two classes’ skill trees just enough for me to have some fun with them without overcomplicating its combat.\nThe boss itself was a giant monkey character with various different masks, with a personality and attacking style for each. According to the developer leading my demo, this mechanic has its roots in a traditional style of Chinese theater calledBian lian. One mask might see him spitting fire in a massive area of effect on the map, while another might see him throw around a few melee attacks. I loved this melding of culture, history, and story with a gameplay mechanic.\nAside from briefly seeing another journalist in my demo in a hub area before the tutorial, I didn’t have a chance to check out any of World’s multiplayer offerings. TiMi showed a few clips of four-person squads crawling dungeons and taking on bosses before our demo, but teased something that sounded more like an MMO. That part is still a work in progress, so they didn’t share much beyond acknowledging that there would be a bigger scale multiplayer mode in the full game, so I’m curious to see what that looks like given my demo’s single-player scope.\nBefore the demo, one of TiMi’s developers walked me through some of World’s premise and setup, saying that Honor of Kings: World was a gift of sorts to the MOBA’s loyal fanbase that’s propelled it to massive success in the ten years since its launch. True as that may be, I left the demo concerned about monetization.\nWhen another journalist asked about how TiMi plans to make money with Honor of Kings: World, the developer leading our session gave a concerning answer. “The game’s gonna be based around social, so outfits and stuff,” they said.\nOn its own, funding a free-to-play game with cosmetics isn’t necessarily a problem – especially since the developers made it clear that there wouldn’t be any pay-to-win – but given Honor of Kings: World’s scale, with flashy cutscenes, tons of playable characters, and epic boss fights, I can’t help but feel concerned about whether or not World’s model is financially sustainable, regardless of whether or not it’s based on one of the most successful games of the century.\nHonor of Kings: World undoubtedly has a bright future ahead of it, provided TiMi can stick to its promise of giving fans of its MOBA hit a celebration worthy of its success. Even though I’m still a little worried about the amount of microtransactions that Honor of Kings: World could potentially need to fund its high production value, I still had a ton of fun dodging the big primate’s swings."

    "publishedAt": "2025-03-13T19:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-x-first-hands-on-preview-the-new-dual-front-mode-reinvigorates-the-10-year-old-fps",
    "full_text": "When I was in high school, I would stay up ‘til all kinds of ungodly hours of the night playing PC games. I even stayed up five days straight once, just to get to the end of Baldur’s Gate II ‘Throne of Bhaal,’ but what fascinated me about PC games most was how inventive they could be.\n\nOne that struck my imagination powerfully was Red Faction, which caught my eye because it had some of the hallmarks of DOOM (a high-tech, first-person shooter set on Mars, you say?) yet it added an essential wrinkle; terrain deformation. Red Faction is set in the mines of Mars, and I could fire explosive weapons at walls, creating holes or destroying them, and even tunneling through rock to circumvent checkpoints. It was all about charting your own course and finding your own path to accomplish your goals. It was incredible.\nUnfortunately, not a lot has been done with that idea in the intervening years, but when Rainbow Six Siege came out, the ability to freely climb and rappel up and down buildings, and shoot through or destroy walls and ceilings sent a delightful little tickle through my Red Faction-loving brain.\nWhile Siege began as a far more focused (and less exploratory) affair than the old Volition shooter, that (and quite a bit more) is about to change with the arrival of the upcoming Siege X update. Apart from gameplay, graphical, auditory, and UI enhancements, it introduces what is shaping up to be a fantastic new permanent multiplayer mode: Dual Front.\nIn Dual Front, a predetermined seasonal Operator pool will dictate who you can play, and team sizes are bumped up to six per side. Instead of spawning directly inside (or outside) one target area, there are three large areas to choose from, each with its own objective, so your team of six will need to split up to focus on both defending and attacking different locations simultaneously.\nWhile the scope has expanded, much of the great core gameplay remains the same. When a match starts, each team will spawn in their squad HQ and one of two locations in your team’s sector will start a countdown to a Defend mission. The     is true for your opponents, so each team will need to defend one spot while attacking another. How you handle that, and where you decide to go, is up to you.\nWhat’s more, there is a neutral zone in between the mirrored zones held by each team, and extra objectives will appear there. Completing those objectives, such as rescuing a hostage and getting them to an extraction point, will give your team a big boost in the back-and-forth struggle for supremacy, so even if you fail to defend your first location or attack the enemy base, victory is still possible.\nSince Dual Front expands the contested space so significantly, I was moving between attacking and defending to suit the team's needs, creating a more free flowing experience with way more variation between matches than your standard Siege match. What results is a fluid, chaotic mess I had a blast with.\nThe seasonal Operator pools will be updated every month, and because your squad will need to do a little bit of everything, you’ll have access to both Attacker and Defender Operators on the character select screen. When you die during a match, you’ll quickly respawn and re-select your Operator, so changing strategies on the fly to counter your enemies is a central (and delightfully fun) part of the game now.\nSeveral times during my preview, it looked like my current (attacking) team was in a great spot, so I would rush across the map to help my other beleaguered comrades who were fighting for their lives to defend our own base objective. Sometimes, everything was as it seemed: I arrived in time, and our team brought home a victory. Other times, I got separated from my team only for them to be ambushed by reinforcements. Each match was tense, because in maps as large as Dual Front’s, it’s difficult to know where the enemy is until they become a capital “p” Problem.\nSpeaking of navigating larger areas, I should mention some of the new gameplay additions. You can now rappel around corners of buildings and even sprint while rappelling, so it’s easier to poke around and find ways to get inside structures. New fire extinguishers create concussive blasts and visual obfuscation when destroyed, gas pipes can be shot or damaged to create jets of fire before exploding and scattering fire around on the ground, and metal detectors can be disabled temporarily or permanently. Overall, it’s more fun to play in the space, and there is a lot more space to play in on Dual Front’s mirrored map.\nSiege X also marks a shift in monetization. After the update, Siege will adopt a free-to-play model, and for casual versus competitive stuff, here’s the skinny: casual and onboarding playlists, unranked quickplay, and Dual Front are all free, and will grant access to up to 26 Operators and skins. Siege Cup and Ranked modes will be pay-to-unlock, and grant access to all 50 Operators. So if you are jumping in as a casual player, there are no barriers to entry, but new players who want to get more serious on the competitive side will need to fork over some cash. If you already have Siege, don’t worry; you will keep everything you have, and retain access to all modes (and as an added bonus, Siege players will get a badge showing off the year they started and a little bonus for each year of Siege they played).\nSome other updates in the Siege X package include five modernized maps (Clubhouse, Chalet, Bank, Kafe, and Border), enhanced visuals, audio, first-person shadows, new menus, better player onboarding, the ability to inspect weapons, and a lot more. The dev team has also committed to introduce a new Operator (or remastering an existing one) each season, and a bunch more.\nBut all those enhancements pale in comparison to Dual Front, which is on track to become my favorite mode for Siege, and once Siege X launches, it’s likely to be the only mode I’ll play as Siege marks its upcoming tenth birthday in an incredibly fun way."

    "full_text": "While theNvidia GeForce RTX 5090sits comfortably at the top of the graphics card market, not many people realistically have the cash to throw at its $1,999+ price tag. Luckily, you don’t have to lose out on 4K gaming just because you can’t afford the absolutebest graphics card. Both theNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Tiand theAMD Radeon RX 9070 XTare much more affordable and deliver an extremely solid 4K gaming experience.\n\nWhile prices right now are unfortunately elevated – due in large part to the heightened demand and low supply any GPU faces right after launch – the RTX 5070 Ti and RX 9070 XT are the graphics cards most people should be looking at for a high-end gaming experience.\nComparing two graphics cards that use entirely different graphics architectures on specs is incredibly complicated. While Nvidia’s CUDA cores and AMD’s Shading Units serve a similar purpose, they’re different enough that a direct comparison from a purely quantity perspective is essentially pointless.\nThe AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT consists of 64 RDNA 4 compute units, each with 64 shader units, making for a total of 4,096. Each of those compute units also has two AI Accelerators and one RT Accelerator, making for 128 and 64, respectively. AMD pairs these compute units with 16GB of GDDR6 memory on a 256-bit bus, which should be more than enough for modern games, though it could be stretched in the future, especially at 4K.\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti also has 16GB of VRAM, but instead of opting for GDDR6, Team Green went with the new GDDR7, which is theoretically much faster. That’s also on a 256-bit bus, but because of higher memory speeds, it has higher bandwidth. The RTX 5070 Ti is built with 70 Streaming Multiprocessors – Nvidia’s name for Compute Units, with a total of 8,960 CUDA Cores, or Shading Units. That’s twice as many Shader Units per Compute Unit, something Nvidia has been pulling off since the RTX 3080 back in 2020. However, that doesn’t directly lead to double the performance.\nWinner:Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti\nWhile on paper the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti looks far superior to the Radeon RX 9070 XT, the performance doesn’t quite work out that way. Instead, both graphics cards are excellent entry-level cards for anyone who wants to play at 4K, and are among the best graphics cards on the market for 1440p gaming.\nWhen I reviewed theAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT, I expected it to be within reaching distance of the RTX 5070 Ti, falling further behind in games with a lot of ray tracing. However, I found that even in games like Cyberpunk 2077, the AMD graphics card had no problem staying within a few frames of the much more expensive RTX 5070 Ti.\nThere are certainly games where the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti pulls ahead. For example, in Total War: Warhammer 3, the RTX 5070 Ti gets 87fps at 4K, compared to the 9070 XT’s 76fps. But even with Nvidia’s occasional wins, I found that the Radeon RX 9070 XT was on average 2% faster than the 5070 Ti. That’s a minor difference, but even 2% is a huge win for a card that theoretically costs 21% less.\nWinner:AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT\nThese days, picking the right graphics card is more than just looking at what the hardware can do. Both Nvidia and AMD offer an entire suite of software features that further stretch what the graphics card can do.\nThe big selling point for the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti, and really allNvidia graphics cards, is the suite of features that now falls under the DLSS umbrella. This includes things like AI upscaling and Frame Generation, but forDLSS 4, Team Green found a way to expand the latter. Now, with RTX 5000 graphics cards, Nvidia has enabled multi-frame generation, which can use AI to generate three frames for each naturally rendered frame. This greatly improves frame rates, but it does come with a small latency cost – though that’s largely offset by Nvidia Reflex. Just like DLSS 3’s Frame Generation, you’re only going to want to enable this feature if you’re already getting a decent frame rate – at least 45, but ideally more than 60fps.\nAMD also supports Frame Generation, but Team Red GPUs can still only generate one interpolated frame per rendered frame. Instead, the big improvement this time around is FSR 4, which brings AI upscaling to AMD graphics cards for the first time. Before this generation, FSR was based on a temporal upscaling method, which delivers excellent performance but could result in fuzzy images. FSR 4 uses the Radeon RX 9070 XT AI accelerators to upscale the image using a machine learning algorithm, much like how DLSS has worked since 2018. This upscaling method is much more accurate, even though it’s not quite as fast as FSR 4.\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that this is only the first generation of AMD’s AI upscaler, and Nvidia has been training DLSS for seven years now.\nWinner:Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti\nGPU pricing is a hot-button issue right now as pretty much every graphics card of this new generation is completely sold out, with many seeing incredibly inflated prices. The problem is that both Nvidia and AMD set a ‘\"suggested\" retail price for these graphics cards, but then retailers and third-party manufacturers are essentially free to price them however they want to. I can’t predict what GPU prices will look like in six months, but hopefully the prices start falling closer to MSRP once supply catches up with the demand.\nAt its launch price, the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is an absolute triumph. At $599, the 9070 XT is an incredible little 4K graphics card, easily capable of running any game on the market with everything maxed out, provided you use the new FSR 4 AI upscaler. This is the price point flagship graphics cardsusedto launch at before Nvidia started gradually escalating prices, starting with the RTX 2080 Ti. Hopefully this means GPU manufacturers will start returning prices to sanity, but that depends on if prices normalize again.\nNvidia took a different approach with the 5070 Ti, though. While it trades blows with the 9070 XT, it has a base price of $749, a huge $150 price lift. That’s a massive difference between two graphics cards that performextremely similarly.There are a few features that you get by going with a GPU from Team Green, like Multi-Frame Generation, but whether that’s worth it is largely going to depend on what you’re looking for and the games you actually play.\nWinner:AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT\nWhile both the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti are excellent 1440p graphics cards, it’s impossible to escape the fact that AMD is able to trade blows with Team Green’s card at a much lower price. Assuming prices return to normality, the gap between the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and the 5070 Ti makes AMD’s card a clear winner.\nIf you’re looking to build a gaming PC for high-end 1440p gaming, or even want to stretch into 4K, it’s hard to think of a better graphics card to buy right now. Because, sure, the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT doesn’t have multi-frame generation, but most people don’t have the high-refresh 4K gaming monitors that would actually benefit from it.\nJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

    "full_text": "Ludwig is now streaming on Britbox.\n\nActors playing doubles (and even multiples) of themselves onscreen is back in a big way. Robert Pattinson inMickey 17. Robert De Niro inThe Alto Knights. Michael B. Jordan inSinners. Practically everyone onSeverance. Add to this esteemed company English comedian David Mitchell, who appears as identical twins in the delightful mystery comedy Ludwig. Fans of British police procedurals and comedy panel shows rejoice: The Peep Show star and Big Fat Quiz fixture playing a missing detectiveandthe misanthropic puzzle designer impersonating his brother to find out where he went is exactly as fun as it sounds.\nMost of Ludwig rides on the curmudgeonly charisma of Mitchell’s public persona. (It’s not for nothing that he played the stodgy PC inthe UK version of Apple’s “Get a Mac” commercials.) Main character John Taylor (“Ludwig” is the name he self-publishes puzzle books under) is a harrumphing eccentric, bewildered by small talk and apt to go on long tirades berating people for improper joke structure. He putters around crime scenes in a tweed jacket with a pocket full of pens, notebook at the ready. Fortunately, his love of puzzles makes him an unusually astute solver of murders – helpful when you’re trying to convince other people you’re actually detective chief inspector James Taylor of the Cambridge police.\nLudwig’s puzzles themselves are a delight, though you don’t have to understand them in order to enjoy the show. (Source: yours truly, who is terrible at puzzles.) The episodes are structured as if by a Cryptoquip enthusiast Agatha Christie: an impossible crime, a group of suspects, a few red herrings (“false paths” in puzzler lingo), and a monologue at the end where the perpetrator is unmasked. Each one involves some sort of common puzzle type – a code, a logic grid, a hidden acrostic – that eventually leads John towards the correct conclusion. His fellow officers are baffled by his unorthodox methods, but the results speak for themselves.\nLudwig isn’t too concerned with breaking any new ground in the comedy procedural genre, sticking to a conventional case-of-the-week structure and keeping things light. (As light as a show involving homicide investigations and a man, his sister-in-law, and his nephew searching for a missing family member can be.) It’s in the details where the show finds its charms: John, a nerdy loner all his life, finds enjoyment in playacting the role of husband and father to James’ wife, Lucy (Anna Maxwell Martin), and son, Henry (Dylan Hughes). In turn, Lucy and Henry immediately and enthusiastically take to the scavenger hunt for clues to James’ whereabouts, implying he’s a more absent figure in their lives than they’d let on.\nThe well-rounded main cast makes for an unlikely family unit but a great trio of leads, growing closer as the show progresses towards its dramatic finale. It’s just one of the ways Ludwig looks askance at the vast sea of British crime shows, finding new routes into familiar formulas as only a master puzzle-solver could. The guy who calls himself Ludwig may have an exact genetic match out there, but Ludwig the show is a comedy without equal.\nLudwig stars British comedian David Mitchell as a curmudgeonly puzzle setter impersonating his detective twin brother who finds out his puzzle skills make him unusually good at solving murders, and is exactly as fun as that premise would suggest. With a capable cast of supporting characters and a delightfully idiosyncratic trio of leads, the show turns the formulaic British crime procedural on its head in increasingly delightful ways."

    "full_text": "Bethesda has announced that MachineGames’Indiana Jones and The Great Circlelaunches on PlayStation 5 on April 15 for early access ahead of a global release on April 17. Those whopre-ordergetaccess to the early access.\n\nThe PS5 release date, which comes four months after Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launched on Xbox and PC, was announced alongside a playful promo trailer that sees perhaps the two most famous video game actors in the world on-screen together.\nIn the trailer, Indiana Jones actor Troy Baker sits down for a chat with Uncharted star Nolan North, who famously plays intrepid explorer Nathan Drake in the PlayStation-exclusive series. Drake and the Uncharted series are of course heavily inspired by Indiana Jones, so this meeting of the actors who play the characters is a full circle moment for The Great Circle itself.\nThere’s an added layer here, which is the Microsoft-owned Bethesda has drafted in Nolan North, the actor behind the Sony-owned franchise Uncharted, for a chinwag in one of its adverts. Now, at no point does North say ‘Nathan Drake’ or ‘Uncharted’ or anything that might legally belong to Sony Computer Entertainment, but his delivery in the video is knowing indeed.\nDrake — I mean North — playfully suggests he broke into the lavishly decorated room in which he’s sat and so doesn’t have much time to talk. The suggestion here is goons might burst through the door at any moment, as they tend to do when Nate is rummaging through drawers on the hunt for clues.\nNorth asks Baker how he’s going to deal with Private Military Forces with just a whip. Baker points to his head, saying, “use the old—” “headbutt,” North interjects. “I like it. Aggressive.” North says he’s “more of a sidearms kinda guy… jeans… henley,” and, as Baker quips, “somehow always half-tucked.”\nBoth North and Baker then bond over a shared enthusiasm for ancient artefacts, although North wants to sell them to the highest bidder, while Baker wants to donate them to a museum. This is Nathan Drake accepting the new Indiana Jones into a “very exclusive club” of adventurers. “Welcome to the club,” North declares. Xbox’s Indiana Jones now sits proudly alongside PlayStation’s Uncharted on Sony’s console, treasure-hunters in crime. All that’s left is for Lara Croft to break through the window and say something about not wanting the boys to have all the fun.\nThis is all part of Microsoft’s now-established multiplatform push, which has already seen a number of Xbox games launch on rival consoles. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is just the latest to make the jump, with Playground’s Forza Horizon 5, Id Software’s Doom: The Dark Ages and, reportedly, many more Microsoft-made games not far behind.\nBoosted by launching day one on Game Pass, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has so farreached 4 million players— a figure that will no doubt see a significant boost once the PS5 version goes live.\nIndiana Jones actor Harrison Ford has saidTroy Baker playing the beloved character in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is proof \"you don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul.\"\nFord discussed alleviating control of Indy withThe Wall Street Journal, saying he was very happy with the performance of The Last of Us actor Baker.\n\"You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul,\" Ford said. \"You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent. He did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.\"\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Right now, the recently releasedAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DAM5 desktop processor is back in stock on Amazon and Best Buy at its retail price of $479 shipped. This is the official launch price with zero markup, and it's not bundled with anything you don't want or need. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming processor currently on the market (across both AMD and Intel) and a better choice for gamers than the more expensiveIntel Core Ultra 9 285K.\n\nAMD's X3D series processors are optimized for gaming. In that respect, they bench better than even the most expensive of AMD's standard lineup of CPUs thanks to AMD's 3D V-Cache technology.

    "full_text": "A Black Friday deal on one of the best OLED TVs is back. Starting today,AmazonandSamsungare offering the 2024 65\" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV for only $1,399.99 shipped after $1,300 in instant savings. This is anexcellent TV to pair up with your PlayStation 5or Xbox Series X. This TV is considered to as good as or better than the popular LG C4 OLED TV. According toRTINGS, the Samsung S90D is a brighter TV with a wider color gamut, better color volume, wider viewing angle, and better HDR gradient handling.\n\nThe Samsung S90D is the current generation 2024 model. A new \"S90F\" model was announced during CES 2025, but it has yet to be released. This TV is equipped with Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times.\nOLED technology aside, the Samsung S90D also has all the features you'd want in agaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming console. The S90D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to the recently releasedPlaystation 5 Proconsole since it can drive more games in quality mode (native 4K @ 120fps) than the standard PS5, which often needs to be set to performance mode (upscaled 4K).\nIf you're looking for a smaller size, the 42\", 48\", and 55\" models are also on sale. The 42\" model is ideal for PC monitor use. At that screen size, the 4K resolution equates to a respectable 104ppi pixel density and supports chroma 4:4:4 subsampling for clear, legible text. The HDMI 2.1 input supports refresh rates of up to 144Hz over 4K resolution.\nFor this week only, Best Buy is offering the 77\" Samsung S84D 4K OLED smart TV for $1,499.99. That's only $150 more than the 65\" S90D model for a 40% larger screen size. The S84D is Best Buy's exclusive model that's identical to the S85D but with slightly better speakers (30W vs 20W). Compared to the S90D, the S84D is a step down in image quality since it doesn't utilize quantum dot technology and the refresh rate is limited to 120Hz instead of 144Hz. However, it's still an outstanding TV compared to other TVs on the market and an excellent value at this price.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "full_text": "New details about what's in store for the horrors waiting withinSilent Hill fhave emerged, and they make it clear that developer NeoBards Entertainment is keeping in step with the series' tone.\n\nWarning!The following descriptions contain some gruesome details about the content of Silent Hill f, which will entail possible spoilers and mature content.\nKonami airedits latest Silent Hill Transmission broadcast just last week, sharing more details about the upcoming Silent Hill f. Developed by NeoBards, set in a mountain town in 1960s Japan, and written by Higurashi and Umineko author Ryukishi07, Silent Hill f looks to be an interesting new venture for the horror series.\nThe broadcast didn't include much in the way of gameplay though. In lieu of that, fans have been poring over the content warnings and ESRB rating for Silent Hill f, both of which are live and provide some surprisingly detailed descriptions of what terrors wait in the town of Ebisugaoka.\nOver on the ESRB site, Silent Hill f garnered a Mature 17+ rating for \"Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Partial Nudity.\" None of that by itself is terribly surprising, but it's the rating summary that offers some more detail:\nFaces ripped apart, hot irons, and a character sawing off their arm certainly paint a gruesome picture. Silent Hill f could get pretty gnarly, even by Silent Hill's standards. It is, after all,the first game in the series to earn a CERO:Z in Japan, an 18+ rating; the others have typically garnered CERO:C or CERO:D, which are 15+ and 17+, respectively.\nSilent Hill f may also be dealing with some heavy topics and imagery too. For that, we can look at the game's content warning, displayed on boththe official siteand theSteam store page:\nBetween the actual physical horror and tackling these kinds of themes, Silent Hill f certainly seems like it's engaging with the kind of material you'd expect in a Silent Hill. For horror fans, that's hopefully a good sign.\nSilent Hill f has no release date at the moment, though having an ESRB rating this detailed certainly suggests it's not far off. It's currently targeting PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC when it does launch.\nEric is a freelance writer for IGN."

    "full_text": "Activision, Treyarch, and Raven Software have detailed a special Return to Verdansk event and free trial period that will coincide with the launch of the originalCall of Duty: Warzonemap next week.\n\nThe team behind the current iteration of the massively popular military shooter battle royale experience shared everything players could ever want to know about Verdansk’s revival today. Included with a breakdown of all new and returning features, locations, modes, and more was a schedule for the Return to Verdansk event, which includes an ammo crate filled with rewards to earn from launch on April 3 to April 15.\nActivision is calling its limited-time event a “celebration” of the return to the open-world map that started it all. It includes 12 unique zones to explore in Battle Royale and Plunder modes, each with safes to crack and exclusive rewards to obtain. Most goodies come in the form of loading screens, sprays, emotes, finishing moves, etc., but there is a rare chance that your hidden safe will grant access to an Operator skin completely unique to the Return to Verdansk event. Acquiring all 12 rewards also gifts players the freedom to use one of Modern Warfare 2019’s most infamous melee tools: the Kali Sticks.\nThankfully, if you’re the kind of player who can’t sink in the time to loot all 12 safes and try for that rare skin, you’ll be happy to know all players earn six free rewards simply for logging in. They are as follows: Kilo 141 (primary weapon), Domino (Warzone Operator), Mil-Sim USEF (Warzone Operator), Blue Legacy (Contrail for Verdansk Veterans), Coming Home (Parachute for Verdansk veterans), Like We Never Left (Gunscreen for Verdansk veterans).\nCall of Duty: Warzone’s return to Verdansk is more than just a simple retread. The OG map’s reintroduction marks a significant moment for longtime fans and Activision, so it makes sense that the publisher wants to see as many players get in on the fun as possible.\nAs Warzone launches into its most significant seasonal update in years, players will be allowed to access all Premium Black Ops 6 content for 24 hours starting on April 2 at 9:00 a.m. PT. That means unlimited access to Zombies and Multiplayer modes and a whole day to unlock a treasure trove of rewards that can be carried over to Warzone. It’s an access period that launches alongside Season 3 that same day, meaning all trial players can enjoy the full experience of the update at no extra cost.\nThe trade here is that Warzone will be down from April 2 – 3 as the team welcomes Verdansk in and sees Urzikstan out. Once the downtime ends, though, it’s back to Atlas Superstore, Stadium, Gora Dam, and more on console and PC for the first time since 2021.

    "full_text": "A video purportedly taken from the next iteration of The Sims has popped up online, and fans have expressed their concern about what it may mean for the much-loved series.\n\nProject Rene- the codename sometimes used interchangeably with The Sims 5, although EA maintains Project Rene is, in fact, a spin-off project - has been bubbling around for a few years now, but early access footage from a game entitled \"City Life Game With Friends\" has many players thinking that this could well be the next Sims game.\nThe video itselfis a full 20 minutes long and shows the player clicking through text prompts to select their outfit, hair, watch, activities, and so on. He then spawns into a sunlit Plaza de Poupon where he buys some food and mingles with the locals. He later goes to work in the outdoor café.\nCharacters are clearly called Sims throughout the playtest, talk in Simlish, and are adorned with The Sims' tell-tale Plumbob.\n\"I am terribly disappointed with Project Rene. Yes, I know, according to EA, 'this is not the final game.' Is this a joke or what?\"said one unhappy playeron The Sims' subreddit on a post entitled \"I think Project Rene is a redflag (I hope not)\" that has been upvoted hundreds of times.\n\"EA clearly wants to kill off normal Sims games and push people toward the mobile-style experience. So in their mind, a reboot literally means this — at least that’s what I THINK.\"\n\"This is not going to be for me, I can tell already,\" saidanother. \"It just seems so basic and I don't want to play The Sims on my phone.\"\n\"The funny thing is, making a PC/mobile cross-compatible Sims game isn't a bad idea,\"positeda fan. \"EA just believes that mobile games HAVE to be ugly for some reason. They're chasing all of the design trends of the past decade, but it means that this thing already looks dated and it's not even out yet.\"\n\"The way The Sims was a literally [sic] satire about capitalist suburban consumption-as-happiness.... And this is where the Sims ended up.

It's afree-to-playSims game that featuresmultiplayer inspired by Animal Crossing and Among Us. It hasn't yet been formally revealed or received a release date, but EA has been holding small,invite-only playtests for the gamesince its announcement, with the game's latest playtest presumably spawning these recent leaks.\nThe name Rene was chosen because it references words like \"renewal, renaissance, and rebirth\" that \"represent the developer's renewed commitment for the Sims' bright future.\"\nLast October, however,images of Project Rene leakedfrom a closed online test, prompting complaints about the art style, limited features, and the use of microtransactions. It was the addition of a café that drew the most skepticism, primarily due to the smiliaries to 2018's The Sims Mobile. It was then that EA said Project Rene was not The Sims 5 but would, in fact, be a different \"cosy, social game\" released under The Sims franchise.\nDon't forget that The Burglar, a familiar sight for those of us who've spent time with any of the older Sims gamessnuck back into our livesas part of the latest update forThe Sims 4.\nVikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

    "full_text": "With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its wayandits audience.\n\nCapcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.\nBut in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.\n2016 was a bad year for Capcom.\nThe big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.\nThis was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.\nAll of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .\nAchieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.\nCapcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4.\n2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema.\nUnfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.\n“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.\nThis directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op.\nThis downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.\nBut it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.\nThis slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.\nIt was clear something needed to change.\nBy the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability.\nWhile neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.\n“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”\nThose constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6.\n\"We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V,\" Nakayama says. \"And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title.\"\nAll this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards.“There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.\n“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”\nThe team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.\nThere was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master.\n“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.”\nStreet Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series.\nWhile they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.\nWhile Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.\nAround the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience.\n“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”\nIf you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.\n“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”\nItsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance.\nNo other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened.\nFirstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.\n“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”\nMonster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.\nThis created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.\nBut the reality was that Monster Hunterdidhave fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.\nReleased in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.\n“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”\nIt was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”\nIt wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world.\n“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”Tsujimoto says.\nOne important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.\nThis explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.\n“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”\nMonster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call.\n“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&D teams were divided into R&D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”\nTakeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.\nThere were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.\n“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.\nThe game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series.\nBut Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time.\n“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.\nThe result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history.\nNaturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?\nAmpo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”\nBut despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.\nAround the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.\n“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.”\nItsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.\nThe 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. \"Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively,\" Itsuno says. \"When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”\nThis vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should.\nAmpo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, \"So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.”\nThis meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.\n“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”\nSince 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.\nFocusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat.\nBut what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.\nMany of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever.\nWhen asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”\nMonster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”\nMatt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor."

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-soon-integrate-its-copilot-ai-into-the-xbox-app-and-eventually-into-your-xbox-games",
    "full_text": "As a part of Microsoft's ongoing efforts toimplement artificial intelligence into basically everything, the company is preparing to introduce its AI Copilot into your Xbox experience to give you gaming advice, help you remember where you left off last time you played, and perform other tasks.\n\nAnnounced today, Copilot for gaming will be rolled out for Xbox Insiders through the Xbox mobile app sometime soon for testing. If you're not already aware, Copilot is Microsoft's existing AI chatbot (that replaced Cortana in 2023) that's already integrated into Windows. The gaming version will have a handful of features at launch. You can ask it to install games on your Xbox for you (a process you can already do now just by pushing a single button on the app), and you can also ask it about your play history (in case you forgot what you were doing last time you played), achievements, library, or for a recommendation of what to play next. You'll also be able to speak to Copilot for Gaming directly on the Xbox app while you're playing, and it will serve you answers in the same way Copilot currently does when asked questions via Windows.\nProbably the biggest use-cases touted by Microsoft available at launch is Copilot as a gaming assistant. You can already ask Copilot questions about games any time on PC, such as how to beat a boss or solve a puzzle, and it will source answers via Bing from various online guides, websites, wikis, and forums. Soon, you'll also be able to ask it those same questions on the Xbox app.\n\"Our goal is to have Copilot for Gaming source the most accurate game knowledge — so we are working with game studios to make sure the information Copilot surfaces reflects their vision, and Copilot will refer players back to the original source of the information.\"\nUnshockingly, Microsoft does not intend to limit itself to just these Copilot functions. In a press briefing, Microsoft spokespeople discussed other future possibilities for Copilot in video games, including as awalkthrough assistant to explain basic game functions, remember where items where left in a game, or tell you where to find new ones, or as a helper in competitive games that could offer strategy suggestions and tips in real-time to counter opponents' moves, or explain how and why an engagement unfolded the way it did. Though it was emphasized that these were both just ideas they were toying with, the presentation made clear that Microsoft is insistant on finding ways to integrate Copilot closely with regular Xbox gameplay. And Microsoft confirmed to me that it will eventually work with not just first-party studios, but third-party studios for integration into their games as well.\nWith that in mind, I asked Microsoft if Copilot gaming would be opt in or opt out of use, or if users could opt out of having their data used to train it. The answer is that yes, Xbox Insiders can opt out during the preview, but the door was left open for Copilot to be mandatory in the future. Here's what a spokesperson said:\n\"During this preview on mobile, players will be able to decide how and when they want to interact with Copilot for Gaming, whether it has access to their conversation history, and what it does on their behalf.\n\"As we preview and test Copilot for Gaming with players early, we will continue to be transparent about what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices players have around sharing their personal data.\"\nIGN understands that Copilot is not being limited to just player-focused usage, and that Microsoft will be providing an overview on plans for developer use in asession at the Game Developers Conference on Monday next week.\nRebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Instead, the 9950X3D is geared towards gamers that both play games and use creative apps like Photoshop and Premiere, the latter of which sees a 15% performance improvement over the 9800X3D. For a pure gaming PC build, though, you’re probably better off saving that extra $220 for a better graphics card.\"\nAMD's X3D series processors are gaming optimized thanks to AMD's 3D V-Cache technology. However, since all three CPUs have the 3D V-cache loaded onto a single CCD, you get roughly the same gaming performance across all three chips. The minor differences are mostly due to the difference in clock speed. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.2GHz with 8 cores, 16 threads, and 104MB of L2-L3 cache Although perfectly capable of handling multitasking, rendering, and creation, the limited number of cores means they aren't the ideal processors for those tasks. However, this is an absolute monster of a processor for gaming, especially at this price point.\n\"The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is extremely powerful in games, which makes it easier to recommend than other recent processors like the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K or Ryzen 9 9900X. Especially if you’re building a rig with a powerful graphics card, the 9800X3D is going to be the best way to get the most performance out of whichever GPU you pair it with.\"\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D is the processor you'd get if you do creative work and like to game, but you have a budget to adhere to and the 9950X3D crosses that line. The new 9900X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.5GHz with 12 cores, 24 threads, and 140MB of L2-L3 cache. This is the one chip we haven't reviewed yet, but from the specs, it's pretty easy to guess its performance. In terms of productivity tasks and multi-core workloads, it should perform somewhere in between the 9950X3D and 9800X3D. In terms of gaming, we expect it to be a wash compared to the other two.\nIf you decided to hold off onNvidia's Blackwell GPUs to see if AMD's new offeringswere up to snuff, then you made the right choice. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards are the new mid-range champions of this generation. Both cards offer phenomenal performance while undercutting their Nvidia competition in price. The Radeon RX 9070 starts at $550 and the 9070 XT starts at $600 (although it turns out that manufacturers are hiking the price again).

    "title": "Acer Predator X34 OLED Review",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-26T13:00:00Z",

    "full_text": "The world ofOLED gaming monitorsis ever expanding, and it's becoming harder and harder for new models to stand out. But that's exactly what the Acer Predator X34 OLED does thanks to itsdeep-dish curveand immersive gaming experience. Coming in at $1,199 MSRP but frequently available for far less (I found it available at multiple retailers for $850 or under), it's a premium gaming monitor that’s able to deliver an exceptionally immersive gaming experience that many gamers are sure to enjoy. Just prepare for an adjustment period if you plan to use it for productivity.\n\nThe Acer Predator X34 OLED is a 34-inch ultra-wide gaming monitor designed to act as the flagship model for the brand. It comes with premium specs to deliver a fantastic gaming experience and is designed with a gaming-first ethos. It features a deep and immersive curve to create a gaming experience that seems to draw you in. This same quality makes it more challenging to use for productivity, so it won’t be a good fit for everyone, but for pure gaming it promises an exciting and engaging experience.\nThe monitor's on-paper specs are fantastic. Since it uses an OLED panel, it promises deep midnight blacks and a wide dynamic range that's able to reveal detail even in deep shadows. OLED currently offers the best image quality available in gaming monitors, and this most recent generation of panels, as is used here in this display, is less susceptible to burn-in and other drawbacks like text clarity. What you're left with is fantastic contrast, incredible colors, and high peak brightness rated at an impressive 1,300 nits.\nBreaking that down a bit further, the X34 OLED is rated to cover 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut and 100% of sRGB. It features a dedicated sRGB mode for creators, as well DCI-P3 and Rec.709 modes to act as a reference for color-critical work. OLED monitors are well regarded for the richness and vibrancy of their colors, and the X34 is no exception. It comes well-calibrated out of the box, and its colors, while not oversaturated, appear very vivid.\nIts brightness, while rated for 1300 nits, will only hit this in very, very small portions of the screen when running in HDR mode for standard definition content such as normal web browsing. It instead averages around 250 nits, which is relatively dim compared to an equally matched LCD monitor but typical of OLEDs due to power draw and heat. Generally, this is bright enough to use in a well-lit room comfortably, but the monitor should not be placed in direct sunlight.\nThe monitor has an ultra-wide design and measures 34 inches diagonally with a 21:9 aspect ratio. It has the wide equivalent of 1440p resolution, and due to the extra width, requires more GPU power to run effectively. It has a resolution of 3,440 x 1,440 pixels, which puts it in between a traditional 16:9 1440p monitor and 4K in terms of how difficult it is to run. To reach its maximum frame rate, you'll need abeefy GPUor be willing to lower graphics settings in demanding games. Even so, it's a great resolution for a screen of this size and results in a very crisp and detailed picture.\nCheck out more flat-panel options in our guide to theBest Gaming Monitors.\nThe Predator X34 OLED is fantastically responsive. OLED panels are naturally very fast, and Acer rates the monitor with a 0.01ms response time. I lack the tools to accurately test at such a low latency; however, it's typical for OLED panels to measure at 0.03ms, while other gaming monitors might top out at 0.5ms (more commonly, 1ms). This leads to bottomed out input latency, so, in a shooter for example, the clicks of your mouse appear on screen as gunshots measurably faster than IPS, VA, or TN based gaming monitors.\nThe X34 pairs this with a 240Hz refresh rate, meaning that it refreshes the screen 240 times every second. As I alluded to above, it would be very difficult to achieve such a high frame rate in any kind of demanding game, even with the top of the line GPU, unless you are runningDLSSandframe generation. Even if you don't always hit this (it's typically only feasible in esports and very non-demanding games), setting that high refresh rate results in lower input latency overall, so there’s still benefit to leaving that setting enabled. The higher your actual frame rate goes, motion clarity gets progressively better. For competitive games, this monitor is quite good.\nThe X34’s most defining feature is its deep 800R curve. The vast majority ofcurved gaming monitorscome in at 1800R or 1500R, both of which are fairly gentle. An 800R curvature is very pronounced and wraps into your peripheral vision to improve your immersion at the same time, but causes noticeable warping of text and images along its curve. For gaming, this doesn't matter since the wraparound effect is appealing, but for productivity, it definitely takes some getting used to. While some people don't mind it, many find it distracting compared to a shallower curve or even a flat panel.\nThe monitor supports a generous array of connectivity options. There are two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DisplayPort 1.4, and one USB Type-C with DisplayPort that’s also able to supply up to 90 watts of power. There’s also a built-in USB hub that offers two USB Type-A ports and an additional USB Type-C. This hub also acts as a KVM, so you can take connected accessories between hosts with the push of a button. The X34 also includes a headphone jack and sports two 5-watt speakers that get relatively loud and, while not as full-bodied as a separate pair of speakers, are better than most others you’ll find built into a gaming monitor.\nThe monitor also comes with a decent stand that is relatively thin, though it does have two long legs that protrude out to increase its overall footprint on your desk. It offers the ability to adjust height up and down a bit over four inches, tilt from -5 to +15 degrees, and pivot with a range of 15 degrees as well. The assembly is tool-less and easy to do, even if you've never set up your own monitor before. I recommend having an extra set of hands if at all possible to avoid needing to lay the monitor down on its face or risking putting pressure on its very fragile panel.\nThe OSD is straightforward and navigated using a joystick built into the display. It's fairly standard fare at this point with a number of different picture presets based on the genre, as well as the ability to adjust the gamma and saturation settings. It offers a sharpness setting as well as an OLED Care menu to toggle its different protective features on and off. There's also a uniform brightness setting, which limits overall brightness and reduces the fluctuations that occur when expanding full screen content. I didn't find this to be very noticeable, so I left it turned off, but if you're sensitive, the option is there.\nIt's also worth noting that Acer has an installable software suite to control many of these settings called Acer Display Widget. In truth, there are few monitor brands where the configuration software feels like more than an afterthought, and this isn't an exception. Still, you'll find most of your most used options here, so it's an effective alternative if you hate fiddling around with the actual OSD.\nThe Acer Predator X34 OLED is a gaming monitor first and foremost. That works to its benefit, but it can also be a detriment in other areas, like the aforementioned productivity concerns I outlined in the previous section. You also see that manifest in some other ways.\nFor pure gaming, it's great, but you should be prepared to either put a little work in or make a handful of concessions if you plan on using this as your daily driver for both work and play.\nFor starters, though its calibration isn't bad, it's not the most color accurate out-of-the-box, and would benefit from calibration for creative work. Grayscale accuracy measured a Delta E average of 4.78, tending toward the green end of the spectrum. Color accuracy was a bit better with a Delta E average of 3.12. With a calibration run using my SpyderPro colorimeter, I was able to dial that in to an average of 1.21, so it’s possible to get very good results (generally, anything under an average of 2.0 is considered well-calibrated).\nResponse time is excellent with no ghosting whatsoever. I would expect nothing less from an OLED gaming monitor, and particularly one that runs at 240Hz. Testing in the BlurBuster’s TestUFO Ghosting Test, there was no ghosting whatsoever. In-game, it's equally crisp with motion clarity that’s on par with the competition, which is to say: as good as any monitor can be at this point. Now, your skill will need to be equally matched to this level of clarity. Making a headshot mid-spin is still a skill that takes equally matched reaction time, but this removes one more glass ceiling for pro-level play.\nThe experience of daily driving the monitor is going to vary from person to person. As I mentioned before, for productivity, that text warping can be distracting. I tried using it for a bit of everything during my test window, and it's not a monitor I would choose if I was going to be writing or reading. Most of the time I was at my PC for creative work and video editing in particular, it was much better.\nI especially liked it for video editing. The ability to see more of the timeline and have it wrap around visually a bit more made editing more efficient. Though I would be remiss to leave out that this would also be true if the curve wasn't there at all. Simply being able to view more of the timeline at any given point allows that efficiency. The curve just enhances the experience... if it's to your taste.\nAnd that right there is the crux of this monitor. You have to love the curve, and it's not a given that you will, even if you enjoy other less-curved monitors. 800R is deep. It's made to simulate having two curved monitors in surround mode without a bezel in between. If you've been a PC gamer for a long time and have tried this yourself, then you’re likely to feel right at home. If the idea sounds ludicrous, then it's probably best to stick to a shallower curve.\nI fall into that camp, having tried this setup myself only a few years ago. Regretfully, I only had 32-inch curved monitors to try it with, and it dominated not just my desk but what felt like half of my office, and since they were each 1440p, it was extremely difficult to run. It just wasn't practical. But for driving games, flight sims, and even many first-person games like Doom Eternal, it was quite immersive. It can also be pretty darn enrapturing.\nSo I like it. I really like it. It's a perfect fit for games like Microsoft Flight Simulator, but as someone drawn to this type of curvature in the first place, I also find a lot to enjoy with it in other genres too. I found myself scooting closer to the screen than I usually sit in Baldur's Gate 3, so it would occupy more of my peripheral vision. In Battlefield 2042, it felt a bit strange at first, but soon I was immersed in the game, feeling like I had my own wraparound view of the furious fray before me.\nAt least for me. That's the thing. This type of display is so subjective that I could only recommend picking it up blind if you have a return policy you can rely on. The quality of the monitor itself is excellent, but the experience of using it is something you really can't know without trying it or another that’s similar for yourself. If you like it, you'll probably come to downright love it in time. If you don't, you may just find that your expensive new gaming monitor is just plain untenable.\nThe Acer Predator X34 OLED has an MSRP of $1,199. At the time of this writing, I was able to find it on sale for only $799 through Amazon. It can be purchased throughAmazon,Best Buy, andB&H.\nWhether or not the Acer Predator X34 OLED will be the right fit for you is ultimately going to be decided by how much you enjoy its curve. Removing that from the equation, it's a solid, high-performance monitor that offers a great picture and gaming experience. If you prefer something more flat, you’re going to want to look elsewhere. But if a deep curve is what you crave, there’s a whole lot to love."

    "full_text": "It’s been a wild 48-hour news cycle if you follow economics at all, and wilder still if you’re a Nintendo fan.\n\nOn Wednesday, we learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 would cost $450 in the United States, a painfully high price thatanalysts saywas partly due to expectation of tariffs, and partly due to other factors like inflation, competition, and component costs.\nThen, last night, the Trump Administrationannounced wide-reaching 10% tariffson essentially every country, with much higher tariffs on numerous nations such as China, the EU, Japan, Vietnam, Canada, Mexico, and many, many others. In response, Chinaannounced this morninga 34% reciprocal tariff on all U.S. goods. And just hours ago, in the wake of all this, Nintendo announced it would bepostponing Nintendo Switch 2 pre-ordersin the U.S. while it evaluated the impact of tariffs on its console plans.\nIt’s an unprecedented situation for everyone, both within and outside of gaming, and one that analysts, experts, and the general public are still trying to make sense of. Which is why just a short 30 minutes before Nintendo dropped its shocking pre-order news, I was on the phone with Aubrey Quinn, a spokesperson for the Entertainment Software Association, to discuss the impact these tariffs would have on the industry writ large.\nThe ESA, like everyone else, is still trying to figure out how all this is going to play out. Broadly, she says, they have some expectations. They knew tariffs of some sort were coming – both due to Trump’s past actions in his first administration and his repeated discussion of them on the campaign trail. And, once implemented, Quinn says they expected there would be risk of retaliation from other countries like China, as well as even more future tariffs and levies from the U.S. But the jury is still out on how this will ultimately play out.\nWhat the ESA does feel confident saying, though, is that these tariffs will have a negative impact on video games:\n“We really are, at this point, just watching and trying not to have knee-jerk reactions, because we don't think that what President Trump announced this week is the end of the story, but what was announced this week and the tariffs as outlined, we do expect these tariffs will have a real and detrimental impact on the industry and the hundreds of millions of Americans who love to play games,” Quinn says. “And so our goal is to work with the administration, to work with other elected officials to try to find a solution that doesn't damage U.S. industries, U.S. business, but also American gamers and families.”\nWhen Quinn says there will be a detrimental impact, she doesn’t just mean the cost of systems, though she says it’s “hard to imagine a world where tariffs like these don’t impact pricing.” She says consumer spending will also be impacted, which will in turn impact company revenue. If companies see their profits drop, that will in turn impact jobs, as well as investment in research and development, and even what the next generation of consoles looks like. “The entire consumer ecosystem is connected,” she says.\nSo what’s the ESA doing about it? Well, a few things so far, but Quinn acknowledges it’s been difficult to get started. Even though the tariffs didn’t come as a surprise to anyone, she says the Trump Administration hasn’t been back in office for long – really just two months. Trump’s cabinet and administration is almost entirely made up of new people, too, so the ESA hasn’t been able to leverage relationships from his last term in office. And some of them were only appointed weeks ago.\n“But yes, the short answer is we know who the conversations need to be happening with, and we are working on making connections and making sure that they understand that we are eager to work with them to find solutions that this is about public, private sector conversations happening, so we can understand and make sure that they see the impact and the risk of impact to business, to consumers, and really everything that's happening within the US borders,” she concludes.\nQuinn points to the recent news that the ESA had already joined a coalition of trade associations to reach out to U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer and express their concerns prior to the tariff news earlier this week. And they’re asking for meetings with a number of legislations and members of the administration to discuss similar topics.\nIs it working, I ask? Are they being heard?\n“Yes. I can tell you conversations are happening with... I don't want to say every level,” she responds. “I've not met with Trump, right? So I don't want to say every level of government, but certainly we've met with members of the administration. We've met with employees at the White House, we've met with employees at USTR [the office of the United States Trade Representative], so yes, we are having conversations and we're also doing that in partnership with other associations to make sure that... This isn't a video game issue. I represent the video game industry, so I'm very aware of the impact on the video game industry, the potential impact, but it's not a video game industry. This is going to affect all consumer products from food to fashion to electronics.”\nSo what can consumers do about it if they’re concerned? Reach out to their representatives, Quinn responds. Write letters, call, send emails, tweets, whatever it looks like to let their elected leaders know they’re concerned. “I think the more members of government, elected officials, and their staff who hear that their constituents are concerned, the more likely we are to be heard and to potentially make an impact.”\nNintendo announced its hold on Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders due to the tariffs just minutes after our conversation had concluded. When I reached out to Quinn for further comment on that, she said the ESA doesn’t comment on what individual companies will do. But I did mention the Nintendo Switch 2’s already-high pricing at the end of our conversation, and Quinn had this to say:\n“You know what? It's been interesting with media coverage around video games and tariffs because just unfortunate coincidental timing that the Switch [2 reveal] was the same day as President Trump's announcement. There are so many devices we play video games on. There are other consoles, but as I was saying, VR headsets, our smartphones, people who love PC games, if we think it's just the Switch, then we aren't taking it seriously. This is going to have an impact.\n“And even American-based companies, they're getting products that need to cross into American borders to make those consoles, to make those games. And so there's going to be a real impact regardless of company. This is company-agnostic, this is an entire industry. There's going to be an impact on the entire industry.”\nRebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?

    "full_text": "I think today might be the day my wallet throws in the towel. Woot is coming in hot with one of thebest PS5 game dealsI’ve seen all year, and Sony’s decided we’ve all earned a full-blown audio upgrade. Between the markdowns onnoise-canceling headphones,portable speakers, andhome theater gear, it's giving \"treat yourself\" energy with \"I won’t regret this at all\" delusion.\n\nI want at least three of these, but I’m pretending to be financially responsible and only putting two in my cart. If you’ve been eyeballing anything fromhigh-end headphonestosmart display cases for your action figures (I meancollectibles), now’s probably the best time to stop window shopping and start adding to your cart.\nThis Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code \"IFPRZAZ\" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16\" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.\n$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.\nI think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.\nIf you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.\nAt $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.\n$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.\nThis speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.\nCrisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.\nThis speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.\nBass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.\nXM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.\nA wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.\nMy living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.\nI didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.\nThis TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.\nI want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.\nThis one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.\nIf you're searching for your next new game to play,Humble Choice Marchis now live, and this is the perfect bundle to discover something new! This month, Homeworld 3 headlines the bundle, with other PC games like Wild Hearts, Pacific Drive, Zau, and Gravity Circuit also included.

    "full_text": "Rockstar’s new and improved version ofGrand Theft Auto 5isn’t going down well on Steam following its launch earlier in March.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 5 Enhanced, which released on March 4, has a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, with 54% of the 19,772 user reviews flagged as positive.\nTo put that into context, the original GTA 5 on Steam, now unlisted at the request of Rockstar Games and as a result unable to appear in search on Valve's platform, has a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam.\nIn fact, GTA 5 Enhanced is currently the worst user-reviewed GTA on Steam, with its closest competitor for the unwanted crown,Grand Theft Auto III – The Definitive Edition, on 66% positive reviews.\nGTA 5 Enhanced is a free upgrade for GTA 5 on PC that includes sought-after features previously only available in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S versions ofGTA Online— including all the latest vehicles and performance upgrades available at Hao’s Special Works, animal encounters, and access to purchase a GTA+ Membership — along with improved graphics options and faster loading times. All players who currently own GTA 5 on PC can upgrade to this new version for free, with the ability to migrate your Story Mode and Online progress.\nYou’d think that would be a relatively straightforward process, but it appears the account migration isn’t working as intended for many players. Indeed, account migration problems are at the heart of most of the negative reviews flagged as ‘most helpful.’\n“ ‘The GTA Online profile associated with this Rockstar Games account is not eligible for migration at this time,’ ” reported one disgruntled player. “If you think I'm throwing away nearly 700 hours of gameplay on one character so that you can make a few more bucks off me, then you can lick my anal orifice clean.\n“This is an objective downgrade from the ‘old’ version. Gonna pretend this was never released and continue to enjoy Legacy version until the new game comes out when I'm 60.”\n“I'm leaving a negative review mainly due to Rockstar deciding that some accounts should arbitrarily not be able to migrate, and if you ask for help from support, they just say they can't do anything about it,” reads another.\n\"I can't migrate either of my two accounts,\" another negative review reads. \"R* support is completely useless and can't help. With the game being over 10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years old I am sure as hell not going to completely restart all my progress in Online just to get marginally better graphics (if that) and HSW and whatever other minuscule ♥♥♥♥ they added.\"\nDespite these issues, GTA 5 Enhanced remains one of the most-played games on Steam, with a 187,059 peak concurrent player count since launch. But it has sparked concern over the inevitable PC release ofGrand Theft Auto 6, with some PC gamers worrying that Rockstar's struggles with GTA 5 Enhanced could signal launch trouble down the line.\nGTA 6 is planned for launch during the fall of 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only, leaving PC gamers out in the cold. In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstarattempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hitsconsole, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.\nWe’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including Take-Two boss StraussZelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out. Meanwhile,Take-Two has sued online marketplace PlayerAuctions, alleging it contains \"thousands of listings for unauthorized, infringing GTA 5 content – including heavily modified player accounts, in-game assets, and virtual currency – all gained by using hacking software, cheats, and technical exploits.\"\nAnd in other news,Rockstar recently acquiredGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Editiondeveloper Video Games Deluxeand renamed it Rockstar Australia.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "url": "https://br.ign.com/the-first-berserker-khazan/138196/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-e-um-soulslike-intenso-para-o-bem-e-para-o-mal-review",
    "full_text": "Um dos gêneros mais populares e importantes dos videogames na última década foi o soulslike. Encabeçado pela FromSoftware e títulos como Dark Souls, Bloodborne e, mais recentemente, Elden Ring, essa categoria derivada dos RPGs de ação reverbera sucessos há 10 anos. Para embarcar nessa onda, a desenvolvedora Neople e a publicadora Nexon criaram The First Berserker: Khazan, novo soulslike baseado no universo do aqui no Brasil quase desconhecido Dungeon Fighter Online, que deixa as raízes de Dark Souls de lado para se inspirar em Nioh e nos soulslikes da Team Ninja.\nDurante as minhas mais de 35 horas de jogo, pude encontrar muitas qualidades no combate e construção de builds baseadas nos inúmeros itens que podemos combinar, mas me senti extremamente entediado com um level design fraco, uma repetição de inimigos no mínimo esquisita e personagens desinteressantes. The First Berserker: Khazan é um jogo muito intenso para o bem e para o mal, mas consegue demonstrar proeminência naquilo que se propõe a ser: um soulslike desafiador.\nCom uma narrativa um tanto quanto comum em histórias de brucutus em busca de vingança, o jogo segue esse mesmo caminho e nos apresenta Khazan, um poderoso general do império de Pell Los, que é condenado injustamente e exilado para montanhas nevadas por traição ao imperador. No entanto, o acaso do destino faz com que ele seja “salvo” por um espírito maligno que o possui e assim começa uma longa jornada de vingança. A premissa é bastante básica, mas a extensão do universo faz com que a narrativa ganhe camadas de profundidade, embora nenhuma delas consiga tornar o enredo cativante de verdade.\nMesmo com reviravoltas mirabolantes, a trama de traição se mantém clichê do início ao fim e em diversos momentos é sonolenta. Os personagens de suporte também são imemoráveis e apenas uma se destacou para mim entre aliados e inimigos: Elamein. Apesar de o vilão ser bom, ele não sustenta a trama fraca. A história é definitivamente o ponto mais baixo do jogo, mas que não pesa tanto graças ao combate sólido e eficiente – pelo menos na maioria das vezes.\nO ponto de maior destaque e brilho de The First Berserker: Khazan é, sem dúvidas, o combate. Extremamente fluido, veloz, intenso, cheio de variedade de armas e habilidades. O game é um soulslike bastante voltado para o parry, mas não de uma forma semelhante a Sekiro. Aqui, a ausência de escudo obriga você a dominar a habilidade de aparar ataques e de desviar no momento certo, porém a esquiva é curta e muitas vezes é a pior opção para escapar de ataques.\nQuando partirmos para o ataque, no entanto, vemos aqui onde a equipe da Neople depositou grande parte dos esforços. Khazan é como uma mistura de Kratos, o Chosen One de Dark Souls e o Lobo de Sekiro — tudo isso parece confuso, mas quando o controlamos as coisas se alinham. O jogo apresenta três opções de arma: lanças, empunhadura dupla com espada e machado e, por fim, a espada de duas mãos. Na minha gameplay, optei pela lança na maior parte do tempo, afinal, o dano me pareceu mais equilibrado e a velocidade de ataque me satisfez mais.\nO crescimento da jogabilidade é exponencial: no começo temos combos simples e ataques com dardo — semelhante ao arco e flecha. No entanto, conforme aprofundamos a vasta árvore de habilidades de Khazan, as lutas se tornam mais fluidas, sangrentas e polidas de certa forma. Mesmo assim, não pude deixar de observar que em algumas situações a hitbox me pareceu meio confusa e até mesmo problemática, tanto para inimigos quanto para armadilhas do cenário, mas foram casos bem específicos e que não se repetiram.\nOs combos de lança são dinâmicos e se encaixaram perfeitamente na minha gameplay. Consegui acabar com inimigos rapidamente, mas precisamos falar sobre o equilíbrio de dificuldade muito peculiar que o jogo apresenta.\nQuanto às batalhas de chefe, algumas são básicas, desde a música e movimentos do inimigo até as arenas, enquanto outras mostram o potencial do jogo e exigem o uso máximo das mecânicas de The First Berserker. Na minha experiência pessoal, nenhuma delas merece grande destaque, exceto a batalha final que é digna de um grande RPG de ação pela magnitude do combate.\nUm grande destaque do jogo é a criação de builds que se baseia muito nos sistemas de Nioh. É possível ter muito controle dos status do personagem e adaptar Khazan para a sua arma e jogabilidade. Itens do mesmo set concedem bônus conforme você equipá-los e acumular status.\nO único sistema ruim de combate é o de invocações, que não ajudam em nada durante as batalhas de chefe e muitas vezes apenas atrapalham. No entanto, os fantasmas são um bom suporte em lutas rotineiras.\nObviamente, por ser um soulslike, The First Berserker: Khazan possui uma dificuldade acentuada, mas os picos de complexidade em progredir no jogo são… esquisitos. Alguns chefes e mapas iniciais são muito difíceis, enquanto algumas batalhas intermediárias contra inimigos de elite e até mesmo os chefões não apresentam desafio, e, por fim, as batalhas mais avançadas são surpreendentemente fáceis. Isso seria normal caso esses picos de dificuldade fossem parte da progressão que, obviamente, fica menos complexa conforme o avançar do jogo, mas The First Berserker tem uma inconsistência de dificuldade que, a meu ver, mostra uma falha de balanceamento no jogo que empobrece a experiência.\nUm dos maiores destaques da FromSoftware em Dark Souls é o mapa minuciosamente conectado que possui atalhos e conexões que exploram a sagacidade dos designers em produzir essas fases. Infelizmente, por optar em se inspirar na Team Ninja e jogos como Nioh e Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, o level design de The First Berserker: Khazan se perde em diversos momentos.\nApesar de contar com áreas vastas e alguns atalhos, muitas regiões do mapa parecem sem vida ou possuem conexões um tanto quanto sem sentido que seriam melhores apenas colocando outra espada da fenda, a “bonfire” do game, para tornar a ligação entre áreas dos biomas mais inteligentes. O jogo poderia olhar mais para Lies of P e criar um level design muito melhor, mas se inspirou justamente em soulslikes com design de mapa problemáticos.\nA má qualidade do level design se alinha à repetitividade de inimigos, aspecto ainda mais evidente quando olhamos para as missões secundárias, que reutilizam esses cenários com pequenas mudanças e tornam o jogo cansativo ao longo do tempo.\nThe First Berserker: Khazan é intenso para o bem e para o mal. Quando o jogo está imerso em seu combate, criação de builds e algumas batalhas de chefe, ele brilha e muito, quase alcançando a prateleira dos ótimos soulslikes. Contudo, o level design ruim, repetição de inimigos, história sonolenta e dificuldade inconsistente fazem ele cair de patamar e ser só mais um soulslike, embora ainda figure entre os bons títulos do gênero, não mais do que isso. Os amantes de Nioh e de jogatinas difíceis encontrarão muita diversão em mais de 35 horas de campanha."

    "full_text": "Helldivers 2has a new patch that makes key balance changes and bug fixes to Sony's third-person co-op shooter.\n\nPatch 01.002.200 tweaks the balance on a number of weapons and stratagems. Developer Arrowhead also increased the number of AI calculations the game can perform, which primarily impacts scenarios with a high number of spawned enemies, improving their response times in those situations. However, this comes with a slight trade-off in game performance, Arrowhead said.\nThe upshot of these gameplay changes is that the Automatons specifically will present a tougher challenge as they now have increased reaction speed in large groups. Expect Helldivers 2's already imposing bots to act smarter and make decisions faster.\nAnd here’s a useful improvement: the stratagem loadout menu has undergone an updated categorization of the different stratagem groupings.\nMeanwhile, publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment announced Helldivers 2’s next Warbond, called Borderline Justice. The theme this time is 'space cowboy,' and in keeping with that theme there are new weapons including the R-6 Deadeye lever-action hunting rifle, the LAS-58 Talon \"revolver\" secondary, and the TED-63 Dynamite.\nThe GS-17 Frontier Marshal is space cowboy-themed medium Helldiver set, as is the GS-66 Lawmaker heavy armor, which comes complete with cowboy holster and bandolier. The Gunslinger armor passive gives your secondary increased reload speed, increased draw/holster speed, and reduced recoil. The warbond launches March 20.\nHelldivers 2’s ongoing Galactic War is currently focusing on the Illuminate alien faction,which is slowly pushing a black hole towards Super Earth. Where this is going is anyone’s guess, but speculation points to potentially taking the fight to the Illuminate’s home world, or maybe finally fighting back on Super Earth itself.\nPrimary weaponsSMG-32 Reprimand\nSG-8S Slugger\nAR-23C Liberator Concussive\nR-63 Diligence\nMP-98 Knight\nSTA-11 SMG\nSMG-37 Defender\nSMG-72 Pummeler\nAR-23 Liberator\nSTA-52 Assault Rifle\nBR-14 Adjudicator\nAR-61 Tenderizer\nR-36 Eruptor\nStratagems\nEagle 110MM Rocket Pods\nEXO-45 Patriot Exosuit\nEXO-49 Emancipator Exosuit\nTX-41 Sterilizer\nM-105 Stalwart\nMG-206 Heavy Machine Gun\nEnemies:\nBarrager Tank Turret\nSettings:\nResolved Top Priority issues:\nCrash Fixes, Hangs and Soft-locks:\nWeapons and Stratagems\nSocial & Multiplayer Fixes\nMiscellaneous Fixes\nTop Priority:\nMedium Priority:\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "full_text": "Update 2:30pm PT:Wizards of the Coast has issued a statement on the DMCA from earlier today, saying that it happened in error and apologizing for the situation:\n\n\"The Baldur’s Village DMCA takedown was issued mistakenly – we are sorry about that,\" the statement reads. \"We are in the process of fixing that now so fans and the Stardew community can continue to enjoy this great mod!\"\nAt the time of this update,the mod was still under review, but it seems likely this will be rectified shortly.\nOriginal story continues below:\nWizards of the Coast has issued a DMCA takedown notice on a fan mod of Stardew Valley that adds Baldur's Gate 3 characters, despite the mod previously having been publicly praised by Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke. And now, Vincke has responded to the takedown as well.\nAs reported by PC Gamer, the mod in question is entitled \"Baldur's Village\" and incorporates Baldur's Gate 3 characters into Stardew Valley. The modreleased earlier this month, and shortly after, Vincke took to Twitter to praise it, saying \"So much love went into this - amazing work!\"\nUnfortunately, just weeks later, the mod is gone. According to a Nexus Mods spokesperson speaking t PC Gamer, Dungeons & Dragons and Baldur's Gate IP holder Wizards of the Coast has issued a DMCA takedown of the mod. \"Hopefully, this is an oversight from WotC, who often use external agencies to hunt down violating content, and they will revert their decision,\" said the spokesperson. \"Fingers crossed for Baldur's Village.\"\nThen, just today, Vincke commented on the situation again on Twitter, once again expressing support for the mod while acknowledging that IP protection is tricky:\nProtecting your IP can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled. There are good ways of dealing with this.\n\"Free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth,\" he said. \"Imho they shouldn't be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property. Protecting your IP can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled. There are good ways of dealing with this.\"\nIt's possible this is part of a larger crackdown from Wizards of the Coast around Baldur's Gate. As we learned at the Game Developers Conference earlier this month, we're supposedly going to hear more about what the company has planned for the IP \"in pretty short order\", so maybe this free Stardew Valley mod was somehow in conflict with that. Or maybe it was a mistake that will quickly be rectified. We've reached out to Wizards of the Coast for comment.\nRebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Others, like theSonic statueandRimWorld deal, are more like little bonus treats for the fans. Either way, if you’ve been waiting for a solid sale on a gaming monitor, a high-end phone, or a storage upgrade, Samsung has something worth looking at today.\nAliExpress has brand new PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch OLED consoles on sale for prices you won't find anywhere else. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming console that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by youraccount, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item.\nI want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.\nThis phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.\nI didn’t know I needed an 11-inch Sonic statue until now. The detail is impressive, the LED lights make it pop, and it’s half off. If you’re a Sonic fan, this is an easy yes. If you’re not, well, now’s a great time to start.\nI can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.\nRimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.\nThis SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.\nI never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.\nI think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.\nApple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.\nBeats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art. The remastered soundtracks, modernized UI, and quality-of-life improvements bring these classics into the modern age while keeping their original charm intact. Each game features iconic character designs by Kazuko Shibuya and a faithful soundtrack rearranged by Nobuo Uematsu. Whether you’re reliving the golden age of RPGs or playing them for the first time, this bundle is the ultimate way to experience Final Fantasy’s roots. The limited-time sale price of $52.49, down from $74.99, makes this an easy win for any RPG fan.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experience Final Fantasy I through VI in glorious HD pixel art.

Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.\nIf you’re tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.\nWhy buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.\nIf you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.\nStill using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.\nThese aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.\nThese Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.\nLuxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.\nThis isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.\nFor those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says \"powerful Pokémon\" like an angry robot penguin).\nI'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.\nIf somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.\nYour PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).\nIf you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, \"I really need to delete some games,\" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.\nLogitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.\nSamsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room. The Acoustic Lens Subwoofer ensures deep, punchy bass, while Adaptive Sound and Game Mode Pro make sure everything from dialogue to explosions sounds crisp. At $764 off, this is the cheapest we’ve seen it outside of Black Friday.\nLG B4 OLED TVbrings incredible picture quality at a price that doesn’t require selling a kidney. It features Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, an α8 AI Processor that automatically enhances whatever you’re watching, and LG’s latest webOS for easy access to streaming apps and over 300 free LG Channels. Gamers get Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and VRR, plus four HDMI 2.1 ports. At $499.99, this is one of the best deals for an OLED right now.\nSamsung’s S90D OLED TVis a beast, packing AI-powered 4K upscaling, Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for silky smooth gameplay, and Dolby Atmos for immersive sound. Real Depth Enhancer makes everything look more lifelike, and PANTONE validation ensures accurate color reproduction. At $300 off, this is a great price for a high-end 65” OLED TV.\nSony’s WH-CH520 headphonesoffer 50 hours of battery life, customizable sound settings, and a lightweight, comfortable design. Multipoint connection makes switching between devices seamless, and DSEE upscaling improves compressed audio. At just $35.95, these are one of the best budget wireless headphones out there today.\nGoogle’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 bring top-tier noise cancellation, a Tensor A1 chip for AI-powered audio enhancements, and large 11mm drivers for rich bass. Conversation Detection automatically switches to transparency mode when you talk, so you don’t have to take them out. If you need premium wireless earbuds, this is asolid deal for these 9/10 buds.\nEnshrouded is a survival RPG with deep crafting, intense combat, and massive co-op potential. Play solo or team up with up to 16 friends, build custom bases, and fight through a dark, mysterious world. It’s still in early access, but at $23.99, it’s worth jumping in now aswe gave it 8/10.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

    "title": "10 Ways Switch 2 Is Better than Switch",

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/10-ways-switch-2-is-better-than-switch",
    "full_text": "Rejoice, fellow Nintendo fans. On Wednesday, the clouds parted, the sun rose, and the divine spectra; hand of Miyamoto reached down from the sky to grace us with Nintendo’s newest handheld carnival of joy, the Switch 2. After years of speculation, we finally have a clear look at the mysterious console hybrid.\n\nSadly, while sleek, compact, and powerful, the rumours are untrue. The Switch 2 does not in fact pack a tiny little Reggie into every GPU. But after we spent an hour during the Direct glued to every word: dissecting it, screenshotting every image, poring over captured video for tiny clues to its form and function, we can finally apply something besides guesswork and give you some solid facts, including all the ways it leaves its beloved predecessor in the dust.\nThis is probably the least-surprising revelation as practically every next-gen Nintendo console has been significantly improved over its predecessor (yes, even the Wii). Still, when released in 2017, Switch was hardly a cutting-edge powerhouse in comparison to Sony and Xbox consoles, and eight years later it noticeably struggles under demanding games. Nintendo and its partners were increasingly running up against the limitations of the hardware.\nThis week we saw elements on display promising us a vastly improved experience: handheld resolutions up to 1080p, docked up to 4K, both with HDR, and framerates extending up to 120 fps. It’s a welcome upgrade that should allow a wider variety of games to come to Switch 2. We may already see some of the fruit in EA’s decision to host soccer and football games on Switch 2, and 2K’s intention to do the same with wrestling and basketball.\nThird parties revealed all manner of current-gen games to give us some idea of the Switch 2’s increased capabilities, and what we saw was encouraging: a console/handheld capable of handling Elden Ring, Street Fighter 6, and other demanding software. And what Nintendo showed of their new first-party offerings was simply gorgeous.\nThe little purple lunchbox that could finally comes to Nintendo Switch Online, exclusively available on Switch 2. Nintendo has effectively drawn a fence between online experiences on Switch and Switch 2, and that means that from this point forward those who want to play some of Nintendo’s best retro games are going to have to shell out for better hardware. Sure, it’s only three games right now, but those three games are absolute bangers: The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and, holy crap, Soul Calibur 2, complete with Link.\nOkay, seriously. Soul Calibur 2 is incredible. If you’ve never played it with a friend you are in for such a treat.\nWhen humanity later reviews and catalogues the glorious day in video game history, the opening chapter won’t be about how Mario Kart is now like Forza Horizon, or about Donkey Kong’s return in Bananza, or even about the announcement of the until-now secret project called Duskblood. Instead, the book will open and perhaps also close with the most significantly un-Nintendo thing to happen this week: easy integration of online features commonly available on other platforms.\nThe company that brought us Friend Codes now graces us with GameChat, a feature-rich communication and visual sharing feature set for Switch 2. A noise-cancelling mic picks up your voice and shares it with friends. An optional desktop camera allows you to share your face, both in window-corners and in compatible games like Mario Party. You can also share screens across consoles remotely. It’s much of what we gave up on asking Nintendo for years ago... a simple, straightforward tool for playing with friends. I’m looking forward to seeing how it actually plays out.\nSo much potential awaits with this feature. Where my mind keeps going is Monster Hunter, with teams of four benefitting from shared screens as they pursue and trap their prey. It’s simply become unthinkable for Nintendo to voluntarily offer fans such a useful array of online features, but here we are living in the future at last.\nOkay, we’d already guessed this but it’s still really cool. Joy-Cons now magnetically snap to the Switch 2 body rather than slotting in. Nintendo showed off how the steel shoulder buttons on each controller attract to the magnetic facing along the sides of the screen, locking them together. A press of a button releases the magnetic grip.\nThis is a pretty great feature for my home setup, where a shelf top obstructs removing the Joy-Cons without removing the entire Switch from the dock, which sometimes leads to knocking the whole thing down. I’m a fan.\nBigger isn’t always better with handhelds, but given the sharper resolution of the 1080p portable screen and the nature of most Switch games, the slight increase in size to 7.9 inches should be a net gain for most players. The first Switch sacrificed screen real estate for portability but I think Nintendo is making the right call in giving these elaborate, feature -rich games more space to shine.\nNintendo was weirdly excited to show off its innovative Joy-Con mouse features. A Switch 2 Joy-Con laid on its side can be scooted across a tabletop, and its telemetry tracked to provide precise pointing and rotation. It looks to be heavily-supported at launch by games like Drag x Drive, Civ 7, and Metroid Prime 4.\nI do love wacky Nintendo. My guess is the mouse feature won’t see much use past launch window (much like the microphone on the old DS) but I’m actually 1000% in on playing Metroid Prime 4 with a mouse. As a PC gamer, I rarely enjoy FPS games that force me to use a controller, so this surprising option feels a bit liberating. Hopefully we get Mario Paint 2.\nThis one is more of a double-edged sword. Nintendo crammed the Switch 2 with 256GB of external storage, much more than the original Switch. But with all the Switch 2’s extra graphics capacity, those asset-rich game files are going to be much bigger too, so it may be close to a wash. The memory is quicker as well to deal with larger game files, which means you’ll need a new, faster memory card for your supplemental storage.\nNintendo tweaked the Switch hardware in response to nearly a decade of feedback. Switch 2 now features two USB-C ports, with one added on top to assist in charging while playing in kickstand mode. Nintendo added a fan to the doc to aid in cooling consistency. Sticks are larger and sound capabilities are improved.\nEven the Switch 2 Pro Controller is a step up, with an audio jack (at last!) and assignable buttons. No telling yet if the new controller contains the same miniaturized star that exists at the core of every Switch Pro Controller, giving it near-unlimited battery life.\nAnd one of the most subtle features might be most useful. I do a fair bit of Switch playing on my tabletop. The fact that the Switch 2 screen angle is adjustable in kickstand mode is a huge deal for me. Too often, ambient light at an airport or the angle of a tight airplane tray table make playing in kickstand seem like an exercise in futility. But with the ability to subtly shift angles, coupled with the new mouse feature, leads me to believe I might actually be able to enjoy a serious game of Civilization 7 on the go.\nSo first off, Switch 2 is backward compatible. That’s always good. Microsoft has already blazed a pretty amazing trail toward optimized backward compatibility on Xbox, and Nintendo has also wisely taken a note from its own Gamecube to Wii to WiiU history, making most Switch games a snap to play on new hardware. Backward capacity helps sell consoles their first year.\nWhile the Nintendo Switch 2 is backward compatible with Switch games, it also supports special new Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of certain Switch titles like Metroid Prime 4. These enhanced titles offer new features including a selection between a higher-res Quality Mode or a faster frame rate in Performance Mode.\nOne really cool feature of these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions is that if you already own the original game on Switch, you will be able to purchase a simple Switch 2 Edition upgrade and enjoy all the new features on your new hardware.  Let's hope it's not too expensive.\nIt’s also possible that Switch 2 Editions of Switch’s notoriously-janky Pokemon games could be improved by these features. Let's hope so. Throwing hardware at things can’t solve every problem but sometimes it really helps.\nMario Kart World does everything we expect of Mario Kart and adds two key elements. The first is the ability to traverse a continuous world Forza Horizon-style, racing from course to course, free mode exploring, fooling around, and so on. The second is the swelling of the field size to 24 carts, which is, well, a lot to get one’s head around when the shells start flying. It sounds like absolute bedlam. I can’t wait.\nNintendo took its time showing off new games but toward the end of the show we bought about a minute tease of a new Kirby’s Air Ride game, Kirby’s Air Riders, an announcement that would likely have resulted in a thunderous snooze were it not for the surprising involvement of one Mr. Sakurai, known equally for his self-immolating work ethic and his status as god of Smash Bros. I love Kirby, but Air Ride sucked... BUT it’s Sakurai so I’m now 100% in.\nThen there was The Duskbloods, a trailer that produced some hysterics in me. At first I thought it was Bloodborne 2, then I thought it was a licensed FROM Software take on Castlevania, and then finally I accepted that what I was seeing was an entirely original Miyazaki game exclusive to Switch. My friends, remember: FROM Software does not miss. Probably you will die. Probably you will dodge roll. Certainly you will have a blast.\nAnd of course; the real King of Kong makes his triumphant return to 3D with Donkey Kong Bananza. It’s a moment of absolution for Nintendo: 26 years after dropping the barbequed turd Donkey Kong 64 on an unsuspecting planet, a wiser, more skilled Nintendo has returned to the drawing board with what’s sure to be a landmark adventure.\nNintendo devs have been absolutely murdering 3D platforming on the Switch, not just with Odyssey and Bowser’s Fury, but also with Kirby’s incredible journey to the shores of the Forgotten Lands. Bananza was constructed to showcase far more capable hardware than these modern-day classics, which means that the devs had opportunities to iterate on ideas that wouldn’t have been possible on a basic Switch.\nJared Petty is a former IGN editor who likes writing about how wonderful and silly video games are.

    "full_text": "Gaming hardware company ASUS has pulled back the curtain at what may be the reported Xbox-branded handheld device.\n\nThe ASUS Republic of Gamers X/Twitter account shared ateasershowing its \"little robot friend cooking something up,\" offering a brief glimpse at both a Republic of Gamers (ROG) Xbox controller and handheld system.\nLast month, IGN reported on Microsoft’s video game hardware ambition, which allegedly includes a full next-gen Xbox for 2027 and anXbox-branded gaming handheld that may launch later in 2025.\nThat's not our only clue, either. The handheld shown in ASUS's teaser clearly shows off buttons configured for Xbox (Y, B, A, and X, rather than PlayStation's triangle, circle, cross, and square, or Nintendo's X, A, B, and Y). There's also a D-pad, two thumbsticks, and four smaller additional buttons, although it's pretty hard to make those out clearly.\nPerhaps most interestingly of all, though, the official Xbox accountacknowledged the tweetwith a cheeky wide-eyed gif, suggesting this is all setting up a reveal.\npic.twitter.com/ONZpeEmNka\nUnfortunately, that's all we have. There's no date on the reveal yet, let alone a concrete launch window, but the monitor the little robot is working on states \"Marathon stamina, more capacity, faster speeds\" and \"fresh look!\" giving us an idea of what the handheld's unique selling points may be.\nIn January, Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s VP of ‘Next Generation,’ toldThe Vergethat the company plans to combine Xbox and Windows experiences together for PC gaming handhelds made by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), otherwise known as third-party hardware manufacturers. Existing PC gaming OEMs include ASUS, Lenovo, and Razer.\nWhile this Xbox-branded gaming handheld is not a Microsoft-made console, the company is reportedly planning to finally launch one of its own in 2027, potentially alongside its next-gen Xbox.Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer recently indicated a first-party Xbox handheld is years away.\nSpeaking of which, the successor to the Xbox Series X is now allegedly \"fully\" in production and due out in two years, tying in with Xbox president Sarah Bond's recent comments thatMicrosoft was \"moving full speed ahead on our next generation hardware, focused on delivering the biggest technological leap ever in a generation.\"\nFor some time now, there's been much speculation around the future of consoles, with Netflix's President of Games, Alain Tascan, recently stating that he expectsa future generation that relies less on gaming consolesdespite major players like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo pushing forward with new hardware. The latter'shighly anticipated Switch 2 devicewill be showcased in a Nintendo Direct on April 2, with many fans expecting to hear more aboutwhat features the Switch 2 brings to the table, its release date, andhow pre-orders will be managed.\nVikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

    "full_text": "Amazon quietly restocked a bunch ofPokémon TCG bundles just days agoand stock is already running low. These Scarlet & Violet sets have been MIA for weeks, and now they’re back at retail prices. I already added a couple to my cart,Surging SparksBooster Bundle,Shrouded FableETB and Paldean Fates Booster Bundle. Trainers need to snap these up quick. If they’re gone by the time you get there, that’s on you.\n\nLooking for the least expensive PlayStation 5 console you can your hands on? As part of its US Anniversary Sale, AliExpress is offering an importedSony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Editiongaming console for $367.94 shipped after $80 off coupon code \"MAYUE008\". This is a brand new and retail boxed product that is stocked in a US warehouse and qualifies for local delivery, which means it ships free and arrives within about 1-2 weeks.\nI also spotted a couple of power banks on sale from INIU and Anker. If you’ve ever watched your phone die mid-flight or mid-text, you know why I’m excited. These things are cheap, fast, and less annoying than asking strangers for a charger at an airport. Do with that information what you will. Oh, and while we’re on the topic of things I absolutely don’t need but definitely want: theGamera: Attack of Legionaction figure is up for preorder at the IGN Store for a cool $560, and Humble Bundle just dropped a massiveDragonlance book bundlethat practically dares you to add 25+ fantasy novels to your backlog for the price of lunch.\nI want this bundle purely for the thrill of cracking six packs in a row and pretending I’m building a deck for Worlds. The Surging Sparks expansion is still new enough to feel fresh, and at $45.02, it’s a decent value compared to scalper prices that make you question your financial decisions. If you just want to dip into the latest set without going full collector mode, this is it.\nShiny Pokémon are back, and apparently so is my addiction to them. The Paldean Fates bundle gives you six chances to pull something sparkly, and while $69.94 isn’t exactly pocket change, I think the potential dopamine hit is worth the gamble. It’s in stock, it ships fast, and I’ve made worse choices at 2 a.m. on eBay.\nI’m not saying this is the nerdiest thing you can buy today, but it’s definitely on the leaderboard. Humble Bundle just dropped a massive Dragonlance collection; 25+ books for about the cost of lunch. If you’ve ever wanted to get lost in magical twin drama, cursed artifacts, or the politics of dwarves (because who hasn’t), this is your sign. Plus, part of your purchase supports Room to Read, so now your TBR pile can come with good karma.\nIn my opinion, this is the one to grab if you're all-in on the set. Nine booster packs, a Pecharunt promo, themed sleeves, dice, and an actually-useful storage box? For $54.96? I’ve spent more on less at Taco Bell. Plus, it's still Prime eligible, which means you don’t have to sell your soul for free shipping. Win-win.\nThis is what happens when you give kaiju collectors exactly what they want: a 9.5-inch figure of LEGION fromGamera 2, complete with flying parts, glowing bits, and articulation that would make Spider-Man jealous. Sure, it’s $560, but I’ve seen statues half as cool go for double that. If you’re the kind of person who rearranges shelf space for something before buying it, I totally get it.\nThis thing charges your phone like it’s got something to prove. At $26.98, it gives you a full week’s worth of backup power and a built-in flashlight just in case you drop your phone and your dignity under your car seat. I want it purely because it has an LED readout that makes me feel like I’m operating a mission control panel instead of just charging my AirPods.\nI think this is the best deal of the day, and not just because it’s $17.99. It’s slim, light, and can survive a drop better than my will to stay off social media. Anker knows what it’s doing, and this charger just works. No random overheating, no mystery ports, just plug it in and keep scrolling through whatever app is currently ruining your sleep schedule.\nHulu + Live TVoffers a three-day free trialthat allows you to take the live TV streaming service for a spin. This is one of the overallbest streaming free trialsbecause it gets you a bundle of services. It is quite a bit shorter than the standard Hulu free trial of 30 days, but it's a great way to test it out over the weekend.\nWith a 240Hz refresh rate, Dual QHD resolution, and 0.03ms response time, this 49-inch ultrawide OLED is built for high-performance PC gaming. The 1800R curve and HDR True Black 400 make it incredibly immersive, while FreeSync Premium Pro helps keep gameplay smooth and responsive.\nThis Android tablet comes with an S Pen included, a 10.4-inch display, and Samsung DeX for multitasking. At under $200, it’s a solid pick for casual gamers, students, or anyone who wants a lightweight, entertainment-ready tablet with productivity perks.\nCelebrate Women's History Month with a killer bundle featuring female-led games. Titles include Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, Control: Ultimate Edition,Darksiders III,Beyond: Two Souls, and more. It’s a $160+ value for just $12, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity.\nWith a whopping 10,000Pa of suction, self-refilling, self-emptying, sonic mopping, and even hot-air mop drying, the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra takes hands-off cleaning to the next level. It's packed with AI features and even supports pet tracking and video calls.\nAmazon’s newest Kindleadds color to the mix with a 7\" Colorsoft display. It still lasts up to 8 weeks on a single charge and now supports wireless charging and full-color highlights. It's ideal for reading graphic novels, cookbooks, or anything where visuals matter.\nEnjoy spatial audio, active noise canceling, and up to 40 hours of battery life. These over-ear headphones are compatible with both iOS and Android, and support lossless audio over USB-C. A strong option for commuters, creators, and music lovers.\nThis Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code \"IFPRZAZ\" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16\" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.\n$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.\nI think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.\nIf you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.\nAt $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.\n$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.\nThis speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.\nCrisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.\nThis speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.\nBass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.\nXM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.\nA wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.\nMy living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.\nI didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.\nThis TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.\nI want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.\nThis one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

Finding multiple Apple deals, plus discounts on Zelda and Final Fantasy collectibles? It's my gamer-tech jackpot. Right now, you can save onAirPods Pro 2, grab aMagSafe leather case for just $11.99, and even score afour-pack of AirTags for under $70.\n\nIf you’re in the market forwireless earbuds,power adapters, or anApple Watchband, there are plenty of options at all-time low prices. And you know by now I like to pop in some really cool gaming stuff. How about a full-sizedMaster Sword replicathat plays Zelda music when you swing it and aFinal Fantasy I-VI bundlethat brings the pixel-perfect RPG classics back to life?\nUpgrade your tech, complete your Zelda shrine, or relive Final Fantasy’s golden era, these deals are worth checking out. Some discounts like the iPhone 14 Plus MagSafe case, are downright ridiculous at 80% off. But Apple deals never last long (Tim Cook loves that Apple tax), and limited collectibles definitely sell out fast. If something catches your eye, now’s the time to add to cart before the price jumps back up.\nAliExpress is offering this Arzopa 15\" 1080p USB Type-C portable monitor for only $57 shipped after you apply coupon code \"IFPQHLH\". We've posted deals on this portable monitor in the past, but this is the lowest price we've seen thus far. The marketplace vendor is Arzopa itself so you're getting the full manufacturer's warranty on this brand new, retail packaged item. This monitor is primarily designed to be a secondary display for a laptop, but the S1's 1080p 60Hz panel is a great match for the Nintendo Switch's hardware, since the Switch only supports up to 720p @ 60Hz anyway.\nFor only $22 more, you can upgrade to the higher end Arzopa Z1FC USB portable monitor, now only $79.19 after coupon code \"IFPQHLH\". It's currently $117 on Amazon. The Z1FC's upgrades include a larger display (16.1\" vs 15.6\"), a higher refresh rate (144Hz vs. 60Hz), and better color reproduction (100% sRGB color gamut). This is a better monitor than the S1 to pair with the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally because both gaming handhelds can support refresh rates up to 144Hz.\nApple’s best earbuds are now $50 off.

Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.\nStill using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.\nThese aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.\nThese Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.\nLuxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.\nThis isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.\nFor those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says \"powerful Pokémon\" like an angry robot penguin).\nI'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.\nIf somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.\nYour PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).\nIf you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, \"I really need to delete some games,\" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.\nLogitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.\nSamsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room.

    "title": "Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 Mobile Review",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-27T13:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-mobile-review",
    "full_text": "TheNvidia GeForce RTX 5090launched back in January and easily became the most powerfuldesktop graphics cardon the market. Now, a few months later, Nvidia has launched its Blackwell architecture for laptops, and while these mobileNvidia GPUsare nowhere near as powerful as their desktop counterparts, they do deliver an incredible gaming experience, especially on high-end gaming laptops with high-refresh displays.\n\nHowever, just like Nvidia’s latest line of desktop graphics cards, the generational improvement in pure performance isn’t nearly as pronounced as it’s been in previous generations. That’s offset a bit in games that support features like Multi-Frame Generation, of course, but it does mean that anyone who already has a decent gaming laptop doesn’t need to sweat upgrading their setup for this new generation.\nWhile the GPU in the Razer Blade 16 I tested is called an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, it’s a far cry from the desktop version of the GPU with the same name. Just by virtue of space and thermal constraints, the mobile version of the RTX 5090 needs to be much smaller: Instead of the 21,760 CUDA cores in the desktop version of the card, the mobile 5090 is limited to 10,496 cores across 82 Streaming Multiprocessors. That’s less than half the silicon, and places the RTX 5090 mobile closer to the desktop RTX 5080.\nBut it’s more than just the size of the chip – laptops are a lot more power-constrained than a desktop, too, by virtue of needing to operate on a battery or via a portable power brick. The system I tested the RTX 5090 Mobile with had the GPU limited to 160W, which is a little over aquarterof the power of its desktop counterpart. That has a huge impact on gaming performance, since a general rule of thumb is that more power = better performance.\nHowever, compared to the previous-generation Razer Blade 16 with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, the new mobile chip has been beefed up a bit. The RTX 4090 packed 9,728 CUDA cores across 76 Streaming Multiprocessors, at the same 160W power budget. That’s about a 7.4% increase in the amount of cores, which is a minor increase, but it lines up extremely well with the performance increase you can expect from the RTX 5090.\nKeep in mind, though, that with laptop graphics, it’s largely up to the laptop manufacturer how much power and cooling a GPU has access to. There may be some gaming laptops with an RTX 5090 configured to run with as little as 95W. The laptop I tested had it configured for 160W, which is above the maximum listed TGP (total graphics power) specified by Nvidia. The point is, your mileage may vary, as a 95W RTX 5090 is going to be much weaker than one running on 150W.\nEach Streaming Multiprocessor is architected a bit differently than the RTX 4090 too. Just like the desktop version, the RTX 5090 Mobile is based on the new Blackwell architecture, which places special emphasis on AI computation – after all this is the same architecture powering most cutting-edge supercomputers right now. The new Tensor Cores, combined with a new AI Management Processor, or AMP, allow the GPU to do much more complex AI workloads, and is the driving force behind multi-frame generation.\nNvidia has also made an effort to improve battery life, which has never been a strong point for gaming laptops. It’s done this by improving Nvidia Optimus, a technology that dynamically switches between discrete and integrated graphics depending on what you’re doing. But Team Green has also implemented something called “Battery Boost”, which should improve gaming performance when you’re not plugged into the wall. Basically, Nvidia is using an algorithm to detect what’s going on in the game you’re playing and adjusting performance accordingly. For example, it’ll lower GPU clocks when you’re in a dialogue scene, and push more performance when you actually need it.\nJust like its desktop counterpart, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 Mobile doesn’t have the strongest generational improvement over its predecessor. On average, I found that the RTX 5090 was about 8% faster than theRTX 4090. The performance gap was a bit better in workloads like 3DMark, but for the most part it doesn’t deliver much better gaming performance, at least before Frame Generation is brought into the equation.\nTo be clear, testing laptop graphics performance is a bit more complicated than testing a desktop graphics card, especially across generations. The Razer Blade 16 that Nvidia sent me for this architecture review is sporting an AMD Ryzen 9 AI HX 370, while the previous-gen Razer Blade 16 I used for testing the RTX 4090 has an Intel Core i9-13950HX – twoverydifferent processors. Plus, the chassis design has changed completely, and while we have a full review on the laptop coming later, the new design is much thinner and lighter, which calls into question thermal constraints.\nHowever, throughout my testing, I didn’t notice the RTX 5090 being thermal- or power-limited in any way, even if the RTX 4090 was able to stretch a little above the 160W power limit – though not by much. So, while my initial results point to the RTX 5090 being on average 8% faster than the RTX 4090, there is enough variability here to take the numbers with a bit of a grain of salt. We’ll have a clearer picture of what this GPU can do as more laptop designs head to market over the next year or so.\nIn 3DMark, the new RTX 5090 Mobile was 12% faster than the RTX 4090 in Speed Way, and 16% faster in Steel Nomad. These are both DirectX 12 tests, and indicate potential performance more than anything.\nWhen it comes to actual games, the performance differences are much less pronounced. For instance, inCall of Duty: Black Ops 6at 1600p, the RTX 5090 Mobile system got 107 fps, compared to 106 fps from the RTX 4090. That’s just a 1% improvement and totally within the margin of error.\nThings look a little better inCyberpunk 2077,where the RTX 5090 Mobile manages 67 fps to the 4090’s 62 fps, making for an 8% improvement. That’s decent, and it’s important to note that this is without Frame Generation, which will further increase the 5090’s lead in frame rate.\nI testedMetro Exodus: Enhanced Editionwith no upscaling, to give an idea of what to expect from pure ray tracing performance. In this game, the RTX 5090 gets 61 fps at 1600p with the Extreme Preset, compared to 56 fps from the RTX 4090, that’s a 9% improvement, lining up with the increase in CUDA cores almost exactly.\nRed Dead Redemption 2is a weird case, as it puts the RTX 5090behindthe RTX 4090 at 1600p with DLSS set to Balanced. The newer GPU gets 89 fps, compared to 93 from the RTX 4090, which is about a 4% drop. However, this is likely due to the CPU not being able to keep up.\nTotal War: Warhammer 3 is a good way to gauge pure rasterization performance, as it eschews any ray tracing or upscaling technologies. In this game, the RTX 5090 is about 6% faster than the 4090. Though this may be another case where the CPU is holding the 5090 back.\nIn Assassins Creed Mirage, the GeForce RTX 5090 is able to soar with 107 fps at 1600p with everything maxed and with DLSS set to Balanced. However, that’s only 4% faster than the RTX 4090 with the same settings.\nThen, in Black Myth: Wukong, a game that’s extremely GPU-heavy, the GeForce RTX 5090 gets 63 fps on average, which is only 5% faster than the 4090’s 60 fps average. This is one of the games that showed the strongest uplift for the RTX 5090 on desktop, so it's especially damning here.\nEven for creators, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 for laptops isn’t a huge improvement. In Blender, the RTX 5090 Mobile is only 9% faster than the RTX 4090 in the Monster benchmark. Blender performance usually gets better over time, but it’s something to keep in mind.\nThe main reason the desktop version of the RTX 5090 had a large lead over its predecessor was because it had a much higher power budget – 575W vs 450W. With the RTX 5090 and RTX 4090 having the same 160W power limit, we see similar results to other RTX 5000 graphics cards. Chips like the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5080 had very modest improvements over their predecessors, which also had similar power requirements. At least when it comes to traditional gaming performance, Blackwell seems to be an architecture that is extremely dependent on power, so it shouldn’t be surprising that laptop performance doesn’t scale as well as Nvidia’s desktop cards.\nThe biggest difference between the RTX 5090 and its predecessor is DLSS 4, and specifically multi-frame generation, or MFG. DLSS 4 does also include improvements that are available on previous-generation GPUs, like moving AI upscaling from a convolutional neural network (CNN) to a Transformer network. This greatly improves accuracy and image quality, whether you’re using the RTX 5090 or an older RTX graphics card.\nHowever, multi-frame generation really is the star of the show, particularly on the Razer Blade 16 with its 240Hz display.\nJust like the previous version of frame generation that debuted with DLSS 3, MFG uses the Tensor Cores to generate frames between natively rendered frames. It then uses the new AI Management Processor to pace out the frames to minimize latency and other weirdness. Frame pacing is a task that has traditionally been handled by the CPU, so the AMP is especially needed to cut down on system latency when the GPU is magically creating three frames in between each rendered one.\nFor a high refresh display, though, this is an awesome feature. It doesn’t improve latency or anything, but it does make the gameplaylooka lot smoother, which is really all you need in single-player games like Assassins Creed Shadows. Just don’t expect it to magically improve your response times if you enable it in an online shooter likeMarvel RivalsorFragpunk.\nNvidia claims that MFG can triple frame rates, but it’s important to keep in mind that there’s a catch: you need to already have a good frame rate to get a good experience from frame generation. I wouldn’t recommend any kind of frame generation unless you’re already getting 50-60 fps without it. Below that, you’re basically asking for weird artifacts to show up as the algorithm struggles to track objects between frames.\nIf you do already have a good frame rate though, MFG really does boost frame rates by a huge margin, even if it does come with a slight cost to latency. For instance, in Cyberpunk 2077 with the Ray Tracing Overdrive preset and with DLSS set to balanced with no frame generation, the Razer Blade 16 managed an average of 51 fps at 1600p. That came with latency around 47ms, which isn’tgreat, but still more than playable. When I turned frame generation to 2x, that frame rate jumps all the way up to 96 fps, with the latency going up to 53ms. That’s a huge improvement to framerate, and the latency cost really isn’tthat high. The latency cost is a bit greater with MFG, as turning it up to 4x increases average latency to 59ms – though the framerate jumps to 170 fps.\nIt’s a similar story inStar Wars Outlaws. At 1600p with DLSS set to balanced, the RTX 5090 Mobile gets around 61 fps on average, with an average latency around 36ms. With 2x frame generation the frame rate goes up to 115 fps, with latency also increasing to 45ms. The jump up to 4x frame generation only brings the latency up to 48ms, but bumps the frame rate up to 210 fps, which is getting extremely close to the laptop’s native refresh rate of 240 Hz.\nRealistically, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 is going to primarily be found in high-end gaming laptops with high resolution displays with high refresh rates. That’s exactly where multi frame generation shines, and it’s awesome to finally be able to take advantage of these super-fast laptop screens. Still, if you’re someone who is sensitive to latency or if you play competitive games, it might not be worth enabling.\nJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen. You can follow her@Jackiecobra\nIf you already have a decent gaming laptop, you really shouldn’t look at the RTX 5090 twice. It doesn’t deliver much of an improvement over its last-generation counterpart, which remains excellent. However, if you’ve been waiting to upgrade to a high-end gaming laptop for a while, features like multi-frame generation and battery boost will make premium laptops powered by Nvidia’s latest even better."

    "full_text": "Gaming fans are feeling the heat after Nintendo announced itsSwitch 2 U.S. pre-order date was delayedas a direct result of the newly announced tariffs posed by the Trump Administration.\n\nWednesday morning, Nintendo fully unveiled its hybrid console sequel alongside plans to open pre-orders come April 9 — news thatDonald Trump would soon implement sweeping tariffs across the globearrived just hours later. It was a moment of whiplash that the industry is still struggling to come to grips with, and now, two days later, the average gaming fan is already feeling the impact.\n“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,” Nintendo said in a statement shared with IGN. “Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”\nI really hate being right. I kept telling folks that things can literally change tomorrow. People kept yelling at me that the tariffs won't affect us...aight man 😒\n46% tariff on Vietnamese imports announced now.Nintendo Switch 2 are produced there…It’s so fucking over.pic.twitter.com/5N1iAMI2Jm\nthey’re gonna make it even more expensivepic.twitter.com/5Y8FL9FZF6\n“Wait a minute… are you sayingwehave to pay the tariffs??” oneReddit user commented. “Who could have possibly foreseen this?!”\nWhile pre-order timing for other territories, including the UK, remains unchanged, Nintendo didn’t mince words when it came to how tariffs will affect those in the United States. However, changes to a release schedule, even when it comes to something as simple as pre-order timing, signal that Nintendo has more on its mind than it has revealed thus far.\nThere were fears that Nintendo’s proposed $450 Switch 2 price and$80 gamesmight be too big of an ask pre-tariffs — amovement aiming to get Nintendo to lower its price plansalready began shortly after that initial reveal — but the struggle for affordable games is just getting started. While someanalysts had suggestedSwitch 2 prices were calculated with potential tariffs in mind, Nintendo’s announcement today suggests those numbers have room to increase.\nSo thenThose WERE the pre tariff pricesYeah the Switch and Mario Kart bout to be 650 after taxes\nAmericans checking the updated Switch 2 prices after complaining about the old oneshttps://t.co/fsC60LU5YEpic.twitter.com/t4RwqXia8J\nNintendo hasn’t announced when or if its Switch 2 prices will change, but there is plenty of reason to worry they will shift in a more expensive direction. What began as a wave of frustration aimed at the current Switch 2 price has now evolved into an ocean of people who, of course, are still angry, but now they are just hoping they’ll be able to afford the new console.\n“This unironically frustrates me so much,” anotherReddit user added. “The switch 2 was already going to be quite expensive (compared to the OG) but I was still okay with paying the extra money for it. The games were another blow. Was too expensive already but whatever. But this? Huge tariffsPlus Sales taxPlus tariffs on the games???\n“I don’t want to pay 130$ for a damn copy of a game or 600$ for the new Switch. I genuinely (think) this will impact the amount of people able to buy into all of this. I shouldn’t as an average person be priced out of this, yet I probably will be. Augh…”\nI feel bad for all my US followers. If you thought the Switch 2 price was expensive before. It looks like its going to get even worse due to new tariffs.\nWe'vespoken to other industry analystswho acknowledge that these unprecedented tariffs have gamers and game-makers walking into uncharted territory and that there's no telling what exactly will happen with the Switch 2. While some believe we could soon see a price increase, others aren't so sure, but all agree that the industry will no doubt feel the impact of the Trump Administration's wide-reaching tariff plans.\nThe Switch 2 is Nintendo’s latest groundbreaking console, but a suddenly increased price could be just the start of what’s to come. Wespoke with Entertainment Software Association (ESA) spokesperson Aubrey Quinn to learn more about how Trump’s unprecedented tariffs will impact video game fans moving forward. As many have already feared, the ESA says there’s no reason to believe the damage will stop at Nintendo.\nIt does not stop at Nintendo Switch 2 btw.-PC parts like CPU's and GPU's are gonna go up-Laptops going up-Anything Tech related is going up.Next PlayStation and Xbox gonna require a blood sacrifice.\nThe prices of your consoles, tech, and pretty much every daily necessity are about to go up.There's a good chance Nintendo is about to announce a price hike for the Switch 2.

    "title": "Call of Duty Console Players Unlikely to Be Cheating, They’re Just Killing You With an ‘Intel Advantage,’ Activision Says",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-28T17:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-console-players-unlikely-to-be-cheating-theyre-just-killing-you-with-an-intel-advantage-activision-says",
    "full_text": "Activision has detailed its ongoing anti-cheat work ahead of the launch of Season 3 inCall of Duty: Black Ops 6andWarzone, and confirmed something pretty much all Call of Duty players had assumed to be true.\n\nThe mega publisher has spent millions of dollars developing its anti-cheat technology as well as pursuing cheat makers in the courts, witha number of recent high-profile successes. Earlier in March,Phantom Overlay announced it was shutting down, with fans reacting in disbelief that such a prominent Call of Duty cheat provider would fall by the wayside. And just last week,IGN reported on four cheat providers that were shut downahead of next week’shotly anticipated return of Verdansk to Warzone.\nIn a newblog post, Activision said its plan has been “to go on the offensive and disrupt the cheating marketplace,” and as part of that it had shut down over 20 cheat makers and dozens of cheat resellers.\nTeam RICOCHET, the part of Activision dedicated to anti-cheat in Call of Duty, has issued over 228,000 bans since Black Ops 6 was released. Activision claimed it removed 23% of cheaters before they even played their first match.\n“These are strong wins for the game, but there’s always more we can do to get better in both speed and efficiency,” Activision said.\nSeason 3 brings with it new anti-cheat systems, although Activision said it didn’t want to give away details for “security reasons.”\n“Several of our current systems are getting big updates this season, too, including our aim bot detections and the Machine Learning system that analyzes game replays to identify suspicious gameplay for manual enforcement,” Activision continued.\nThe company then went on to address inaccurate in-game player reports in situations where the killing player might have had an intel advantage, such as when using Perks like Recon Scout or when having the advantage of a Spy Cam live ping.\n“Over 60% of received cheater reporting in Warzone have been against console players, for example,” Activision explained. “Console cheating is possible, but our data has consistently shown it represents an extremely low population of detected cheaters when compared to PC, which means that this large volume of cheater reports are inaccurate even if the KillCams may have made it seem like the player was cheating.”\nAs a result, Activision is updating the KillCam “to help demystify gunfights and increase the accuracy of player reports.”\n• List of attackers who dealt damage with their username, weapon, damage, and hits\n• Affected by Live Ping: If the enemy had you pinged via line-of-sight\n• Affected by UAV: If the enemy had you pinged on the minimap via UAV, UAV Tower, or Advanced UAV\n• Affected by Unsuppressed Weapon: When firing your weapon revealed your location on the minimap to nearby enemies\nDuring the upcoming Season, this widget will get more updates to callout even more gameplay elements like equipment, killstreaks, field upgrades, contracts, perks, and more to help players report with greater accuracy and confidence, Activision said.\nCrucially, Activision is also making changes to ranked play. In Season 3, a new system will reverse the impact a banned cheater had on the Ranked Play SR system:\n• When a Ranked Play cheater is banned, anyone they've recently defeated in Ranked Play will receive a SR Refund for those matches (to start, we will examine the last two weeks of matches but will continue to monitor if this timing needs to be adjusted)\n• Players who we detect playing with cheaters may have SR for those wins taken away\nThis process will be live for Black Ops 6 Ranked Play shortly after Season 03's launch and a similar system will arrive for Warzone when Ranked Play is live. Activision will also perform a leaderboard scrub before Season 02 ends to remove any account that earned SR illegitimately, such as from boosting.\nThe apparent prevalence of cheaters is considered by some to be ruining competitive multiplayer, and Activision had come under fire for failing to address the problem. Things got so bad that with the release of Season 2,Activision let console Ranked players disable crossplay with PC players.\nCheating is not unique to Call of Duty, of course, but it has become more problematic for Activision since it released free-to-download battle royale Warzone back in 2020. The hope among players is when Verdansk goes live in Warzone on April 3 alongside Season 3, cheating won't be quite as big a problem as it once was.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "full_text": "Atomfalllooks like a hit, with 1.5 million players reached and, ahem, 300,000 cups of tea drank.\n\nRebellion’s brand new IP set in the north of England is the company’s most successful launch in its 32-year history, it said. Rebellion is the developer behind the popular Sniper Elite series of games, as well as the spin-off Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army entries.\nHere's the official blurb:\n“We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall,” said Jason Kingsley CBE, CEO and co-founder of Rebellion.\n“To have surpassed the 1 million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off.\n“We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series.\n“We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game.”\nWhile Atomfall launched simultaneously across PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series X and S and Xbox One,it also released on Game Pass as a day-one title, which will have significantly boosted player numbers.\nRebellion did not say how many copies of the game were sold, however, preferring, like Assassin’s Creed Shadows maker Ubisoft, to go down the player number route. But it did provide some fun stats to back up it announcement.\nOver 316,000 Atomfall players, for example, have killed the scientist at the very beginning of the game. In total there have been over 3.7 million kills using the cricket bat, while over 4 million pasties and 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed.\nIGN'sAtomfall reviewreturned an 8/10.
