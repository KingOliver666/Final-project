"Nintendo Will Keep Making Amiibo for Nintendo Switch 2, Starting With Tears of the Kingdom, Street Fighters Figures",2025-04-02T16:06:17Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-will-keep-making-amiibo-for-nintendo-switch-2-starting-with-tears-of-the-kingdom-street-fighters-figures,"If you, like many of us, thought that Nintendo was finally winding down its ongoing production of tiny plastic figures with real yet negligible functionality in its video games with the release of its next console, think again. The Nintendo Switch 2 isn't just compatible with old amiibo, Nintendo seems to be committed to still making new ones. Today, it announced Tulin, Yunobo, Riju, Sidon, and Mineru's construct figurines from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Kimberley, Luke, and Jamie figures from Street Fighter 6.

The first four figurines launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, and have compatibility with Tears of the Kingdom, unlocking a fabric for Link's paraglider. They'll also provide weapons and materials in-game, just like the existing Tears of the Kingdom Link amiibo and the other past Zelda-series amiibo that are already compatible with the game.An additional amiibo for Mineru's construct will become available at a later date. It's likely that Mineru at least will have some sort of pairing with thenewly-announced Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonmentgame coming this winter, as the game takes place during the era when Mineru was building and using her construct, and we saw some of its gameplay in the trailer today.
We also learned that three Street Fighter 6 characters will get amiibo to go along with the release of Street Fighter 6 on Nintendo Switch 2. Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly will all get amiibo releases on June 5 as well, and a new run of amiibo cards will also launch themed around Street Fighter characters. We know that all of these will unlock ""exclusive in-game content"" such as device wallpapers, photo frames, and character customization capabilities.

It's undeniable that Nintendo had really tapered off its amiibo releases in recent years, so this news is a bit surprising. After an initial run of 18 back in 2014 when the figurines launched, it rapidly produced 71 different figures in 2015, and a steady cadence of 12 to 35 a year from 2016 until 2019. Amiibo releases slowed during the pandemic, and Nintendo began releasing fewer and fewer games with interesting amiibo support features. In 2024, only 7 new amiibo were released, and only two amiibo-compatible games: The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and Monster Hunter Stories. Given the slowdown, it's a bit surprising to see Nintendo recommit, but as long as collectors are still happy, right?

"Nintendo Switch 2 Preorders Get Some Nintendo Store Restrictions, Presumably to Thwart Scalpers",2025-04-02T16:04:28Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-get-some-nintendo-store-restrictions-presumably-to-thwart-scalpers,"The Nintendo Switch 2 arrives on June 5, 2025, and it will likely be a hot commodity when it launches. Over on the official Nintendo store, the company is implementing some pre-order measures to ensure bona fide Switch players are getting their pre-orders.

On theMy Nintendo Store, those with a Nintendo Account can register their interest in pre-ordering a Nintendo Switch 2 system and ""select accessories"" from the Nintendo Store. Those who express interest will then get an invitation email once their turn in line comes up, valid for 72 hours. The catch? You'll need to have put in some time on your old Switch, and been a Switch Online member.
""Invitation emails will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis to registrants who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025,"" according to the fine print on the site.
Nintendo also notes that invitations are ""non-transferable"" and will be sent to email addresses associated with the Nintendo Account that registers interest. For the system and each accessory, there will also be a one-per-account limit during the invitation period. Currently on the site, you can express interest in either a base Nintendo Switch 2 system, or the one bundled with Mario Kart World.
Orders will be shipped after purchase, and the approximate shipping date will be provided when ordering. Nintendo also specifies: ""Please note that release-day delivery is not guaranteed due to processing and shipment times.""
While not said outright by Nintendo, all of these measures seem dedicated towards ensuring that someone buying a Switch 2 through this process is someone who wants to purchase and play a Switch 2 for themselves, rather than flip it online.
Scalping has been a frequent problem for new releases of sought-after products. Notably, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S sawscalpers pursuing the new hardware, and the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game hasbeen dealing with ongoing scalping and shortages.
Valve found some success in its queue system for the Steam Deck, utilizing a method that tied Steam accounts to purchases alongside checks for whether an account was made before, or after, a certain window.It worked, and it's not surprising now to see Nintendo taking similar measures with the My Nintendo Store process.
Of course, there will be other ways to pick up a Switch 2. But hopefully options like this can help some long-time Switch 1 owners avoid the potential chaos of locking down a launch day Switch 2 pre-order.

Palworld Communications Director Says Nintendo Switch 2 Version '100% Worth Considering' if the Console Is 'Beefy Enough',2025-03-24T11:15:56Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough,"When Pocketpair's monster capturing survival adventurePalworldlaunched, many people compared it to Pokemon, specificallycalling it  ""Pokemon with guns."" It's not Pocketpair's favorite comparison, according to communications director John 'Bucky' Buckley, but the thought of collecting a following of adorable monsters has nonetheless prompted a number of people to ask if Palworld would ever make it to Pokemon's platform of choice, the Nintendo Switch.

Unfortunately, according to Buckley, that's not in the cards, largely due to technical reasons. ""If we could make the game work on the Switch, we would, but Palworld is a beefy game.""
I spoke to Buckley at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco last week following his talk, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During our chat, I also asked Buckley about the possibility of a Nintendo Switch 2 release. He said that Pocketpair is interested, but hasn't gotten a chance to see if a port is even possible yet.
""We haven't seen those specs yet,"" he said. ""Like everyone else, we're waiting. I'm walking around GDC hoping someone will tell me them, but everyone I've spoken to says they haven't even seen them.
""If it's beefy enough, it's 100% worth considering. We did a lot of optimization for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with. Still work to do, but we're really happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible.""
Pocketpairremains entangled in a lawsuit from Nintendo over alleged patent infringement against Pokemon's ball-throwing mechanics, leading some to speculate that to be the actual reason Palworld hadn't made it to Switch.
But the lawsuit isn't really what's stopping the studio from releasing games on Nintendo's platforms,as we saw back in January. Buckleyaddressed the lawsuit very briefly in his GDC talk, saying that it caught the team by surprise, and that the team had done numerous legal checks in the lead-up to release in order to prevent that exact thing. ""Pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge fan [of Pokemon],"" Buckley said in the talk, ""so it was a very depressing day, everyone heads down and walking in the rain.""
The question is, would Nintendo allow a game it's taken such issue with on its next-gen console?
We'll be posting our full interview with Buckley at GDC later this week, so keep checking back for more about Palworld. In the meantime, it's a great time to revisit Palworld if you've stepped away, asthe game just got cross-platformplay in a new update last week.

Bloodborne Fans React to Nintendo Switch 2 Exclusive The Duskbloods,2025-04-02T15:41:19Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-fans-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods,"The most surprising reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct might have been a third-party game. Announced near the end of the showcase, FromSoftware is developing a brand-new game calledThe Duskbloods, which has some striking similarities to the beloved PlayStation 4-exclusive Bloodborne.

The Duskbloods is a new game, to be clear, set to arrive sometime in 2026 worldwide, and exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2. Playing as the ""Bloodsworn,"" a group that has gone beyond humanity thanks to special blood, players will enter a violent melee to become the ""First Blood.""
Confirmed in a press release from FromSoftware, The Duskbloods is a PvPvE title with ""online multiplayer at its core,"" with up to eight players battling for the win among themselves. So while all the blood, guns, and machinery brings to mind Bloodborne, it may also have quite a bit in common with the upcomingElden Ring Nightreign, though with some PvP rather than solely co-op PvE.
We didn't get much more than that, besides cryptic teases and some looks at some horrifying beasts and bosses. Still, Bloodborne fans are having a wide variety of reactions to this.
""BLOOD! EVERY FIVE SECONDS THEY TALKED ABOUT BLOOD!"" saidone commenter in the r/Bloodborne post about The Duskbloods on Reddit. Another said: ""That game is 100% Bloodborne 2. I assume the name change is either because it's in a different setting, or because of Sony exclusivity.""
Though The Duskbloods is still different, it's easy to see the connections that would have fans feeling like it's a spiritual sucessor to Bloodborne. And while the Souls games and Elden Ring have gone onto other systems ‚Äî Elden Ring even got aTarnished Edition locked in for the Switch 2‚Äî Bloodborne has remained a PlayStation 4 exclusive since release, not even making it over to PC. A port, sequel, or really anything has been something fans have wanted for years.
""Nintendo really got tired of waiting for Bloodborne 2 and just decided to fund it themselves,"" anothercommenter said. Another reply points out that, much like Bloodborne, The Duskbloods is currently a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. ""Bloodborne was always an exclusive, this is on brand,"" areplier added.
The announcement definitely kick-started the Bloodborne faithful, though reality has been setting in with confirmation that this sounds like a battle royale-style game, rather than a single-player RPG you'd normally expect from FromSoftware.
Some commenters startedexpressing dulled excitementover the revelation that The Duskbloods is a PvPvE experience. Threads have sprung up of fans finding this out, only to then express that between a multiplayer focus and Switch 2 exclusivity, they might not be so eager to jump on for The Duskbloods.
We're due to learn more about The Duskbloods soon, as Nintendo will post an interview with director Hidetaka Miyazaki on its website on April 4. Presumably this will shed some light on how exactly The Duskbloods will work, what its PvPvE will look like, and whether this can truly be enough to sate the Bloodborne fans who've been holding out hope for so long.
For all the other news announced during today's stream, be sure tocheck out our recap of everything announced at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.

Every Kirby Game on the Nintendo Switch in 2025,2025-04-03T00:14:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/all-kirby-games-on-nintendo-switch-in-order,"Kirby has been a steadfast Nintendo mascot for 33 years, ever since the character debuted in 1992‚Äôs Kirby‚Äôs Dream Land for Game Boy. In addition to being a Smash Bros. staple, Kirby and his ever-evolving powers of inhalation have starred in over two dozen games, culminating in the series‚Äô best-selling game to date, Kirby and the Forgotten Land.

As we near the end of Nintendo‚Äôs current console generation, we‚Äôve compiled a list of every Kirby game on the Switch as well asnew Kirby gamescoming to the Switch 2.
Six Kirby games have been released on Nintendo Switch, while 11 more retro Kirby games are playable withNintendo Switch Online. The franchise debuted on Switch in 2018 with Kirby Star Allies; its latest release, Kirby‚Äôs Return to Dream Land Deluxe, arrived in 2023. A new Kirby game,Kirby Air Riders, will be releasing for theNintendo Switch 2in 2025.
Kirby‚Äôs Switch debut came in 2018 withKirby Star Allies. The action-platformer is played with a party of four (multiplayer or local AI) and sees Kirby combine abilities with allies to solve puzzles and enhance combat.
Series developer HAL Laboratories and Nintendo brought the pink puff back the following year for the free-to-playSuper Kirby Clash. Like Star Allies, Clash is played with a team of four that can be controlled by other human players or AI. Unlike Star Allies, this is not a platformer but rather a standalone boss rush mode; it features a hub world for changing equipment and selecting quests, though the heart of the game is the series of boss fights that serve as those quests.
A sequel to the 3DS game Kirby Fighters Deluxe (an expanded version of the subgame Kirby Fighters found in Kirby: Triple Deluxe),Kirby Fighters 2is exactly what it sounds like: a fighting game starring Kirby. It supports up to four players and features Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede, Bandana Waddle Dee, Gooey, and Magolor as playable characters.
The series‚Äô standout game on Switch,Kirby and the Forgotten Landis a post-apocalyptic adventure in which Kirby gets sucked into a wormhole that appears above Dream Land. The Forgotten Land is the series‚Äô first fully 3D platformer, complete with puzzles and Kirby‚Äôs signature ability-based combat. It‚Äôs the series‚Äô best-selling game to date, selling more than 7.5 million copies by the end of March 2024. There's even a Switch 2 version of this game currentlylisted to be available for preorder.
Kirby‚Äôs Dream Buffetis a dessert-themed multiplayer game released in 2022. It features three four-player game modes: race, minigame, and battle royale. The modes can be played separately or together as part of Dream Buffet‚Äôs Gourmet Grand Prix.
The series‚Äô latest game,Kirby‚Äôs Return to Dream Land Deluxeis a remake of the 2011 Wii game Kirby‚Äôs Return to Dream Land. The action-platformer came to Switch with improved visuals, a new easy mode (Helper Magolor), three new abilities (Sand, Mecha, and Festival), and an all-new two-hour adventure called Magolor Epilogue: The Interdimensional Traveler.
Return to Dream Land Deluxe supports local co-op for up to four players, with each player taking control of either Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede, or Bandana Waddle Dee.
There are 11 Kirby games available with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Those with a regular subscription can play nine Kirby games from NES, SNES, and Game Boy, while those with the more expensive Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription get access to two additional games: Kirby & The Amazing Mirror (GBA) and Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards (N64).
Here‚Äôs the list of Kirby games playable with Nintendo Switch Online, ordered by initial release date:
Anew GameCube librarywill also be available in the NSO + Expansion Pack membership on Switch 2, which may include Kirby Air Ride.

The era of Kirby on Switch may be coming to a close, but the character's journey on the Switch 2 has just begun.Kirby Air Riderswas officially announced during theApril 2025 Nintendo Directas a follow-up to the 2003Kirby Air Ride racing gameon GameCube. Masahiro Sakurai, creator of both the Kirby series and Super Smash Bros., returns as director of the new game.
Kirby and the Forgotten Land is also on the list of games that will be gettingSwitch 2 upgrades. The upgrade will take advantage of the Switch 2'simproved specsand includes a new story expansion. Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World will be released on August 28 with a discounted upgrade option for those who owned the original game on Switch.

"Xenoblade Chronicles X Appears to Have a 'Hidden' 60 FPS Mode, Sparking Nintendo Switch 2 Speculation",2025-03-20T16:40:58Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-x-appears-to-have-a-hidden-60-fps-mode-sparking-nintendo-switch-2-speculation,"Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Editionis out today for Nintendo Switch consoles, and some players are already digging into the data to learn more about it. One discovery seems to reveal a ""hidden"" mode enabling 60 frames per second, which is certainly cause for curiosity and speculation about what it could mean for the Switch 2.

Over onX/Twitter(viaWccftech), modder MasaGratoR dug into the executable of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition and found what they called a ""hidden 60 FPS mode."" The modder said it seems to be implemented ""only partially,"" since enabling it causes ""weird issues.""
About Xenoblade Chronicles X:- Dynamic resolution ranges: 504p-720p handheld, 760p-1080p docked- Game's executable has hidden 60 FPS mode. It seems to be implemented only partially since enabling it causes weird issues. As a proof screen from function that sets UI speed, 1.0.1pic.twitter.com/Ag09YVQ7g1
While it's not implemented in the game proper, the existence of this setting does spark some interesting questions. If it's not available, why is it in there? While some stray leftover code could be one answer, some speculation about what this could mean for the Switch 2 and existing Switch games is also easy to understand.
Nintendo has confirmed that theSwitch 2 will bemostlybackward compatible. The official reveal of its next console said that the console will play Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games, as well as Nintendo Switch games, with an asterisk that certain Nintendo Switch games ""may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.""
It's hard to imagine Xenoblade Chronicles X would be one of those asterisked games, but there is a question over whether existing Switch games would get enhanced on the next-gen console. There's no proof of that yet, just speculation over the usual trends of backward compatibility. It certainly makes the Switch 2 all the more interesting for existing Switch owners, though.
We'll hopefully learn more in just a few weeks, whenNintendo airs its Switch 2 Direct on April 2, 2025. There, we'll learn more about the upcoming console and Nintendo's plans for it.

Our Big Nintendo Switch 2 Interview with Nintendo of America's Bill Trinen,2025-04-07T13:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen,"Editor‚Äôs note: This interview was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior toNintendo‚Äôs announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States due to the potential impact of tariffs. Parts of this interview were edited for clarity.

Nintendo has finally pulled back the curtain onNintendo Switch 2, revealing the company's vision for its next-generation console and its games. Butovershadowing dicussion around what the Switch 2 is capable of, the new gameplay mechanics inMario Kart World, and OG Switch games that will find a new lease of life on Switch 2, isa backlash to Nintendo's pricing strategy.
We sat down with Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience Bill Trinen to talk about the big first-party reveals like Mario Kart World andDonkey Kong Bananza, the strategy behindpricing Switch 2 at $450andMario Kart at $80, the decision to releaseNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour as a paid digital productrather than a pack-in game, his excitement forMetroid Prime 4: Beyond's mouse controlsandMasahiro Sakurai's return to the Kirby franchise, and more. Plus, does Bill know what Switch 2 cartridges taste like? Read our full interview below to find out.
IGN:Congrats on finally unveiling Nintendo Switch 2. How does it feel to finally have it out there?
Bill Trinen:Well, it's just exciting to be able to get all the details out there. For us, the most important thing is that we really want people to recognize and understand that Nintendo Switch 2 is the true successor to Nintendo Switch, takes what you love about Nintendo Switch, and then builds on it with a whole lot of new features and new capabilities and new games that take advantage of those. And really takes what has evolved gaming with Nintendo into something that's a lot more social through things likeGameChat, which takes what was the anytime, anywhere play of Nintendo Switch and makes it more all together, anytime, anywhere.
IGN:So you just mentioned GameChat, that was a huge part of your presentation yesterday. Why was now the time to finally introduce Nintendo voice chat, which is something that people have wanted on your consoles for a really long time?
Trinen:Well, I would say we've always looked at it from the perspective of, 'what is Nintendo's real strength and what are Nintendo's real values?' And for us, the most important thing is putting smiles on people's faces and doing it in a way that people can see and experience the smiles that they have with the people that are most important to them.
And certainly there have been other game systems with chat and things like that up until now, but what we wanted to do was to take something that could finally replicate that same room, couch multiplayer, couch co-op experience and joy, and bring that into an online space. And so for us, GameChat is why it's so important is the combination of being able to see their faces, being able to see what they're doing from a gameplay perspective and being able to feel like you've finally got a virtual space where you can have those same experiences that you might have in your living room. So that's why with the power of, I would say Switch 2, being able to finally execute that has been a big focus for us.
IGN:Cool. And we always knew if you did voice chat, it would be in the most Nintendo way, and just with the camera and the mic on the unit in the dock and you say, 'oh, don't worry the background noise won't get in.' It was a cool presentation.
Trinen:Good. And that's the nice thing is with the built-in microphone, it's like, yeah, you can just voice chat if you want and you can do that portably as well.
IGN:Well, let's talk about Donkey Kong Bananza. I love the title by the way, it's perfect. Although last night when I was scrambling to typemy preview, it autocorrected to 'Bonanza' every time, and I was like, 'I‚Äôve got to add this to my dictionary.' But I love the name and it's so exciting to see DK back in the spotlight after so long. And I noticed so many things just getting my hands on the controller for the first time. So when you guys got this game in at Nintendo of America, what stuck out to you the most? What was your favorite part about working on it from a localization perspective or anything else?
Trinen:Well, so I'll start with a really terrible joke, which is I like to call this the most groundbreaking game in video game history.
IGN:[Laughs] I used that in my preview today. I said, 'you have to break all the ground you can because you might make a groundbreaking discovery.'
Trinen:[Laughs] That's right. So for us, the number one thing that I think is probably just the most satisfying about this game is just DK the character. He's back, he's back in a big way. And DK is a character within the pantheon of Nintendo characters who has always been a bit on the more powerful side, wild at times, silly.
And all of that has just been thoroughly baked into this game. And as the character DK, you're able to use the power of his punches and you might attack an enemy in the environment, and that enemy goes flying and hits a wall and the wall crumbles and you see something there, and that then entices you to go in and start digging through the terrain to see what else you can find back there. And it just creates this incredibly rewarding cycle of destruction and discovery that is woven all throughout the game.
IGN:The discovery via destruction was a really cool cornerstone of this game from my time with it. I thought that was just really great. And the second that I started playing it, I just felt the DNA ofSuper Mario Odysseyand Mr. [Yoshiaki] Koizumi's team all over this in so many ways. Are they the ones that are working on this?
Trinen:It's a very good question. You'll have to stay tuned. We always like to start by showcasing the game and getting people focused on the gameplay, but we'll have some information to share about the developer in due time.
IGN:Okay. Can you tell me, is this internally developed? Because there hasn't been an internal Donkey Kong game since I believe Jungle Beat was the last one?
Trinen:Jungle Beat was the last one.
IGN:You had the NST (Nintendo Software Technology) do the Mario vs. Donkey Kongs, but...
Trinen:NST has done the Mario vs. Donkey Kong games, but this is going to be a fun one.
IGN:So nothing more on that?
Trinen:Nothing more on that yet.
IGN:Okay. I had to try. Let's talk about Mario Kart World, because there's so much great stuff in there, but I thinkthe cow is what's stealing everybody's heart. Did you expect that reaction? There's Akira memes about the cow, it's hilarious out there. Did you know the cow was going to be a big star?
Trinen:I would say perhaps not as big as the cow has become. Internally, certainly the very first moment that we saw the cow, everybody wanted to play as Cow.
IGN:When we were playing Knockout Tour yesterday, there were just like seven cows on the track.
Trinen:Well, that's the other thing that I just love about Mario Kart World is with the interconnected world of tracks, as I'm driving, you'll start something like Knockout Tour and you'll be driving across the continent. And what used to be the Mario Kart model was there's discrete tracks and you race on a discrete track and then you choose a different track and you race on a different discrete track.
And now what I find is I'm driving through, I'm starting in a new track and driving across the terrain and, 'Oh, I just happened to pass through Moo Moo Meadows and now I'm onto the next thing.' And it's just like for somebody that's grown up playing Mario Kart for so many years, just to be able to have that experience and piece it all together mentally into this big massive continent of racing has been a whole lot of fun for me.
IGN:It feels like a theme park of Mario Kart history, and I'm driving yesterday and going through all the different segments and then all of a sudden, 'Oh, I'm in the geyser tunnel from Dino Dino Jungle from Double Dash.' But I'm wondering, so right now it seems like the races, you start at one track and end up at another, and then the final lap is one loop around that final circuit you end up at. Not in the Knockout Tour, that's different, but is there a time trial or versus race mode that‚Äôs a way to just do three laps at this track? Or are you always driving interconnected between them when you're racing?
Trinen:You will have abilities to drive three laps on certain tracks. Obviously we've got a Nintendo Direct dedicated to Mario Kart World coming. I think you'll see a lot more on the game there, and I think a lot more that will hopefully surprise you and make you really feel like, 'Wow, there's a lot to this game.'
IGN:That will be really good to see. Because right now it looks great, it plays great, but I think the talk of the town is the price tag. This is an $80 game from Nintendo in the United States and $50 if you buy the Nintendo Switch 2 bundle. But I saw somewhere on your website that that bundle is only available for a limited time while supplies last. Can you just talk about the strategy behind pricing Mario Kart World this way?
Trinen:Well, I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value? Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, but I did read your article this morning and I think you had mentioned that you didn‚Äôt find a lot to discover when roaming around. So I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out about that.
But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.
IGN:Okay. And to just stay on pricing for a little bit here.I'm looking at the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of games and some games are $70, some are $80. That's what it's looking like right now. And some are cheaper than that too. I don't think we know the U.S. price for the Welcome Tour yet, but I think we saw the Japanese price is around $10.
Trinen:Yeah, the U.S. price is $9.99 for the Welcome Tour.
IGN:$9.99. Okay, digital only.
Trinen:Yes.
IGN:I'm just wondering about the strategy behind pricing these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions at the combination of the Switch 1 retail price, usually $59.99, and then whatever that upgrade path is, like $10 for Breath of the Wild, making that a $70 game, or Tears of the Kingdom is an $80 game because it's $70 plus the $10 upgrade path. Can you just walk me through the strategy behind not offering any sort of discount for newcomers on Switch 2 and saying, 'Tears of the Kingdom is $80 now just like Mario Kart is?'
Trinen:Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?' What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you're looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that's the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game.
For somebody who has bought Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the Zelda upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership. So there's no additional charge for those. But I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that.
IGN:Okay, thanks. And then the pricing for the console itself, too. A lot of people are talking about it ‚Äî $450 in the United States, and we know there are definitely global economic factors at play. Can you share anything behind the strategy for pricing of the console? Was this something that was up to the wire where you didn't know what it was going to cost until recently? Can you share any insight?
Trinen:Can't really share insight into any of that. Obviously the cost of everything goes up over time, and I personally would love if the cost of things didn't go up over time. But I think any time you're building a new system that's got new features and new tech, there's costs associated with that. So again, we look at what is the experience on Nintendo Switch? What's the experience on Nintendo Switch 2? What are the new features that it offers? And certainly there's the cost of goods and things that factor into that, but we try to find the right appropriate price for a product based on that.
IGN:Last question on price, I promise. I played Welcome Tour on the show floor and I walked away and thought, 'this is a perfect pack-in game.' It shows what the console is, it shows HDR, it shows these new technologies Nintendo is embracing ‚Äî in some cases for the first time ‚Äî and I feel like it's a great showcase for the console. Was there ever any talk of making this a pack-in game, and why did you make the decision to price it as a separate digital product?
Trinen:It's an interesting product. We're actually getting ready today, we're going to be doing someNintendo Treehouse Live segmentsand covering a lot of games in detail. That's one of them. And I think people will be able to see through Treehouse Live probably a little bit more maybe than you were able to see on the show floor. It's a pretty robust piece of software. There's a lot of great detail in there.
For some people, I think there are people who are particularly interested in the tech and the specs of the system and things like that, for them I think it's going to be a great product. It's really for people that want more information about the system rather than necessarily a quick intro to everything it does. And for that reason and just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, 'Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you're getting out of the product.'
IGN:Okay. I want to talk about some of the features of the Joy-Con 2 now because I was really impressed with the mouse functionality. I thought that it worked really, really well in something like Metroid Prime 4. I can see that being the preferred way for a lot of people to play that game. So what are your expectations for mouse controls? Are you hoping that third-party developers make great use of them? Do you think it can bring new types of games? Just talk to me about your feelings about the mouse.
Trinen:Well, personally, I'm really excited about the mouse control. I don't know what your experience with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was, the way that to me is probably my favorite way to play is I like to play split Joy-Con. I just like the freedom of having my hands not locked onto a controller like that. So I often like to play split Joy-Con and having the freedom to just seamlessly drop the mouse down for combat and then pick it back up for split Joy-Con, to me is something, number one, you can't do with any other console, you can't do on PC.
And it makes for a really great experience for the Prime series, particularly because the Prime series is the creator of the first-person adventure genre. And so in a series where you're doing a lot of exploration that's got some combat mixed in with it, that freedom feels right. Because for me, I feel like if I'm doing a lot of exploration, I want to be split Joy-Con. That flexibility to me is amazing.
I think the other thing that probably I'm hoping people are catching onto is that, yes, the Joy-Con 2 introduced mouse control, but they introduce mouse control in conjunction with the other technology within the Joy-Con. So whereas with a PC mouse, you're moving up and down and side to side and whatnot, with the Joy-Con, you've got the added ability to apply things like the angle that you're twisting the Joy-Con at, and having that also impact the play control with the mouse.
Or you've got two Joy-Con that have mouse control each, and that means two things. It means either you can have immediate two-player mouse control gameplay right out of the box with the Nintendo Switch 2, or it means, as we see withDrag x Drive, that you can do things with dual Joy-Con control, which hasn't been done before. And so my hope is really threefold. One, is that our own development teams continue to experiment with what they can do with the mouse to create creative new ways to use it.
I hope that we start to see third-parties that are then looking at opportunities with things like dual mouse control or combination of mouse plus motion control to evolve their gameplay. But I also do hope that when you look at PC developers, for example, if they want to bring a PC-based game to console, they have to spend a lot of time revamping the control scheme and adapting it to button controls. And so having the freedom of mouse control with the Joy-Con hopefully makes PC developers a lot more eager to want to bring their games to Nintendo Switch 2.
IGN:Well, my social team really wants to know. We don't have Switch 2 cartridges here. Do they taste like Switch 1 cartridges?
Trinen:[Laughs] I don't know yet.
IGN:You haven't done a taste test?
Trinen:I have not done a taste test. I keep hoping for pistachio flavor, but that's not happening.
IGN:[Laughs] I don't think that would turn away the kids. Okay, cool. Well, my last question here is that Kirby Air Riders was a huge surprise at the Nintendo Direct yesterday. And to see that is this secret project thatMr. [Masahiro] Sakurai teased earlier this year after wrapping up his YouTube series. Cool to see him come back to work with you guys again. Can you share any details further than that teaser we got in the Direct?
Trinen:Well, I believe Mr. Sakurai has said that there will not be any additional information on the game for quite a while. The team's working very hard on it. But for me, this was probably one of the most exciting announcements for a couple of reasons.
One, I'm always excited to see what Sakurai-san is working on. Two, he created the Kirby character and the Kirby franchise. And so it's great to see him come back to lead and direct a Kirby game again for the first time in a couple of decades. But I think more importantly, I've always felt that Kirby Air Ride on GameCube was a game that was ahead of its time and maybe not fully understood at the time that it came out.
And so I'm just really excited because there's a core group of people that played that game on GameCube that love it to death. And number one, I'm just happy because for them, this is such a big announcement and it's so good to see their excitement. But at the same time, I think that with where we are in the game industry today, I think we've got a real opportunity to introduce a much bigger audience to Kirby Air Riders. And I think people will finally really begin to appreciate just what I think is the genius of Masahiro Sakurai and what he created with that game.
IGN:Well, I'm in that core group. It's like one of my big childhood games. I love Kirby Air Ride, City Trial Free Roam. That's all I was doing, so I'm very excited. But thanks so much, Bill. We're super excited for June 5 and everything else that's coming on the way.
Trinen:Great. Thank you.

Nintendo Switch 2 Developers Discuss The Console's Tech and Iwata's Lasting Legacy on its Development,2025-04-07T13:28:14Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-developers-discuss-the-consoles-tech-and-iwatas-lasting-legacy-on-its-development,"Editor‚Äôs note: This interview was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior toNintendo‚Äôs announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States due to the potential impact of tariffs. Parts of this interview were edited for clarity.

After getting hands-on with Nintendo Switch 2 at last week‚Äôs reveal in New York, IGN spoke with the hardware leads spearheading the development of Nintendo‚Äôs newest console. Kouchi Kawamoto and Takuhiro Dohta from Nintendo‚Äôs Entertainment Planning and Development Department, along with Tetusya Sasaki from Nintendo‚Äôs Technology Development Division, talked to IGN‚Äôs Brian Altano about the technology behind Switch 2, the classic Nintendo handhelds that have inspired them and the impact former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata‚Äôs legacy had on the development of the console.
IGN:Can you talk about the SOC system on a chip the Nintendo Switch 2 was running? Is it Nvidia Tegra? If not, can you reveal which graphics architecture it's based on?
Nintendo:I think you'll find a lot of the details in NVIDIA's information that they've shared.
IGN:One of the notes in the direct suggested to hit 4K in dock mode, upscaling may be required. What kind of upscaling is this system using? Is it using AI upscaling?
Nintendo:I think probably the main kind of easiest upscaling to use is the DLSS that Nvidia provides. So from that standpoint, I guess you could say this AI.
Nintendo:That said, we're planning on providing other options of upscaling through software and so ranging from something that uses AI to something that's not. I think you'll see that as time passes. And lastly, I'll add that even though there is upscaling, there's also the option to not upscale and just output natively. So that's also an option that developers can use.
IGN:What about ray tracing? Is that something that your team experimented with?
Nintendo:Just like DLSS, that's when we're kind of making the graphics of a game. We consider ray tracing as just another tool to do that ‚Äì it's not that we're going to try to use ray tracing on everything, but really trying to figure out what types of graphics, what types of screens, what types of situations are best suited for ray tracing, and then trying to apply that. That's the approach we took when we did all of our researching and experimenting.
IGN:We saw that the switch two supports third party cameras. What about third-party mice?
Nintendo:You're talking about USB mice, things like that?
IGN:Yeah, not the animal!
Nintendo:[Laughs] It really depends on the game software with the structure. So if that software supports third-party USB mice, yes.
IGN:I have a six-year-old daughter. She took my Switch and I don't get to play it anymore. She also has dropped it a lot and it's okay. What have you done with Switch 2 to make sure that it can survive a kid dropping it on the floor or dropping it down the stairs?
Nintendo: Nintendo has made very sturdy devices through the ages and I believe that this time around as well, we've made something that will be sturdy.
Nintendo:Yeah, you can drop it a little bit. I don‚Äôt recommend it though!
IGN:I also have a Steam Deck and I like it, but the fan gets very loud when I'm playing high end games. It's almost distracting. What did Nintendo do to make sure that that was taken into account when designing the hardware for Switch 2?
Nintendo:When a fan is loud it really does affect one's gameplay, so that is definitely something we had in the back of our mind during the development of the Nintendo Switch 2. The system is made to adapt depending on the processing capability so I'm kind of curious to hear from the others here what their experience has been like.
Nintendo:When I was playing it it's not like, ‚ÄúWow, there's a fan in there‚Äù. It hasn‚Äôt really gotten to the point where, even through development of the hardware, it has bothered me in any way.
Nintendo:The hardware team put quite a lot of effort into making sure the airflow was smooth. So a lot is coming in but there's a lot coming out, and as such the fan noise isn't too significant.
IGN:Nintendo invented the directional pad and it's been important for video games for my entire life. What did your team do to ensure that the Dpad on the Switch 2 was great for fighting games, puzzle games, platformers, all that fun stuff?
Nintendo:You may think that every time you see the directional pad that it's just the same button being reused, but the truth is we do make small adjustments and add small changes every time. I have people ‚Äì our development and game development teams ‚Äì try them out when we make a new one.
Nintendo:This is a more detailed point but for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller directional buttons, we made it so that it's even more difficult to have mistaken input. Of course, it doesn't completely eliminate that possibility but it should reduce it.
IGN:I'm a big fan of Nintendo handheld systems and always have been since the original Game Boy. What are each of your personal favorite classic Nintendo handhelds?
Nintendo:I have fond memories for each of the systems that have come out but for me personally, I think the original Game Boy really has a special place in my heart. Part of the reason for that is that since then there's obviously new systems that came out, like the Game Boy Advance for example. But I just distinctly remember my mother with the original Game Boy playing Tetris, and that‚Äôs just burned into my memory.
IGN:Some of you worked with the legendary Satoru Iwata. Is there any specific part of his legacy that inspired the Nintendo Switch 2 design?
Nintendo:There are various aspects but what comes to mind first is the magnet connector. We originally didn't adopt it for the Nintendo Switch because it wasn't as secure as we would've liked. However, we put a lot of effort into this aspect and that has come to fruition.
Nintendo:It was Mr. Iwata's concerns about the magnets that meant it didn't come to fruition [for the original Switch]. So being able to actually address all of the issues and create something that probably would've met his standards is moving and meaningful.
IGN:I love it. I think I took the JoyCon on and off 20 times yesterday!
Nintendo:I actually have a question for you. You saw the footage of the JoyCon 2 snapping on and off. Was the impression you got from that footage different from actually snapping it on and off?
IGN:Yes. I thought it was going to be like a refrigerator magnet and it was going to be wobbly loose and instead it just goes ‚Äòsnap‚Äô and clicks in. And I was like, ‚ÄúOh, that feels really nice.‚Äù
Nintendo:I'm very relieved to hear that!
IGN:Yeah, they told me I had to stop doing it!
Brian Altano has been playing Mario Kart for 30+ years, and it's crazy that 10 of those years were spent with Mario Kart 8. We haven't seen Battle Mode for Mario Kart World yet, but he's still holding out hope that Block Fort can come back. Bring back Block Fort!"
"Nintendo's Switch 2 Treehouse Livestream Is Just a Flood of Angry Comments Shouting ""DROP the PRICE""",2025-04-03T14:41:47Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendos-switch-2-treehouse-livestream-is-just-a-flood-of-angry-comments-shouting-drop-the-price,"Nintendo‚Äôs first post-Switch 2 Nintendo Direct Treehouse livestream is being flooded with angry comments from users calling on the company to ""DROP THE PRICE.""

A cursory glance at the YouTube chat for the stream shows a flood of complaints about the pricing of Nintendo‚Äôs move to the next-generation, which includes the $449.99 Switch 2 and, perhaps most controversially,the jump to $79.99 for Mario Kart World.
Whilethe Nintendo Switch 2 system itself will retail for $449.99, a bundle is also available with Mario Kart Worldincluded for $499.99, saving $30 on the price of the game.
But Mario Kart World isn‚Äôt the only Nintendo Switch 2 game to cost $79.99.Some Nintendo Switch 2 Edition titles, such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, also cost $79.99.
Nintendo has even come under firefor charging for the Switch 2 tutorial video game experience, Welcome Tour, which fans have said should be a free pack-in.Astro's Playroom, for example, comes pre-installed on every PlayStation 5 console, serving additionally as a free tech demo for the DualSense controller.

The shock at Nintendo‚Äôs pricing is now spilling over into the Treehouse livestream, although the presenters have so far, perhaps understandably, ignored the chat. It seems likely that Nintendo will face this sort of thing from the video game community from now on, piling the pressure on the company to address the complaints.

Did Nintendo Just Accidentally Reveal An Unannounced Character In Donkey Kong Bananza?,2025-04-07T11:00:08Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/did-nintendo-just-accidentally-reveal-an-unannounced-character-in-donkey-kong-bananza,"It looks like Nintendo Korea's website briefly gave away what sidekick may be joining Kong in the upcomingDonkey Kong Bananza.

Though the image was quickly switched out with a less revealing one, it wasn't quite quick enough forResetEra, which managed to grab a screenshot before the website was changed.
Warning!Potential Donkey Kong: Bananza spoilers follow:
In most key art associated with the game, we see Kong smashing a fist into the ground, throwing up a shower of rocks and rubble, with the purple, rock-like Odd Rock behind him. The image on the Korean website essentially showed the same, but with one key difference: Odd Rock is missing, and a young Pauline is holding on for dear life to Kong's necktie.
This is the first time Pauline's been acknowledged in any of the images, teaser trailers, or hands-on previews shown thus far, suggesting Nintendo was perhaps hoping to keep her appearance a surprise. Whoops!
More intriguingly still, Pauline's young age suggests Donkey Kong Bananza could be a prequel of some sort ‚Äî although again, Nintendo's tight-lipped on that for now.
""I think Bananza is on track to be one of the most gorgeous Nintendo games I‚Äôve seen,"" we wrote in ourDonkey Kong Bananza first hands-on preview. ""It really does take advantage of Switch 2's hardware ‚Äî the environments are beautiful and DK‚Äôs animations are wonderfully expressive, and I left feeling like the next generation of first-party Nintendo games had truly arrived.""
Now that we finally have arelease dateandtech specson the highly anticipated Switch successor, Nintendo Switch 2 ‚Äî as well as an idea ofhow much first-party Nintendo games may cost on the new system‚Äîcheck out our deep dive into all the facts as we talk to industry experts.
For more on Nintendo Switch 2, you can catch up oneverything shown at last week's Nintendo Direct. Donkey Kong Bananza comes out July 17 for $69.99, exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.

"Switch 2 Exclusive The Duskbloods' Hub Keeper Is 'Something Cute For a Change,' Because of Its Partnership With Nintendo",2025-04-04T14:37:21Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-hub-keeper-is-something-cute-for-a-change-because-of-its-partnership-with-nintendo,"FromSoftware has shared some more info about its recently announced Switch 2 exclusive,The Duskbloods. The partnership with Nintendo seemed to affect not just the style of game FromSoft is making, but even the design of the keeper of The Duskbloods' hub area into something different ‚Äî something... cute.

The trailer shown during the Switch 2 Direct this week closed on a shot of a winged rat character, with glowing glyphs drawn all over it, looking at the camera. Curious fans might have wondered what this rat's deal was. As it turns out, this is our new hub companion.
""That character shares a similar role with the fire keepers from the Dark Souls series. They remain in the hub area, providing the player with advice and guidance,"" director Hidetaka Miyazaki saidin an interview with Nintendo.
""I suppose you could say we tried doing something a little Nintendo-esque in the spirit of the partnership.""
When asked what Miyazaki means by that, he added: ""We tried something cute for a change. Although I will say this character is actually an elderly gentleman (laughter).""
FromSoftware's shrine keepers have been central figures for player's journeys through their worlds. Familiar faces like Melina, the Maiden in Black, the Doll, and others are characters you return to over and over on your trip, often offering power to help you move forward.
With a PvPvE game like The Duskbloods, though, it remains to be seen what kind of advice and guidance the winged rat will offer. Miyazaki said the team at FromSoft has tried its hands at introducing ""a lot of new and interesting ideas,"" so expect the unexpected when it hits Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026.
We've got plenty more on The Duskbloods, includingBloodborne fan reaction, andMiyazaki's comments on whether FromSoft plans to leave single-player behind.

Pok√©mon Fans Wildly Speculate On Why Legends: Z-A Has an E10+ Rating,2025-03-14T14:54:57Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-fans-wildly-speculate-on-why-legends-z-a-has-an-e10-rating,"We recently saw a good look atPok√©mon Legends: Z-A, the next entry in Game Freak's Legends series set to take place in X and Y's Lumiose City. It's also apparently garnered an E10+ rating from the ESRB, and fans are both curious and wildly, sometimes jokingly, speculating about what's going to happen in this new entry.

Attentive fans noticed that on the Nintendo Switch store page, Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A has earned an E10+ age rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board, listing 'Fantasy Violence.' While it might not normally draw feverish speculation for most other series, it's an oddity for Pok√©mon, whose mainline games have consistently been 'E for Everyone.'
The rating has, of course, drawn wild speculation, some serious and some less-than-serious. It is genuinely entertaining to think about what strange choices Game Freak could possibly have made to bump up the rating, whether that bedialogue about Pok√©mon killing peopleor trying toadd a gunplay mechanic. Asseveral Redditors (jokingly) suggest, maybe the hordes come back, but it involves a group of Scrafty jumping you in one of Lumiose's alleys.
""Ohhhh boy, Game Freak is taking off the little kiddie gloves,""Reddit user RynnHamHamsaid. ""This ain‚Äôt your kindergartener‚Äôs Pok√©mon game.""
Several gags have also been made about AZ, a character with quite a history set to appear in Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A and who plays a central role in some of the darker elements of Pok√©mon X and Y's story and the history of the Kalos region.
As for more plausible speculation, there are a few theories, includinga few more""craps"" than usual, or the appearance of a Game Center-style minigame. Even the darker elements of Lumiose could be more front-and-center.
My personal take is that this probably lies in the 'Fantasy Violence' the ESRB highlighted. While the rating is an oddity for your typical Pok√©mon game, itdoesline up with the pocket monster fighting gamePokk√©n Tournament DX, which also received an E10+ and noted 'Fantasy Violence.' The real-time elementsshowcased for Pok√©mon Legends: Z-Acould have elicited the slightly stronger rating, as the monsters more clearly make contact.
There's no listing, as of this writing, for Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A on the ESRB site, so we can't learn much more at this time. Still, it's fun to speculate a bit, at least until we know more about Z-A's ultimate plans and how it will earn that bump-up in the E range.
Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A is slated for a late 2025 launch on Nintendo Switch.

Nintendo Announces Switch 1-Focused Direct Ahead of Next Week's Switch 2 Direct,2025-03-26T14:04:42Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-switch-1-focused-direct-ahead-of-next-weeks-switch-2-direct,"Nintendo has announced a Nintendo Direct focused on the Nintendo Switch.

The direct is set for 7am PT tomorrow, March 27, and will feature around 30 minutes of upcoming games for the Nintendo Switch.
Nintendo made a point of clarifying that there will be no updates about Nintendo Switch 2 during this presentation. Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct is set for 6am PT on April 2.
Tune in tomorrow, March 27th, at 7 a.m. PT for a livestreamed#NintendoDirect, featuring around 30 minutes of upcoming games for Nintendo Switch. There will be no updates about Nintendo Switch 2 during this presentation.Watch it here:https://t.co/sJFoxe0mq0pic.twitter.com/1XeAuff5o1
So, what should fans expect from this Nintendo Direct?Nintendo still has a number of upcoming Nintendo Switch games in the workseven as it prepares to release the Switch 2. It's worth remembering the Switch has sold an incredible 150.86 million units to date. That's an enormous audience video game publishers, developers, and Nintendo itself will find it hard to ignore even with so much attention on its successor.
To that end, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still down as a 2025 Switch game, as is Professor Layton and the New World of Steam. We know Pokemon Legends: Z-A is coming to the Switch at some point this year. When the hotly anticipated Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced six years ago, Team Cherry confirmed the launch platforms as Windows, Mac, Linux, and Nintendo Switch. Switch 2 is backwards compatible, so the expectation is all these games will work on the next-gen console as well as the OG Switch.
This week's Nintendo Direct may act as a last hurrah for the Switch eight years after it came out, outlining Nintendo's final slate of exclusives as it moves on to Switch 2. But perhaps Nintendo has a few surprises up its sleeve yet.

Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition Just Dropped to an All-Time Low Price at Amazon,2025-03-17T11:49:49Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-collection-anniversary-edition-best-deal-new-2025,"Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition has hit its lowest price yet,now available for $49.99 at Amazon‚Äîits best deal to date, even beating Black Friday, according to our records, and even price-tracking siteCamelCamelCamel.

Originally released on October 8 forNintendo SwitchandPlayStation 4 (fully compatible with PS5), this collection brings together the first six mainline Final Fantasy games in their carefully remastered form. Square Enix has opted for refinement rather than reinvention, keeping the original pixelated aesthetic intact but sharpening it for modern displays.
The result is a collection that looks fantastic, whether on a massive TV or in handheld mode. The soundtrack has also received an orchestral upgrade, with legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu overseeing the new arrangements. On top of that, the package introduces a handful of thoughtful quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to disable random encounters and boost experience and gil gains‚Äîuseful for those who want to focus on the story without the grind.
As a small but nostalgic extra, this edition includes a sticker sheet featuring 12 classic character sprites, including the Black Mage, a Moogle, Terra, Kain, and a mid-cackle Kefka. It‚Äôs not the most extravagant of bonuses, but it‚Äôs a fun little touch for fans of the series.
At its original $74.99 price, the collection was a tougher sell, but at $49.99, it's a much easier recommendation for anyone interested in the series‚Äô origins. Whether you‚Äôre revisiting these classics or playing them for the first time, this is a well-executed remaster of six of themost influential RPGsever made. And with physical copies being the only collectible edition available, it might be worth picking up before they become harder to find, especially at this time.

Pick Up a Nintendo Switch Online Gift Card Before the Inevitable Price Increase,2025-04-02T18:11:33Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/pick-up-a-nintendo-switch-online-gift-card-before-the-inevitable-switch-2-price-increase,"I've had a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription for little over a year now and it's been great. I've been able to play some older Game Boy Advance games I never got to experience as a kid as well as revisit classic N64 games like Banjo-Kazooie. Now with the Switch 2 on the horizon, the Switch Online subscription is goingto start including GameCube games‚Äì plus be required to use thenew GameChat function‚Äì and I couldn't be more excited. What I'm not excited about is the increased prices for the new console and games.

Theprice of the Switch 2 was revealedto be $449.99 and thenew Mario Kart game is going to cost $80at launch. These price increases make me think that a Nintendo Switch Online price increase is probably inevitable. If you are looking to pick up a subscription for the first time, there are still gift cards available at some retailers that you can purchase now instead of later. These are only available for new subscribers and do not stack upon existing subscriptions.
These gift cards are currently available at Walmart and Target, but sold out at Amazon. These are e-gift cards that will be sent to your email where you'll be able to add the subscription to your account via code. The 12 months don't start counting down until you actually access the membership, so there's some leeway about when you start it. If you redeemed the membership right now, you would still have access when the Switch 2 launches in June this year.
Although Nintendo has not mentioned anything about a price increase to any of theSwitch Online membership plansin the U.S., it seems likely that it will happen. Prices have already started toincrease in some regionsoutside of the U.S. in 2025 and with the Switch 2 looming, it's likely we will see the same thing occuring here.
The gift card we've featured above is specifically for an individual membership. Here's everything that has been confirmed to be included as we head into the Switch 2 era."
Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Will Be a Paid Tour of Your New Nintendo Switch 2,2025-04-02T14:53:21Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-will-be-a-paid-tour-of-your-new-nintendo-switch-2,"Nintendo has announced the Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a special game launching alongside the Switch 2 to take you on a guided tour of its new hardware. Surprisingly, though, it's not a pack-in piece of software, but a separate, paid digital game.

Shown during today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is a ""virtual exhibition"" of the new hardware. Per Nintendo, ""through tech demos, minigames and other interactions, players will get to know the new system inside and out in ways they may never have known about otherwise.""
Today's Direct showed footage of a small player avatar exploring a super-sized Switch 2, reading about the different features and facts about the Nintendo Switch 2. It seems to act like a virtual museum of sorts, but also have some min-games like Speed Golf, Dodge the Spiked Balls, and a Maracas Physics Demo.
On stream and in a press release, Nintendo also confirmed the Switch 2 Welcome Tour will be available to buy from the Nintendo eShop on Switch 2's launch day.
While it's a neat tool,fans were quick to wonder whythis was a paid digital-only game and not a console pack-in for the Nintendo Switch 2. No price has been listed as of this writing.
For comparison, the Switch 2 is also launching with games like Mario Kart World, Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster, and Deltarune Chapters 1 through 4. While a showcase for the new console is certainly intriguing, it will be competing for some stretched wallets early on.
The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025at a $449.99 USD price tag, or $499.99 for the bundle including Mario Kart World.

GameCube Titles are Coming to Nintendo Switch Online with Nintendo Switch 2,2025-04-02T13:53:24Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/gamecube-titles-are-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online-with-nintendo-switch-2,"As part of today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct presentation, we learned about how Nintendo Switch Online will work on the new console, including the news everyone's been waiting for: GameCube titles are on the way.

It's a major update to the Nintendo Switch Online library that will grant subscribers access to a laundry list of classic 2000s-era titles, including The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and Soulcalibur 2, which will all be available atlaunch this summer. Of course, this library will be expanded upon in the years to come, with some teased titles including Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, Super Mario Strikers, Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, and more.
The GameCube launch lineup arrives alongside the Switch 2 this June and will be available for those who subscribe to the Expansion Pack Nintendo Switch Online tier. If you're looking to make your trip down memory lane even more nostalgic, you can pick up the newly announced wireless GameCube controller for Switch 2. It comes with a C button and arrives on the My Nintendo Store the same day as the Switch 2's launch.
We've known for a while that Nintendo Switch Online would be present on Nintendo Switch 2, and fans have been hoping ever since that we would get upgrades to the retro offerings and other features. TheExpansion Pack for Nintendo Switch Online launched in 2021, to include N64 and Sega Genesis games, and thenexpanded again in 2023 to include GBA and GameBoy games, which gave fans hope that Nintendo DS and GameCube or other might be next. We've also been holding our breath for the ultimate result of theNintendo Switch Online Playtest Program from last fall, whichleaked immediately after it went live.
Thankfully, Switch 2 owners who subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online will continue to have access to the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries for the standard tier, as well as the Sega Genesis, Nitnendo 64, and Game Boy Advance libraries for the Expansion Pack tier. For everything else we saw at today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, check outour roundup.

How Nintendo Switch 2 Will Improve Switch 1 Games,2025-04-02T21:22:06Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games,"The Nintendo Switch 2 is finally hereand as previously reported the Switch 2 will be largely backwards compatible with Switch 1 games. However, there appears to be a concerted effort from Nintendo to introduce specially enhanced versions of Switch 1 games to the Switch 2. And these seem to go beyond just a graphical boost and framerate bump.

As Nintendo breaks down, there will be primarily three types of games playable on the Switch 2.Native Switch 2 gamesthat are developed for the system and cannot be played on the original Switch. Compatible Switch 1 games whose cartridges can slot right into the Switch 2 and be played natively on the console. And Switch 2 Edition games which are Switch 1 games that will receive new features and performance enhancements when played on Switch 2.
This doesn‚Äôt include classic games that are available through Nintendo Switch Online which includes a library of games from the NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and now GameCube.
The main takeaway from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is that Nintendo appears to be trying to throw in a little extra for anyone playing a Switch 2 Edition of a Switch 1 game.
For example, Super Mario Party Jamboree was a Switch game and the Switch 2 Edition will come with a new suite of content called Jamboree TV that will take advantage of the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, Switch 2 microphone, and the Switch 2 USB-C camera that will be sold separately.
Along with upgraded resolution up to 1440p in TV mode and better frame rate, there will be new minigames and online functions as well.
Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which will be a cross-gen game, will support mouse controls with Joy-Con 2, and multiple display modes like Quality Mode which runs at 60fps in 4K when docked, or 1080p at 60fps on handheld; or Performance Mode which runs a 120fps in 1080p when docked, or 120fps in 720p in handheld mode. All modes will support HDR.
Other Switch 2 Edition titles will get new story content like Kirby and the Forgotten Land‚Äôs Star-Crossed World add-on, whileThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdomwill gain additional support for the Zelda Notes service in the Nintendo Switch App that will give you guides and game help.
Some games, like Pokemon Legends: Z-A will only feature performance and resolution bumps as part of the Switch 2 Edition label.
The Switch 2 is set to be released on June 5, 2025 and that‚Äôs around when the first batch of Switch 2 Edition games will arrive.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will get Switch 2 Editions on the day of the console‚Äôs launch on June 5, 2025.
Switch 2 Editions for Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV will arrive a little later on July 24, 2025. Same for Kirby and the Forgotten Land‚Äôs update which will arrive on August 28, 2025.
Neither Metroid Prime 4: Beyond of Pokemon Legends: Z-A have release dates yet so both Switch 2 Editions are scheduled for sometime in 2025.
That depends. If you don‚Äôt own the Switch 1 version of the game, then you can purchase the Switch 2 Edition at retail, which will be distinct thanks to the new red-colored physical game case. The digital versions will also feature a prominent Switch 2 logo so you know you‚Äôre buying the right edition for your Switch 2.
If you own the game on Switch 1 and want the upgrades that will be added in the Switch 2 Edition you will need to purchase an upgrade pack from Nintendo. The upgrade packs will be available at select retailers, the official My Nintendo Store, and Nintendo eShop. However, Nintendo has not revealed how much an upgrade pack will cost just yet.
Some upgrade packs, like the upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom will be included in a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. This is the same membership that gives Switch owners access to online features and the classic library.
So there you have it, that‚Äôs everything you need to know about the Switch 2 Editions of a game. We‚Äôve detailed previously how Nintendo is making thejump to the Switch 2 fairly seamlessthanks to its backward compatibility stance, and it looks like Nintendo is looking to bolster its launch library with improved versions of Switch classics.

"The Compact Iniu 10,000mAh USB Power Bank Just Dropped to $9.99 on Amazon",2025-03-26T20:35:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/iniu-power-bank-deal-for-nintendo-switch-and-iphone-16-1,"For a limited time, Amazon is offering the popularINIU 10,000mAh USB power bankfor just $8.99 after clipping the 10% off coupon on the product page and applying promo code ""4WJNEP2X"" during checkout. This is a new lower price than what we saw earlier this week. INIU power banks have solid reviews and are less expensive than equivalent Anker models.

This INIU power bank features a 10,000mAh (37Whr) capacity, which can charge a Nintendo Switch OLED from completely empty to full about 1.9 times, an iPhone 16 about 2.2 times, and an iPhone 16 Pro Max about 1.7 times. Note that this power bank doesn't have high speed Power Delivery, which means you're getting a maximum charging rate of about 15W. That's not quite fast enough to max out the charging rate of the iPhone or Switch (both cap at about 18-20W), it's not that much slower, and for $10 there's little reason to complain.
With a power bank this small, you don't need to worry about being stopped at airports. The 10,000mAh capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh carry-on limit. The INIU power bank is also slim and compact  so it's unlikely anyone will take notice in the first place. If a TSA official actually does take the initiative to test the wattage, you are well in the clear.

PlayStation Fans Left Disappointed After Flight Simulator 2025 Store Page Labeled 'Copycat Shovelware',2025-03-20T17:09:04Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-fans-left-disappointed-after-flight-simulator-2025-store-page-labeled-copycat-shovelware,"Fans quick to celebrate the reveal of a Microsoft Flight Simulator PlayStation Store page were left let down after it was discovered that the actual product is little more than ‚Äúcopycat shovelware.‚Äù

Xbox and PlayStation fans gathered to discuss a potential port for the popular flight simulation game afterReddit user CreativeRaspberry314 sharedTrophy information related to a potential PS4 and PS5 version earlier today. It would be exciting ‚Äì ifnot somewhat unsurprising‚Äì to see Microsoft bring more Xbox titles to PlayStation fans, butthe spotted store pageisn‚Äôt officially related to Microsoft Flight Simulator in any way, shape, or form.
‚ÄúSadly, this is just a copycat shovelware game,‚Äù oneReddit user added. ‚ÄúStraight up shovelware,‚Äù anotheradded. ‚ÄúActually mental tbh, the picture is a straight up rip-off. If it was MSFS, it'd have the same achievements as the Xbox/Steam versions.‚Äù
Instead, the Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation is being published by a company named Grizzly Games Limited. As spotted byEurogamer, the company shares a name with Thronefall developer Grizzly Games but is also completely unrelated to that entity. While that team is responsible for other titles like Superflight and Islanders, theGrizzly Games Limited websitereveals a catalog of what appear to be mobile games featuring glossy, AI-generated materials. The art for its Flight Simulator 2025 project also appears to be generated by AI judging by some of its muddy plane parts and strange designs.
The Thronefall team, meanwhile, provided a statement to Eurogamer related to the discovery of Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation and Grizzly Games Limited. Grizzly Games says it is not associated with the company, adding that it is using ‚Äúboth our name and logo illegally.‚Äù
‚ÄúFurthermore they seem to incorporate the absolute opposite of our values, of what we stand for and what we‚Äôre trying to give to the gaming community,‚Äù Grizzly Games continued. ‚ÄúUnfortunately our legal resources are limited as a two-person indie team, but honestly I'd love to see this kind of stuff being stopped, especially since it's not only happening to us but lots of indie devs that just lack the legal power.""
As of this story‚Äôs publication, the Flight Simulator 2025 page remains live on the PlayStation Store. It describes an experience that ‚Äúsets a new standard in aviation simulation, combining ultra-realistic flight dynamics with breathtaking visuals.‚Äù No gameplay for the project has been revealed.
‚ÄúCan shovelware just be banned from the store please? It‚Äôs packed to the brim with it and makes browsing an absolute chore,‚Äù anotherReddit user added. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember it being this bad in prior generations.‚Äù
PlayStationtook a standagainst what many refer to as ‚Äúspam‚Äù titles in 2022. At the time, it was believed the move was made to fight back against easy-to-Platinum games, or titles that exist almost solely for the purpose of increasing players‚Äô Platinum Trophy count. However, many shovelware titles still exist on the PlayStation Store andother digital storefrontstoday.
Webrought a magnifying glass up to the issue last monthto take a closer look at how shovelware titles impact both gamers and developers. We spoke to multiple developers to learn more about not only how these games find their way onto digital storefronts but PlayStation, Nintendo, Xbox, and Valve‚Äôs vetting process.

Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition Has Mario and Luigi-Themed Pre-Order Bonuses on Nintendo Switch 2,2025-04-02T16:43:06Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition-has-mario-and-luigi-themed-pre-order-bonuses-on-nintendo-switch-2,"The globe-trotting World of Assassination trilogy of IO Interactive's Hitman series is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 asHitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition. And alongside arriving in the Switch 2 launch window, Agent 47 will also be donning some new, appropriately Nintendo-themed duds.

OnIO Interactive's site, the developer confirmed Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition will go up for pre-order soon, for both digital and physical editions. A pre-order of the digital edition will get you the Signature Pack, which includes two red-and-white outfits for Agent 47, a golden wrench, and a mushroom. Mushroom effects unknown at this time.
Physical pre-orders, meanwhile, offer both the Signature Pack and the Quack Pack, which offers a Luigi-themed green-and-grey suit and a green rubber duck. Much like a bald guy in a red tie and suit at a Paris fashion show, nothing unusual to see here.
Less-than-subtle references aside, it's fun to see Agent 47 get some Nintendo attire. Other games likeBayonettaandThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrimgot their own Nintendo crossover cosmetics, and Agent 47 certainly has earned a bit of Nintendo theming of his own.
The World of Assassination spans a trilogy of games, as Agent 47 undertakes a number of missions to assassinate targets and complete contracts for his clientele. Starting with 2016's Hitman, the WoA trilogy runs up through Hitman III, whichIGN gave a 9, saying: ""Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is one of the barcoded butcher's best appearances.""
Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition combines all of it together into one package. This includes the main campaign, contracts mode, escalations, Elusive Target arcades, and featured live content for Hitman, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3. Also included is the Freelancer game mode, a roguelike option for those who want even more variety and options in their Hitman experience.
Currently, Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition is due to arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in June 2025. Its also available now on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, the original Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation PS VR2.

Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4 Are Launching Alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 in June,2025-04-02T13:50:26Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-launching-alongside-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-june,"Toby Fox has been a busy guy. During today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, the small white dog dev showed the first full trailer for Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4, revealing that chapters 3 and 4 will launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5. It will also be available on all other platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.

Deltarune's first two chapters are mysterious little RPGs following a character named Kris through their adventures in a ""Dark World"" with their classmate Suzie and a prince named Ralsei. They borrow a number of characters and themes from Fox's previous work, Undertale, but thus far it's been unclear if there's any relationship between the two stories. Trailers lately have been referring to it as a ""parallel"" story to Undertale.
In today's trailer, we got our first-ever look at Chapters 3 and 4, though the look was cryptic as is Fox's wont. There was a brief look at the Castle Town with all the characters we've met so far hanging out together (including Queen!), a new battle that looked like some sort of rock show with Guitar Hero-like controls, Suzie throwing Kris into what looks like a chapel with both characters slightly off-color, and a look at two new villains. One, for Chapter 3, appears to be a creepy smile in a static-y TV (recalling the tease at the end of Chapter 2), and the other, a bit less comprehensibly, seems to be a pile of...weird jellyfish? That Suzie and Kris are running from? No idea.
Deltarune has thus far been released chapter by chapter, with chapter 1 coming out on Halloween 2018, and Chapter 2 debuting in September of 2021. Both of the first chapters were free. The total number of chapters is still unknown, but the menu screen has previously seemed to hold room for seven total, meainng that two more may be on the way. The anticipation for these latest chapters has only grown in the last year, withFox confirming last Halloween that 3 and 4would ""100% come out in 2025"". The Nintendo Switch 2 version will include all four chapters, including the two previously released.
Though we haven't yet reviewed the beginnings of Deltarune, we gave Fox's previous game, Undertale, arare 10/10, calling it a ""masterfully crafted experience.""

Nintendo Uses Its New App to Announce the Release Date of the Live-Action the Legend of Zelda Movie,2025-03-28T13:23:34Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-uses-its-new-app-to-announce-the-release-date-of-the-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie,"Nintendo has announcedthe live-action The Legend of Zelda movielaunches on March 26, 2027.

Confirmation comes fromthe recently released Nintendo Today! app, which was unveiled during theNintendo Direct March 2025. No other information on the movie was revealed.
Video game legend Shigeru Miyamoto spilled the beans on the company‚Äôs latest news push as a last-minute stinger during the showcase. This all-in-one phone application comes with a variety of perks for die-hard Nintendo fans to be aware of.
This hub for all things Nintendo serves as a daily calendar and news machine to drip feed information directly to players as it happens. Miyamoto used the example that, after the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct premieres next week, fans will be able to log into the Nintendo Today app to catch all of the updates, with more news arriving ‚Äúdaily‚Äù from there.
But the big news has started early, with the Zelda movie release date confirmation sure to drive plenty of fans to download the app hoping for similarly seismic announcements in the days to come. It was telling that Nintendo's news app was first with the Zelda movie news, ahead of the company's own social media channels.
Nintendo and Sony Pictures first made the massive announcement about a live-action The Legend of Zelda movie in November 2023, with Wes Ball (The Maze Runner, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes) set to direct and Avi Arad and Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto producing.
We know next to nothing about the movie itself, though.Ball has said he wants it to be ""live action Miyazaki,""referencing beloved filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, the director of Studio Ghibli and creator of myriad anime classics such as My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle, and Spirited Away. Ball stillplans for the Zelda movie to be a ""serious"" adaptationthat feels real, and has made clearhe doesn't intend to use much motion capturein the ""grounded"" film.

How to Increase Your Chance of Getting a New Nintendo Switch 2 Console on Day One,2025-04-01T20:09:25Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tips-for-successfully-preordering-in-2025,"Nintendo has officially unveiled the Switch 2 in asuper-sized 60-minute Nintendo Direct. While preorders were originally set toopen on April 9 in the US, new tariffs led to aSwitch 2 preorder delay. When preorders will go live is still up in the air. However, Nintendo said the tariffs won't affect the Switch 2's launch date, which is still scheduled for June 5, 2025. Initially, Nintendo announced the upcomingconsole would cost $449.99alone, or $499.99 bundled with Mario Kart World (a game thatwill retail for $79.99if bought separately). However, the developing tariff situation will likely end up affecting the price, so a lot is still up in the air at the moment.

üí• Don't forget tobookmark our Switch 2 pre-order guidefor the latest updates & be the first to know about where you can buy the new Switch!üí•
If you‚Äôre hoping to secure a Switch 2 on day one, you‚Äôll want to act fast. Nintendo is offering aregistration system through My Nintendo Store, where invites to purchase will be sent out on a first-come, first-served basis. Priority will go to Nintendo Switch Online members with at least 12 months of paid membership and 50+ gameplay hours as of April 2, 2025.
All major retailers are also expected to open up preorders on April 9, 2025, as well. With demand expected to be high, here are some key tips from the IGN commerce team to improve your chances of getting a Switch 2 at launch.
Since the Switch 2 preodrer situation is still developing, news could break at any time. Plus, when a major piece of gaming hardware goes up for preorder at a retailer, there‚Äôs no telling how long it will be available. We‚Äôve seen sought-after hardwaresell out in seconds. The best and most reliable way to know when a listing goes live is to followIGN Deals on XorBlueskyand keep an eye on those accounts in real time. (Wario64andCAGare also reliable sources of real-time information).
From now through the launch on June 5, 2025 and beyond, we‚Äôll keep followers posted on any preorder news. And when preorders go live ‚Äì whenever that happens to be ‚Äì we'll post links the moment they become available.
There‚Äôs no point in clicking a live preorder link early if you‚Äôre not logged in. The precious seconds it takes to enter your login name and password could make the difference between you getting a Nintendo Switch 2 at launch and not. The retailers below are all likely to have Switch 2 preorders, so create an account if you have to, and make sure you‚Äôre logged in and ready before Switch 2 preorders go live.
The next step is to make sure your credit card info is entered in at the above retailers so you don‚Äôt have to type numbers with your excited fingers as everyone else on the planet buys a Switch 2 before you can.
With big ticket items like the Switch 2, the preorder links rarely go live at the same time across all the retailers. Often, Best Buy's link goes up first, followed a few minutes later by GameStop and Walmart. Amazon is usually the wild card of the bunch, sometimes going live hours (or even days) later. So if you miss the chance to preorder from one retailer, stay tuned to see if others will have Switch 2 preorders in stock a little later.
There's even a chance a given retailer will get additional preorders after its initial stock has run out. And even if you miss out preordering at all of the retailers, local brick-and-mortar stores may get stock on launch day. And failing that, even if stock is scarce at launch, Nintendo will catch up with demand at some point, so remain steadfast.
Anytime a hard-to-buy piece of gaming hardware goes up for preorder, out come the opportunists. You can bet shady sites and resellers on eBay will be primed and ready to capitalize on this moment. Some sites will make their original Switch stockseemlike Switch 2 stock. Others will take their actual Switch 2 preorders, crank the price sky high, and re-sell them at a massive profit. If you fail to secure a Switch 2 preorder at a legit retailer when they go live, please don‚Äôt pay large sums of money to these people looking to make an easy buck. It‚Äôs almost always better to wait until more stock becomes available at a site you trust.
In case you missed it, here's the full rundown of what wasannounced at the latest Nintendo Switch 2 Directon April 1st:

"AU Deals: Fifty Bucks Off Batman and a Meta 3S, Low Gil Prices for Final Fantasies, and More!",2025-03-31T00:02:46Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/au-deals-fifty-bucks-off-batman-and-a-meta-3s-low-gil-prices-for-final-fantasies-and-more,"Looking to score some killer discounts on top-tier games and gear? This week‚Äôs deals slash prices on some truly legendary titles across Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5. Let‚Äôs dive into the best of the bunch before they disappear.

In retro news, I'm lighting a 30th birthday cake forIndiana Jones' Greatest Adventures, a SNES treasure that belongs in your museum. Developed by Factor 5 and published by JVC/LucasArts, this SNES gem took the tried-and-trueSuper Star Warsformula and applied it toRaiders of the Lost Ark,The Temple of Doom, andThe Last Crusade. With tight controls, detailed sprite work, and a John Williams-fueled chiptune soundtrack, this was a must-have for 16-bit adventurers.
Back in the day, it was pretty amazing stuff to become Indy as he punched, whipped, and jumped his way through jungles, temples, mines, and deserts‚Äîall while avoiding Nazis, cultists, and booby traps. The level variety was impressive, with bonus segments including mine cart chases, boulder dashes, and even some Mode7 dogfighting in a biplane.

Nintendo Switch 2 Gets Upgraded Red Game Cards and MicroSD Express Storage Support,2025-04-02T13:32:26Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-gets-upgraded-red-game-cards-and-microsd-express-storage-support,"Nintendo Switch 2 features new game cards that come with a sleek new red look and faster data reading speeds.

Nintendo dived into the details on how physical game cards will work for its upcoming console during today‚Äôs special Switch 2 Direct. In addition to a first look at these updated game cards, the company detailed how additional storage will work.
The Switch 2 will only becompatible with microSD Express Cards, meaning you won‚Äôt be able to bring your old storage cards over when you pick up the console this summer. SanDisk has its128GB($44.99), and256GB MicroSD Express Cards($59.99) already available on Amazon.
No one was surprised to see Nintendo showcase how the Switch 2 ups the ante with new features and games, but we also got a good look at some of the controllers it will support. An updated pro controller is one of the new tools players can use to better enjoy the next generation of Nintendo gaming, as it comes with a variety of upgrades, including a C button located between the d-pad and right analog stick, GR and GL back bumper triggers, and an audio jack.
Today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct also cleared the air about how data transferring will work, with the company explaining that a new feature will allow original Switch owners to bring over their old save data, and digital games to Switch 2. For a better look at everything else Nintendo had to show during today‚Äôs Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, you can clickhere.

So What About Joy-Con Stick Drift on the Nintendo Switch 2? Nintendo Responds,2025-04-03T13:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/so-what-about-joy-con-stick-drift-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-responds,"Anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch will know about Joy-Con stick drift. It‚Äôs when the Joy-Con Control Sticks stop responding correctly, or suffer from ""drifting.""

Complaints aboutJoy-Con driftwere so loud that Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa apologized for the ""inconvenience"" and launched a free repair program. Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has talked about the ""battle against"" Joy-Con drift, insisting Nintendo was making continuous improvements. It was such a big problem that parents in the U.S. tried to sue over Joy-Con drift in a class-action lawsuit, although Nintendo ended up fending that off.
In 2022, a UK consumer group allegedNintendo Switch's Joy-Con drift issue was caused by a fundamental design flaw. A report from Which claimed that, even after just a few months of use, the Joy-Con's plastic circuit boards show significant wear on the joystick slider contact points,causing Joy-Con drift.
This week, Nintendo fully unveiled the $449.99 Switch 2 in a Nintendo Direct, showing off the new Joy-Con 2 and its extra functionality. InNintendo Switch 2 tech specspublished by the company, there is no detail on the sticks themselves. So as of now, we don‚Äôt know for sure if Joy-Con 2 use the hall effect sensors Nintendo fans are desperate for.
As Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto described in a new 'Ask the Developer' interview, the Switch 2's Joy-Cons have ‚Äúlarger and more durable‚Äù analog sticks ‚Äúwith smoother movement.‚Äù
It was a similarly vague response when Nintendo was asked about Joy-Con drift improvements at a hardware-focused roundtable Q&A in New York yesterday, attended by IGN.
Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo‚Äôs Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, told the assembled media that the new Joy-Con 2 controllers were redesigned ‚Äúfrom the ground up,‚Äù but failed to say anything specific about drifting.
‚ÄúAs you may have witnessed and felt, the new Joy-Con 2 controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been really designed from the ground up, from scratch, and they've been designed to have bigger movement and also smoother movement,‚Äù Sasaki said.
In the 'Ask the Developer' interview, Kawamoto talked about the new Switch 2 Pro Controller and its sticks, saying they‚Äôre ""quieter.""
‚ÄúAside from the color, the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller may look indistinguishable from the previous controller at first glance, but it was also redesigned from scratch,‚Äù Kawamoto explained.
‚ÄúIn particular, the left and right control sticks are quieter and don‚Äôt make noise, even when they‚Äôre moved quickly to the edge. Also, they glide very smoothly, so we've taken to calling them ‚Äòsmooth-gliding sticks.‚Äô (Laughs)‚Äù
Sasaki added: ""As they‚Äôre calling them ‚Äòsmooth-gliding sticks,‚Äô we made efforts to reduce the feeling of bumping when you tilt them. In fact, there's been a long-running project at Nintendo with the grand ambition of developing the ‚Äòpinnacle of all controllers,‚Äô and we‚Äôve been researching it hard for a long time now.‚Äù
The proof of the pudding is in the eating, of course. We won‚Äôt know how the Switch 2 Joy-Con hold up under strain perhaps until years after the console comes out. But hopefully, based on what Nintendo is saying now, Joy-Con drift will be a thing of the past.

Nintendo Is Making the Jump to Switch 2 as Easy as Possible for Everyone,2025-03-30T13:45:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-is-making-the-jump-to-switch-2-as-easy-as-possible-for-everyone,"Ever since Nintendo officially revealed the Switch 2, all eyes have been on the upcoming April Direct. That‚Äôs when we‚Äôll presumably get an official Switch 2 release date, price, and confirmed line-up of games. So the last thing I was expecting was for Nintendo to dropanotherDirect the week before then, packed with big names like Pok√©mon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4. But maybe given Nintendo‚Äôs commitments to backward compatibility, I shouldn‚Äôt be too surprised.

Prior to this week‚Äôs Nintendo Direct, Nintendo was careful to temper expectations by declaring ‚ÄúThere will be no updates about Nintendo Switch 2 during the presentation.‚Äù While that‚Äôs technically true ‚Äì Switch 2 wasn‚Äôt mentioned apart from a reminder about the upcoming Direct and the new Virtual Game Card sharing system ‚Äì it‚Äôs not a huge leap to say that everything we saw this week will be playable on the Switch 2, even if, officially, thesegames are coming to the original Switch.
It‚Äôs a win-win situation for everyone involved - those sticking with the OG Switch still have plenty to be excited about as the console enters its eighth year, and anyone upgrading to Switch 2 can do so safe in the knowledge it will have an extensive back catalogue of games right from the get-go.
Nintendo‚Äôs commitment to backward compatibility is contributing to what I think will be one of the smoothest transitions we‚Äôve ever seen between console generations. Of course, most are excited to see what the Switch 2 can do and what new games are incoming, but byplaying it safe with the hardware, Nintendo has all bases covered. Based on the most recent Nintendo Direct, you wouldn‚Äôt think Nintendo is trying to sell as many Switch 2 pre-orders in the run-up to launch and convince people to upgrade. And that inclusive approach should be applauded. Nintendo is essentially saying everyone is welcome, whether you‚Äôre looking to buy a Switch 2 at launch, upgrade further down the line, or are content to keep the Switch you already own.
That‚Äôs why there was no risk in showcasing the multitude of Switch games less than a week before a dedicated Switch 2 Direct drops, even when just beneath the surface of the Direct Nintendo was putting down even more groundwork for the coming succession. I‚Äôm talking aboutthe Virtual Game Card system, which is an update that allows Switch owners to link two consoles together and share digital games. It‚Äôs a useful feature, especially with digital games sales on the rise, and it‚Äôs similar to the family sharing system Steam has. But why announce it at the very end of the Switch life cycle when the Switch 2 is literally weeks or months away? Presumably to make the transition to Switch 2 even smoother.
Some have pointed out that the fine print for the Virtual Game Card indicates the existence of a ‚ÄúSwitch 2 Edition‚Äù for certain games. Whether that means there are exclusive enhancements to Switch 2 Edition games that make them unshareable with the older Switch, exclusive re-releases that will only work on Switch 2, or something else entirely, is still a mystery. But in the same way Nintendo said ‚ÄúCertain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported or fully compatible with Switch 2‚Äù when it was announced, this fine print likely covers Nintendo‚Äôs bases in the case of there being any unshareable games.
Whatever that fine print means, it feels like Nintendo is treating the road to Switch 2 almost like a procession, a bit like the way Apple moves from one iPhone to the next. You don‚Äôt have to upgrade but there are definitely benefits if you do, and you can bring whatever games you had before along for the ride.

"Nintendo Switch 2 Supports 120fps, Up to 4K Resolution Docked",2025-04-02T13:25:27Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-supports-120fps-up-to-4k-resolution-docked,"It feels like we've been speculating for years about what the specs of Nintendo's long-rumored Nintendo Switch upgrade might be. Now that we finally know, the results are a bit more impressive than many would have thought, including supporting 120fps and up to 4K resolution when the system is docked.

In a segment during today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo showed off a number of elements of the system. For starters, the Nintendo Switch 2 has a bigger built-in screen than the Switch 1, at 7.9 inches. It's the same thickness (13.9mm), but with about double the pixels, supporting a 1080p screen in handheld at up to 120fps. And it's an LCD screen, supporting HDR. Docked, it can support up to 4K resolution and HDR as well.
The Joy-Con 2 controllers are connected via magnets and detached by pressing a release button on the back. The SL and SR buttons on the side are bigger, so they're easier to play with horizontally, and the left and right sticks are also larger. And this segment officially revealed the mouse control support in the Joy-Con controllers, too.
The handheld Switch 2 has a built-in microphone with noise canceling technology and 3D audio for compatible games. And it has a larger, sturdier stand than the Nintendo Switch that can be adjustible to different heights. There's also top USB port that can be used for external camera connectivity, or to charge the system while in tabletop mode.
Finally, we learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage.
The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, and will cost $449.99 USD, or $499.99 if you buy a bundle with Mario Kart World. You can catch up on everything announced at the Nintendo Direct todayright here.

Kirby Air Riders Revealed During Nintendo Switch 2 Direct,2025-04-02T14:09:35Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-revealed-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct,"Kirby‚Äôs racing spinoff Kirby Air Ride is making a tremendous comeback after more than 20 years, thanks to a new entry for Nintendo Switch 2:Kirby Air Riders.

The project made its grand debut during today‚Äôs special Switch 2 presentation, revealing a cast of colorful Kirbys and new spacey vehicles to travel with. No gameplay was revealed, with Nintendo instead choosing to reveal the project with a cinematic trailer and the promise of a 2025 release window. We likely won't have to wait too long to see how the sequel builds on the original GameCube game, but we can at least rest easy knowing Kirby creator and Super Smash Bros. mastermind Masahiro Sakurai is serving as the project's director.
You can see the Kirby Air Riders reveal trailer below.
Nintendo released its originalKirby Air Ridespinoff for GameCube players in 2003. It's an off-the-wall entry for the all-powerful pink hero that sees him trading out platforming challenges for fast-paced racing gameplay. It's unclear how exactly Kirby Air Riders will shake up the formula, but after more than two decades of waiting, Sakurai and his team will surely have plenty to reveal at a later date.
The last original new Kirby game was Kirby and the Forgotten Land for Nintendo Switch. This was Kirby's first adventure in a full 3D perspective, andwe gave it an 8/10. We said that it ""successfully warps the series‚Äô already fun mix of ability-based combat, platforming, and secret hunting into the third dimension. The post-apocalyptic setting may not be as thematically interesting as Planet Popstar, but it is still lovely and vibrant, with cleverly designed levels that make consistently smart use of Kirby‚Äôs abilities.""
The Switch 2 is currently scheduled tolaunch June 5, 2025. You can catch up on everything announced at today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct righthere.

Every Luigi Game on the Nintendo Switch in 2025,2025-03-21T20:36:01Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/all-luigi-games-on-nintendo-switch-in-order,"As any younger sibling who grew up on Mario platformers knows, Luigi is gaming's ultimate Player 2. Nintendo's green-capped member of the Mario Bros. has lived a lifetime in the shadow of his older twin Mario, only stepping out for a taste of solo stardom in his ghostbusting Luigi's Mansion series.

As we move closer toSwitch 2, we‚Äôre celebrating another console generation of Luigi and Player 2s everywhere with a complete list of every Luigi game on Switch.
There are 17 games on Switch that let you play as Luigi. He‚Äôs the main character in only two games (Luigi‚Äôs Mansion 2 HD and Luigi‚Äôs Mansion 3) and the co-lead in one (Mario & Luigi: Brothership).
Luigi‚Äôs first starring role on Switch was inLuigi‚Äôs Mansion 3, the third entry in the character‚Äôs only solo series to date. Luigi‚Äôs Mansion 3 sees our timid hero and his green gooey clone team up with Professor E. Gadd to battle ghosts and save his friends from King Boo‚Äôs haunted hotel.
Luigi‚Äôs Mansion 2 HDis a remake of the 2013 Nintendo 3DS game Luigi‚Äôs Mansion: Dark Moon. This second game in the spooky series sees Luigi ghostbusting his way through the mansions of Evershade Valley to once again capture King Boo and save his brother.
Sure, it's not exclusively a 'Luigi game,' butMario & Luigi: Brothershipcertainly puts the brothers on even footing. Brothership is the first release in the Mario & Luigi series since Paper Jam in 2014. Players take on the role of both brothers, who must traverse puzzles and platforming challenges to restore the kingdom of Concordia.
The first Switch game to feature Luigi as a playable character wasMario Kart 8 Deluxe. Luigi appears as a middleweight racer with a well-balanced stat distribution that slightly favors speed and handling. His appearance in an ad for the original Wii U version of Mario Kart 8 spawned theLuigi Death Stare meme.
Luigi next appeared in the Nintendo-Ubisoft collaborationMario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. The tactical RPG features both Luigi and Rabbid Luigi, a Rabbid who dresses (and often behaves) like his human counterpart, as possible party members.
Luigi hit the court as one of 16 playable launch characters in 2018‚ÄôsMario Tennis Aces. As is often true for Luigi in Mario sports games, he‚Äôs a balanced, ‚Äúall-around‚Äù character in Aces. His specialty shot, Pipe Cannon, blasts him into the air to set him up for a powerful spike.
Luigi is one of 20 playable characters inSuper Mario Party. The younger of the Mario Bros. has appeared alongside his brother in every Mario Party game to date, including the two others further down this list. This is the first Mario Party game released for Switch and Nintendo‚Äôs ninth best-selling game on the platform,according to the company.
Luigi appears inSuper Smash Bros. Ultimateas an unlockable character. He is one of 12 characters to be playable in all five Smash games. According toLumiRank‚Äôs2025 tier list, which compiled the opinions of 93 ranked Smash players, Luigi is an A+-tier fighter and the 18th best overall.
Luigi is a playable character in the 2019 platformerNew Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe. This is an expanded version of NSMBU for Wii U that includes the expansion New Super Luigi U. Luigi stars as the main character in this expansion, which incorporates his higher jump, remixes levels from the base game, and adds a 100-second timer to each level.
Alongside Mario, Toad, and Toadette, Luigi is one of four playable characters inSuper Mario Maker 2. The level-building platformer allows players to create their own Mario levels using assets from Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, New Super Mario Bros. U, and Super Mario 3D World.
Like the original Wii U release,Super Mario 3D World + Bowser‚Äôs Furycan be played entirely as Luigi. Here, he controls similarly to Mario, albeit with a slightly higher jump and slightly less traction, making him play a bit more ‚Äòfloaty‚Äô and ‚Äòslippery‚Äô than his red-capped counterpart.
Luigi hit the links with Mario and friends inMario Golf: Super Rush. One of 22 playable characters, he boasts decent control and excellent speed stats, making him a great option for Super Rush‚Äôs new Speed Golf mode. His special shot, Ice Flower Freeze, freezes the ground upon the ball‚Äôs impact, creating a hazardous area for opponents.
Luigi returns for the second iteration of Mario Party on Switch:Mario Party Superstars. Unlike Super Mario Party before it, Superstars is not an original game but rather a modern collection of minigames, boards, and mechanics from the series‚Äô past.
Mario Strikers: Battle League Football, the latest Mario soccer/football game, features Luigi as one of 16 playable characters. Luigi is a well-balanced footballer who excels in technique, a skill that determines a character‚Äôs ability to dribble, curve their shot, and shoot accurately.
Luigi (and Rabbid Luigi) returned for Ubisoft and Nintendo‚Äôs tactical sequel,Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Luigi is labeled a Sneak Attacker due to his ranged weaponry and low health.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the latest 2D Mario platformer, features Luigi as a playable alternative to Mario. The difference between the two characters here is purely aesthetic, as the Mario Bros. play identically to one another.
Unsurprisingly, Luigi is playable inSuper Mario Party Jamboree, the biggest and arguably best game in Nintendo‚Äôs flagship party series. In addition to being a playable character, Luigi appears as part of Jamboree‚Äôs new Buddy mechanic, where he has the chance to change a player‚Äôs dice rolls from their initial numbers to 10s.
The next time you'll be able to play as Luigi is anew Mario Kart game, expected to release alongside theSwitch 2, that features double the usual amount of racers. Yes, that means24 racerson each track. Otherwise, I'm sure Mario will bring Luigi along for whatever his next adventure is. Plenty more games arerumoredto be releasing with Nintendo's next console generation, and the next updates will likely come out of aNintendo Direct scheduled for April 2.

Switch 2 Exclusive The Duskbloods: 7 Things We Learned From Nintendo's Interview with Director Hidetaka Miyazaki,2025-04-04T16:52:48Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-7-things-we-learned-from-nintendos-interview-with-director-hidetaka-miyazaki,"FromSoftware unveiled a new exclusive for Nintendo's new console during this week's Switch 2 Direct.The Duskbloodshad an ominous trailer, showing lots of action, horrors, and magic. In a new interview, we're now learning much more about FromSoft's plans for this multiplayer experience.

Nintendo posted athree-part interview serieswith The Duskbloods director Hidetaka Miyazaki, going over what The Duskbloods is, and how it's different from other FromSoftware games.
Despite the multiplayer PvPvE focus, Miyazaki has assured fans thatFromSoftware will keep making single-player focused games. But with The Duskbloods, the studio is experimenting, with everything from general game type tohaving a cute hub keeper.
Here are some of the major takeaways we've learned about The Duskbloods from this new set of interviews.
While the name, aesthetic, and constant mention of blood might bring to mindanother FromSoftware title, Miyazaki said The Duskbloods refers to the Bloodsworn themselves. These Bloodsworn‚Äîthe characters players control‚Äîare people who have achieved superhuman abilities through special blood, similar to vampires.
""We tried to extract the sort of romantic aspects we found interesting from concepts such as vampires and 'blood' and reinterpreted them as the Bloodsworn,"" Miyazaki said.
The Duskblood is a collective term for these characters, who all partake in a bid for First Blood, which flows during an event known as the ""Twilight of Humanity.""
Because the Twilight of Humanity takes place across different times and locales, there is no ""fixed era or location"" to pin down when or where The Duskbloods takes place.
""There are more traditional Gothic- or Victorian-style maps as well as those depicting the closing years of the early modern period, like the one glimpsed in the trailer with the train running through it,"" Miyazaki said.
In a manner that sounds similar to the upcoming Elden Ring Nightreign, players can choose from ""over a dozen"" characters in The Duskbloods. Each character can also be customized, and you'll swap between those options in a main hub area.
While characters will each have their own abilities, it sounds like some skills are universal. The Bloodsworn fighters are essentially superhuman, so they can sprint, super jump, and double jump. Additionally, every character is equipped with ""some means of attacking from a distance,"" which Miyazaki said he feels is one of The Duskblood's ""unique aspects"" when compared with previous FromSoftware games.
A key component of The Duskbloods is the PvPvE set-up. Online matches support up to eight players, vying for a win. Miyazaki said online matches are ""generally"" last player standing, but there are ""certain cases where victory conditions differ."" He gave the example of players being tasked with teaming up to take down a powerful boss, or ""other special circumstances.""
""Regardless of whether it‚Äôs PvP or PvE, the idea is to provide players with an experience that allows them to learn and hone their skills as they play,"" Miyazaki said. ""We‚Äôve therefore designed the PvE boss encounters to present a tough challenge and a sense of accomplishment upon defeating them.""
Obtaining ""Victory Points,"" which ultimately decide the outcome of a match, can happen in a few different ways. Direct combat is one, but engaging in more ""opportunistic behavior"" is also an option. And Miyazaki noted that when players return to the hub after a match, they receive a reward whether they won or lost.
There will be world events through the event system, which has the potential to shake up a match. This can range from special enemy spawns to additional objectives, all with bonus rewards offered.
Miyazaki drew attention to a portion of The Duskbloods trailer, where a giant stone face loomed in the sky. ""This is one example of the events that can occur in a match,"" Miyazaki said. ""In this case, the appearance of this stone face affects the environment and changes match rewards, which can have an immediate impact on player motivations and objectives.""
While First Blood is something worth chasing, Miyazaki said there will also be ""personal objectives"" to provide separate rewards for players.
It's unclear whether these fully tie into another system Miyazaki also mentioned, called ""roles."" While online, roles offer players unique circumstances and opportunities to interact with each other. He outlined a few examples, like the ""Destined Rival,"" which tasks a player with finding and defeating another player. Doing this will count as a personal goal, separate from the overall victory conditions.
Roles can be assigned to characters through customization, so players can roleplay a bit and, as Miyazaki said, add to the ""drama"" of these engagements.
FromSoftware is no stranger to putting some deep lore in its games. And there will, of course, be lore in The Duskbloods.
""One thing I love doing in any game I direct is leaving fragments of lore and worldbuilding details, allowing the player the fun of using their imagination to make connections,"" Miyazaki said. ""The Duskbloods is no exception to this.""
However, for The Duskbloods, Miyazaki said the team is going about it a little differently from previous games. Fragments are found in character customization items, the ""blood history and fate."" Customizing characters, analyzing and altering their blood history and fate, will reveal more information about the world and its story.
""Focusing these elements on the concept of 'blood' or 'blood history and fate' allowed for a deeper exploration of customization and is another reason we placed the Bloodsworn as the protagonists,"" Miyazaki said.
FromSoftware is certainly painting an interesting picture, but we'll have to wait a little bit to see the image fully realized, as The Duskbloods is currently planned to be a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive sometime in 2026.

Switch 2 Will Be Nintendo's Best Ever Console From Day One,2025-03-23T13:30:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-will-be-nintendos-best-console,"This is a guest column fromNintendo Life, the world‚Äôs most-visited independent Nintendo website. It covers the world of Nintendo from all angles: the games, hardware, and history with in-depth reviews and features, and also the fan community, culture, and conversation that‚Äôs formed around gaming‚Äôs most beloved company and characters.

For Nintendo fans the world over, time seems to be passing slower than ever. Sincethe January revealof Switch 2 (the official Nintendo one, notthe leaksweeks before) we've all been crossing days off the calendar counting down tothe April Nintendo Direct, when we'll finally get a proper deep dive at the hardware, a look at new games, and perhaps even a release date. Well, hopefully.
Ravenous as we are for solid Switch 2 details ‚Äî ones that don't come from coverage-hungry case manufacturers or a 17-second peek of a newMario Kart‚Äî there's one I‚Äôm confident of: from day one, Switch 2 will be the ultimate Nintendo console.
I can already sense some '?' Blocks popping off but hear me out ‚Äì even at this early stage it's hard to argue that Switch 2 won't be the ultimate portal for Nintendo games past, present, and future.
It's largely thanks to Nintendo Switch Online and the huge, historic catalogue steadily assembled sinceSeptember 2018. You get access to 182 games with a regular sub, or a whopping 290 with the 'Expansion Pack'. It‚Äôs not just Nintendo games either, the 47-strong selection ofSEGA Mega Drive/Genesis gamescovers some of that system's absolute best too. Plus the rubbishVirtua Fighter 2port.
Hey, they can't all be winners, but from classics to cult curios (seriously, check out the late-cycleSutte Hakkunfor Super Famicom if you haven't already), NSO is a vast buffet of historical video game nuggets served on a single handy device, a perfect introduction for younger gamers unfamiliar with the olden days. Grizzled vets can baulk at the idea of whippersnappers not having playedYoshi's IslandorOcarina of TimeorGoldenEye>Bunker>Power Weapons - no Oddjob, but time marches on and it's only natural. NSO's boon is offering so many iconic, formative games on a platter. We can debate the quality of the emulation (and we have), butthe library is impressive, despite gaps, and it's still growing.
That's all before we get to backwards compatibility with the current console; its lineup of series-bests should almost all be playable on the new Switch. Calls of recency bias will ring out for a generation or two yet, but the towering quality ofBreath of the Wildand its direct sequel Tears of the Kingdom,Super Mario OdysseyandSuper Mario Bros. Wonder,Animal Crossing: New Horizons,Splatoon 3,Pikmin 4, theMetroids, theXenoblades,and more is undeniable. If they're not the pinnacle of their respective series, they're in the conversation, and they'll all almost definitely be playable on Switch 2.
But what about third parties? What about indies?The specifics are hazy at this stage, but we're assuming that everything's coming over, so historians can still access Hamster's enormousArcade Archivesseries and Digital Eclipse's masterful work on various collections, not to mention its excellentGold Masterline.
The vast ocean of incredible indie games should speak for itself at this stage; one of Nintendo's greatest strengths this gen has been fully embracing the community of smaller devs. More surprisingly, Switch has also held its own with larger third-party devs, too, and signs point to that support expanding on Switch 2, and that includes games from other platform holders.
Switch isn't far off becoming a brilliantPlayStation history lesson, and even first-party Sony is starting to turn up withMLBandLEGO Horizon. Throw in potential support from Microsoft withCall of Dutyandrumours of other ports, plus the wider world of modern games and other firms eager to mitigate rising production costs across multiple platforms, and we're entering an era of unprecedented cross-platform support. Another win for anybody with a Switch 2.
There's also the small matter of whatever Nintendo's got bubbling on the stove in its Kyoto kitchens. Internal devs have been beavering away while partner studios have handled most first-party output since Mario Wonder. I'm expecting the biggest hitters on Nintendo's bench to come out swinging in April. A 3D Mario, naturally (it's the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros., remember), but anything except a full-blown 3D Zelda is possible. And there area couple of potential Wii U portsthat could tide us over nicely in the Hylian department, too.
Switch sales have slowed dramaticallyin the last year- not unexpectedly considering the system's age (it's going into itsninthyear in March). As any Captain F. Obvious can tell you, Nintendo needs the energy, excitement, and profit that new hardware generates, but day-one demand is likely to be colossal. Stockpiling inventory makes eminent sense, even ifanalysts, investors, and fans alikeare gagging for it ASAP.
Could the next mainline Mario be total toilet? Of course. Past evidence suggests it'll probably be quite good, though, and Switch 2 will likely have other quite good games. Nintendo's software batting average isquite good.
Even considering that history, though, Switch is the only console I remember buying on launch day. I got a Wii in its first month, but I'd never walked out of a store carrying the new hotness on the very first day before. It worked out rather well but a day-one purchase felt like a real gamble given the fate of Wii U, even for a card-carrying Nintendophile desperate to play BOTW on the bus.
Conversely,thisNintendo console feels like the surest possible bet for fans of the medium, even knowing practically nothing about its launch lineup. The historical library that took years to build up on previous systems is all just going to be there!
Well, almost all. As Nintendo hasmentioned(though not yet detailed), there will be""exceptions"". A background graphic on its website showsvarious games presumably playable; the likelihood is that onlyoutliersemploying peripherals and modes involving the IR sensor will be technically incompatible. Pour one out forLabo.
Beyond that, all signs point to Switch 2 being a brilliantly comprehensive overview of Nintendo history from launch day. Despite many unanswered questions, and not forgetting my professional obligation to get involved from the beginning (a golden excuse, granted), the possibility of buyer's remorse has never been lower for a Nintendo console. I've never been more eager to get stuck in on day one.
Whenever that is.

"Nintendo Switch 2: 23 New Details - Release Date, Price, GameChat and More!",2025-04-02T16:50:22Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-23-new-details-release-date-price-gamechat-and-more,"There was aton of new info to take in from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. Luckily, we‚Äôve picked out the most important details about the console, including when you can play it and the technology behind it, in this handy article. So, let‚Äôs get straight to it. Here are 23 new details about the Switch 2 console and its new GameChat feature.

1. Let‚Äôs start with the big one. We finally now know that theNintendo Switch 2 will arrive on June 5th, 2025.
2. It will beavailable to pre-orderon April 8th in the UK and Europe, but one day later on the 9th in the US.
3. The Switch 2 is a larger version of the original hybrid console, with the screen measuring 7.9 inches ‚Äì a considerable increase compared to the Switch‚Äôs 6.2 inches.
4. The screen itself is a 1080p LCD monitor, with double the amount of pixels of the original screen. It also supports HDR (High Definition Range) and 120fps for an even smoother gameplay experience.
5.4K resolution will be available on Switch 2 when dockedand a suitable TV is connected via HDMI. The new dock also has a built-in fan this time around.
6. The Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage, a mammoth eight times the amount of space the original came with.
7. If you simply have too many games and need even more room, MicroSD Express cards are the only type that can be inserted for extra storage. Frustratingly, original Switch microSDs won‚Äôt work.
8.The Switch 2 will also be using a new type of game card. They‚Äôre red as opposed to their predecessor‚Äôs grey, and have a faster reading speed.
9. The audio capabilities of the Switch 2 appear significantly improved, with better quality speakers allowing for increased range, as well as 3D audio available when using headphones. Great, now we‚Äôll be able to hear that blue shell coming for us directly from behind.
10. There‚Äôs also a built-in microphone on the top of the console that comes into its own when using the Switch 2‚Äôs brand-new GameChat feature (more on that later).
11. It also possesses two USB C ports. One on the bottom, just like the original Switch, and one on top to make charging easier when in tabletop mode, or if you want to take advantage of the new Nintendo Switch Camera 2 accessory.
12. The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera will be available on the same day as the console. It will cost  $49.99/¬£49.99 and can be used to put your face into games, such as Mario Party Jamboree, or as an overlay when playing with friends.
13. The Switch 2 joy-con connects magnetically to the console via the bigger, metallic SL and SR buttons, and also has larger analog sticks.
14.Each joy-con can also be used as a mouse too. Some examples of games that have were shown to use this functionality are Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Civilization 7.
15. A new Pro Controller will also be available for the Switch 2. It comes with programmable GL and GR buttons on the grips and will be available for $79.99/¬£74.99.
16. Other official accessories revealed at this time include Mario Kart steering wheels, a Switch 2 carry case, and an ‚Äúall in one‚Äù carry case that can store and carry all equipment needed to play in TV mode.

17. Amiibo also make their return and are confirmed to be compatible with the Switch 2. Three new Street Fighter Amiibo ‚Äì Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly ‚Äì are due at the console‚Äôs launch.
18.The standard Nintendo Switch 2 console costs $449.99/¬£395.99and comes with the following in its box: A Nintendo Switch 2 console, Joy-Con 2 controllers (L+R), Joy-Con 2 Grip, Joy-Con 2 Straps, Nintendo Switch 2 Dock, Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable, Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter, and a USB-C Charging Cable.
19. A Mario Kart World Bundle will also be available at launch. It comes with all of the above, plus a copy of the game. This will cost $499.99/¬£429.99.
20. And finally, the big mystery of the Switch 2‚Äôs C button was finally solved.GameChat is a new party voice channel systemfor the Nintendo console that will allow players to talk to friends, and all begins with a press of that button.
21. The microphone on the top of the console promises to pick up players‚Äô voices over the top of background noise, whether be busy traffic or a vacuum cleaner on the other side of the room.
22. It will also allow players to share their screens with others, much like PlayStation‚Äôs share screen tech, so that you can see what your friends are up to or even help them with a particular puzzle.
23. GameChat, of course, comes with a price, though. And that admission fee is a Nintendo Online membership. That will only be the case after March 31st, 2026, however, as before then it will be available to all Switch 2 owners for free.
And that‚Äôs all the quickfire information we picked out from Nintendo‚Äôs extensive Switch 2 Direct. Are you planning on picking up a Switch 2 at launch? Let us know in the comments. And for everything else Switch 2, stick with IGN.

"Nintendo Switch 2 Tech Specs: Battery Life, 4K and Up to 120fps, Storage, and More",2025-04-02T18:22:44Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-specs-battery-life-4k-and-up-to-120fps-storage-and-more,"Nintendo just revealed so much about the Nintendo Switch 2 during its latest Direct, but we have learned even more since the hour-long presentation ended, including the new console's tech specs. While we still have a lot of questions, let's break down what's new with the Switch 2.

This had been touched on before, butNintendo reiteratedthat this new system will feature a 7.9-inch wide color gamut LCD screen that is capable of outputting at 1080p (1920x1080). This is a big upgrade from Switch 1's 6.2-inch screen, the Switch OLED's 7-inch screen (although we will miss OLED!), and the Switch Lite's 5.5-inch screen.
There is also support for HDR10 and VRR up to 120 Hz, which means games can jump up to 120fps if they and your setup allow it.
It was also confirmed that slotting the Switch 2 to its new dock will allow games to be played in 4K (3840x2160) at 60fps or 1080p/1440p (1920x1080/2560x1440) at 120fps. We know these higher-end graphics are made possible by a ""custom processor made by NVIDIA,"" but sadly we are currently given no further details in regard to Switch 2's CPU/GPU.
What was revealed, however, was the battery life. The Switch 2's internal battery is a Lithium-ion battery with 5220mAh, and this will allow for approximately 2 - 6.5 hours of battery life and a charge time of three hours when in Sleep mode. Nintendo noted these are ""rough estimates"" and that the ""battery life will depend on the games you play.""
This battery life is just about the same as the launch model Switch 1 as it boasted a range of 2.5 - 6.5 hours. On the other hand, the Switch 2's battery life is a downgrade from the three newer Switch models - Nintendo Switch (4.5 - 9 hours), Nintendo Switch - OLED Model (4.5 - 9 hours), and Nintendo Switch Lite (3 - 7 hours).
Elsewhere, we learn that the Switch is approximately 4.5 inches tall x 10.7 inches wide x .55 inches thick with the Joy-Con 2 attached. This translates to a weight of roughly .88 pounds without Joy-Con 2 and 1.18 lbs with them attached.
The weight of the Switch 2 is an exact match for the current Switch 1 model, but it is both taller and longer than any current model with Joy-Con attached;
Speaking of Joy-Con, we sadly don't get the confirmation that they are using Hall Effect joysticks that would likely preventthe drifting issues many Switch owners experienced.They very well may use them, asit was hinted at in a patent from 2023,but we'll have to wait to find out for sure.
On the audio front, the Switch 2 supports linear PCM output 5.1ch. If you want a surround sound effect, that can also be enabled via headphones of the built-in speaker after a system update.
For storage, the Switch 2 will feature 256 GB of internal storage, which is another upgrade from the 32 GB available on the Switch and Switch Lite and the 64 GB on the Switch - OLED Model. Another big difference here is that the Switch 2 will require microSD Express cards for up to 2TB of extra storage, meaning the microSDXC cards the current Switch models support will not be able to be transferred over to the new console.
To wrap up, it was also revealed the Switch 2 will support Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi 6), it will have 2 USB-C ports, a 3.5mm 4-contact stereo mini-plug (CTIA standard), and a built-in monaural microphone with noice cancellation, echo cancellation, and auto gain control.

Where You Can Buy the Original Nintendo Switch Pro Controller Ahead of the Switch 2 Release,2025-04-02T16:17:54Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/where-you-can-buy-the-original-nintendo-switch-pro-controller,"Nintendo revealed all of thejuicy details about the Switch 2during its April Direct. Theprice of the new consolewasn't too much of a surprise, but the reveal of the cost of first-party Switch 2 games at launch was definitely an eyebrow raiser. Most notably,Mario Kart World is going to cost $80on its own at launch. In addition to that, Nintendo is launching a new line of Switch 2 accessories that have gotten similar price increases compared to the original Switch.

The only Switch 2 accessory I was concerned about was the new Switch 2 Pro controller, which is now priced at a whopping $80. I already have multipleSwitch Pro controllersat home and would prefer not to  have to buy a new version. Thankfully, Nintendo confirmed in its developer interview that the original Switch Pro controllerwill be compatible with Switch 2.
While many folks will choose to opt for the newer Switch 2 Pro controller, it's not going to be necessary for most games. If you already have a Switch Pro controller, you should be fine holding onto that so you can save $80 to spend on new games. If you don't already have a Pro controller and are planning on buying the Switch 2, the standard Switch Pro controller is still a cheaper option right now at $69.99.
It's possible these older controllers could sell out before the Switch 2 arrives to make room for the newer controller. Amazon already has a signifcant lack of stock and is currently only offeringthird-party alternatives. Alongside compatiblity for the regular Switch Pro controller, Nintendo has also stated that the original Joy-Con controlllers will also be compatible ‚Äì though we generallyrecommend the Switch Pro controller over Joy-Confor most games.
If the only accessory you really care about getting your hands on is the new Switch 2 Pro controller, you're going to have to wait until the console launches. The new controller will be officially available alongside the launch of the Switch 2 on June 5. You should be able topreorder the new console starting on April 9, which is likely when the official accessories will also become available for preorder. The Switch 2 Pro controller will only be compatible with the Switch 2, however, so you won't be able to use it on the standard Switch.
Listings for the Switch 2 Pro controller have already started to go live at Walmart and Best Buy, but with no preorder date shown. Walmart also includeslistings for the Switch 2 gamesyou'll be able to preorder soon.

Nintendo Confirms Some Switch 2 Game Cards Will Only Include a Download Key,2025-04-02T21:07:42Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-game-cards-will-only-include-a-download-key,"Nintendo has confirmed that those sleek new Switch 2 game cards won‚Äôt always carry an actual game and will, instead, sometimes simply contain a key for a game download.

The Super Mario Bros. company detailed how it will update its approach to physical game cartridges in acustomer support postpublished shortly after this morning‚Äôs Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. It explains that, when the Switch 2arrives this June, you‚Äôll be able to carry on purchasing physical Switch games just as you‚Äôve done for the last eight years, but there are a few things to keep in mind.
The post in question focuses on game-key cards: physical cards that only contain a key to download your chosen game. That means there‚Äôs no actual game data on the card you insert into your Switch 2, so you‚Äôll need to download it once the card is inserted. Every game-key card case will be appropriately labeled on the lower portion of the front of the box, so if you‚Äôre concerned about what exactly you‚Äôre purchasing, you should have a heads-up right away.
News that Nintendo will utilize these game-key cards for Switch 2 has already taken hold of physical gaming fans who prefer the simplicity of plug-in-play without the need for lengthy download periods and an internet connection to get set up. The concern is that these are little more than fancy key holders that will soon replace all standard cartridges, but there are few reasons to believe this is actually the case for now.
Many have already taken to social media to point out that, while some early looks at Switch 2 box art, including covers for games likeStreet Fighter 6and theBravely Default remaster, do indeed feature that game-key card disclaimer, others, such asMario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananza, do not.
It appears the game-key card approach will likely be reserved for a few especially hefty games that might benefit from the key strategy, such as something like Hogwarts Legacy or Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Even then, developer CD Projekt Red hasalready confirmed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will ship with a game cardthat comes in at a whopping 64 GB on the Switch 2‚Äôs launch day.
Additionally, as explained during the Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo seems pretty proud ofthe new tech its upgraded red game cards support. They‚Äôre said to come with faster data reading speeds than what was seen with the original hybrid console from 2017, a fact the company wouldn‚Äôt need to point out if all of its cartridges were simple key containers. Let's not forget that Nintendo has bent the definition of what a game card offers before, with some notable original Switch examples beingLA NoireandNBA 2K18, which both required additional downloads out of the box.
It‚Äôs far too soon to tell just how many Switch 2 games will rely on game-key cards, but we know all will be revealed as launch draws closer. For now, the Nintendo Switch 2 is primed to click into action come June 5, 2025. For everything revealed during today‚Äôs all-encompassing Direct, clickhere.

Nvidia Says Its Custom GPU Means Nintendo Switch 2 Has 10x the Graphics Performance of the Nintendo Switch,2025-04-03T15:50:29Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-says-its-custom-gpu-means-nintendo-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch,"As Nintendo had teased, Nvidia has now discussed the custom GPU powering the Nintendo Switch 2, although it failed to go into the level of detail tech enthusiasts were hoping for.

In ablog post, Nvidia confirmed what IGN had reported earlier today from Nintendo itself: that its GPU enables AI upscaling via DLSS and ray tracing.
Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is an AI-powered technology that uses machine learning to upscale lower-resolution images in real-time, enhancing both performance and image quality in games.
There is a little more detail on offer here on the Switch 2‚Äôs GPU. Nvidia described it as a ‚Äúcustom Nvidia processor featuring an Nvidia GPU with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements.‚Äù
Nvidia continued: ‚ÄúWith 1,000 engineer-years of effort across every element ‚Äî from system and chip design to a custom GPU, APIs and world-class development tools ‚Äî the Nintendo Switch 2 brings major upgrades.‚Äù
Those upgrades include up to 4K gaming in TV mode and up to 120 FPS at 1080p in handheld mode. Nintendo Switch 2 also supports HDR, and AI upscaling ‚Äúto sharpen visuals and smooth gameplay.‚Äù
The new RT Cores bring real-time ray tracing, delivering ‚Äúlifelike lighting, reflections and shadows for more immersive worlds,‚Äù Nvidia continued.
Tensor Cores, meanwhile, power AI-driven features like DLSS, ‚Äúboosting resolution for sharper details without sacrificing image quality.‚Äù
Interestingly, Nvidia said the Tensor Cores also enable AI-powered face tracking and background removal in video chat use cases, ‚Äúenhancing social gaming and streaming.‚Äù
During the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed the C button, which is used for new chat functionality that incorporates an external camera and the microphone in the Switch 2 itself. Nintendo made a point of saying the tech is smart enough to pay attention to the player‚Äôs voice and filter out background noise.
And here‚Äôs the big claim from Nvidia:
‚ÄúWith 10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2 delivers smoother gameplay and sharper visuals.‚Äù
There‚Äôs no detail on how it‚Äôs determined that graphics performance. It will no doubt be left to experts such asDigital Foundryto run the numbers once the Switch 2 launches in June.
Elsewhere, Nvidia said the Tensor Cores ‚Äúboost AI-powered graphics while keeping power consumption efficient,‚Äù and the RT Cores ‚Äúenhance in-game realism with dynamic lighting and natural reflections.‚Äù
Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) via Nvidia G-SYNC in handheld mode ‚Äúensures ultra-smooth, tear-free gameplay.‚Äù
In a hardware-focused roundtable Q&A in New York yesterday, attended by IGN,Nintendo representatives confirmed the Switch 2 uses DLSS, but did not specify which version of the tech, or whether it had been customized for Switch 2. It was a similarly vague response when Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2‚Äôs GPU is capable of ray tracing.
And what about the GPU itself? Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo‚Äôs Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, chimed in to say Nintendo prefers not to get in the weeds on things like the GPU.
‚ÄúNintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat we really like to focus on is the value that we can provide to our consumers. But I do believe that our partner Nvidia will be sharing some information.‚Äù
In January, the internet spotted a patent, filed July 2023 but published for the first time earlier this year,that described AI image upscaling technologythat would help keep video game download sizes small enough to fit on a physical game cartridge while offering up to 4K textures.

The CRKD Nitro Deck for the Switch Just Dropped to Its Lowest-Ever Price,2025-03-14T20:48:04Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/the-crkd-nitro-deck-for-the-switch-just-dropped-to-its-lowest-ever-price,"One of my main frustrations with playing the Nintendo Switch in handheld mode is how uncomfortable it gets. The Joy-Con controllers that come with the Switch are great in a pinch, but they just weren't built for longer gaming sessions. I love theNintendo Switch Pro controllerfor playing games on my TV, but whenever I play on the go I use the Nitro Deck.

I purchased my CRKD Nitro Deckduring Prime Day last yearwhen it dropped in price, but Amazon has just discounted the price on the white model even further. Right now, you can pick up this great Switch accessory for 24% off its normal price.
Multiple colors of the Nitro Deck are currently on sale, but only the white versionhas dropped to its lowest-ever price. You can purchase the black, gray, blue, and pink versions for just $2 more. There are also various special editions that are quite a bit more expensive that are discounted.
The selling point of the Nitro Deck is comfort. The grips fit my hands wonderfully, and the controller itself includes gyro compatibility and rumble support. There's also a convenient kickstand that lets you set your Switch upright on a flat surface. Unlike some Joy-Con, the joysticks offer zero stick drift. You can also remap the buttons if you want to take customization further.

IGN had the chance to review this controller back in 2023. Here's a quick snippet of what we said in ourhands-on CRKD Nitro Deck review:
""For many, simply having a solution to the Nintendo Switch‚Äôs infamous stick drift is enough to warrant an upgrade to the Nitro Deck, especially when factoring in that the entire unit is less than the cost of a new pair of Joy-Con controllers. However, the upside gained with a more durable shell, customizable back buttons, better ergonomics for handheld play, and a sturdier kickstand makes the Nitro Deck an easy recommendation for hardcore and casual gamers as it makes your Nintendo Switch feel practically like a new console. The added heft and weight certainly take getting used to compared to the stock Nintendo Switch, but the upgraded experience it provides in nearly every way is well worth your time.""
Now that we know the Nintendo Switch 2 is coming out later this year, you may be wondering if this particularSwitch accessorywill be compatible with the new hardware. The answer is no. TheSwitch 2 will be largerthan the standard Switch, so the Nitro Deck will not be compatible with it. You will only be able to use it with the standard Switch model and the Nintendo Switch OLED.

Here's a First Look at the Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes,2025-04-03T10:08:05Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-a-first-look-at-the-nintendo-switch-2-game-boxes,"Here's our first look at Nintendo's newly designedNintendo Switch 2game boxes.

While the OG Nintendo Switch's game covers simply boasted a small Nintendo Switch logo in the top left-hand corner, the Switch 2's branding is far more prominent, with a red band stretching across the entire width of the case and a larger Nintendo Switch 2 logo.
There's also a change for Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives, too. While Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive game covers don't have any further information or branding on them, covers for games playable on both the original and Switch 2 systems all include a clear statement about Switch 2's upgrade information.
For instance, The Nintendo Switch 2 edition ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wildincludes the text: ""Includes the Nintendo Switch game and the Nintendo Switch upgrade pack. Upgrade pack also available separately.""
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games,some of which cost $79.99, clearly mark the boxes as such to let buyers know what they're getting.
You can see the new designs for yourself in the slideshow below:
There's now also a QR code on the bottom right of all game covers that takes you swiftly to the official Nintendo website.
At last, theNintendo Switch 2 has a release date. It's coming on June 5, 2025, with prices starting at $449.99. A bundle is also available withMario Kart Worldincluded for $499.99, although if you want to buy Nintendo's signature racer separately,it's $79.99.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom Are Getting Achievements on Nintendo Switch 2,2025-04-03T16:53:41Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-are-getting-achievements-on-nintendo-switch-2,"Both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are getting Nintendo Switch 2 versions for the new console. Alongside the in-game upgrades, Nintendo's adding a number of additional features through the new Zelda Notes option in its Nintendo Switch App, including achievements.

The Nintendo Switch App (formerly known as the Nintendo Switch Online App) will get an update adding Zelda Notes, a game-specific service exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 versions of both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.
This app wasshown off in the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, allowing players to use GPS-style navigation to reach landmarks in the Zelda games. For achievements, the app will track your play data and allow players to earn in-app medals based on their records. These account for opening chests, earning rupees, and more.
In the Achievements section, Nintendo lists categories such as ""Quests and Adventures Cleared,"" ""Shrines of Light Cleared,"" ""Locations Visited,"" ""Lightroots Unlocked,"" and others. Alongside tracking those numbers, the app will also let you see how you match up with other players on a global scale.
While the achievements seem geared towards completion, it's interesting to see Nintendo experiment with these options. Granted, they exist in a phone app rather than on the Switch 2 console by itself, but I am curious to see whether other games get similar treatments in the future.
Other features of the Zelda Notes app include a Daily Bonus option for helpful resources, a Voice Memories section which adds more story and lore to the world as you explore, and an Autobuild Sharing tool. These do seem like handy tools, and especially geared towards people playing through this Zelda duology for the second time on their Nintendo Switch 2.
The Nintendo Switch 2 has a launch date set for June 5, 2025. Both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom will have Switch 2 editions at launch, alongside a slew of other games both new and refreshed. Previews dropped this morning for some of the launch window games for the Nintendo Switch 2, includingMario Kart World,Donkey Kong Bananza, andgeneral hands-on impressions of the console.

"Nintendo Switch 2: 72 New Game Details - Mario Kart 9, The Duskbloods, and More!",2025-04-02T17:20:15Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-72-new-game-details-mario-kart-9-the-duskbloods-and-more,"Nintendo has finally given usall the info on its new console, the Switch 2. During the hour-long Direct, there was a LOT of info on both new and old games coming toNintendo‚Äôs new console. From expected arrivals such as Mario Kart World to the complete surprise of what looks like a spiritual sequel to Bloodborne, here are 72 new details about the Nintendo Switch 2 games library as we know it right now.

1. The Switch 2‚Äôs flagship launch title looks set to be Mario Kart World, the first open-world Mario Kart game that will allow you to ‚Äúdrive almost anywhere‚Äù.
2. Many new tracks were seen in the trailer, including one based on the original Donkey Kong game and a metropolis that could be Super Mario Odyssey‚Äôs New Donk City.
3. The overworld‚Äôs roads and track conditions will change due to the environment‚Äôs changing weather and a day/night cycle.
4. Up to 24 drivers in a race were confirmed, almost certainly leading to even more Mario Kart havoc.
5. A new mode for Mario Kart World called Knockout Tour will be introduced. These will be longer races where you follow the checkpoints and have to remain near the leaders to avoid elimination and ultimately take the crown.
6. You can also drive freely around the open world and meet up with friends. A photo mode will help document these adventures.
7. New racing mechanics look set to be introduced. We see wall-riding and grinding in the trailer, as well as what looks like Birdo transforming into a semi-truck and Mario eating a burger to transform into a different version of himself? I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll find out what the hell is going on here soon enough.
8. And that time could be 6am Pacific Time on the 17th of April, when Mario Kart World will be having its very own Nintendo Direct stream.
9. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be getting its very own Switch 2 version, which allows you to take advantage of the new joy-con mouse controls.
10. Metroid Prime 4 will also be available to play in two different graphics modes. Quality Mode allows for  4K 60FPS with HDR enabled when docked and 1080p 60fps handheld. Performance Mode offers 1080p with HDR at 120fps docked, but 720p 120fps HDR when handheld.
11. A new 3D Donkey Kong platformer called Donkey Kong Bananza is heading to the Switch 2 on July 17th. It appears we‚Äôll be able to smash everything in it.
12. Kirby Air Riders, a follow-up to GameCube racing spin-off Kirby Air Ride, is also coming to the Switch 2. It will be directed by legendary Super Smash Bros. developer, and Kirby creator, Masahiro Sakurai.
13. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour will offer a ‚Äúvirtual exhibition‚Äù of the new hardware, as well as being filled with minigames. This will not be packed into each Switch 2 at launch, though, but a paid-for game in its own right.
14. Drag X Drive is a launch game that uses the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con mouse controls to enable three-on-three basketball-style matches.
15. Then there are a bunch of existing Nintendo-published games that will be getting Switch 2 upgrades. These won‚Äôt be free for existing owners, however, with paid upgrade packs being the barrier to entry. The list of Switch 1 games getting these upgrades so far includes:
16. Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV, the latter being an expansion centered around the Switch 2 camera and GameChat additions.
17. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, with both receiving enhanced resolution and frame rates, as well as HDR implementation. A new Zelda Notes section on the Nintendo Today app will also be added to let you look at Hyrule‚Äôs map and easily share TOTK creations with other players.
18. Kirby and the Forgotten Land will be receiving an upgrade, as well as a new Star Cross World story expansion.
19. And Pokemon Legends Z-A will get its very own Switch 2 version with enhanced resolution when it arrives later in 2025.
20. But that‚Äôs not it. During the Switch 2 direct a whole host of third-party games, both new and old, were revealed to be making their way to Nintendo‚Äôs upcoming console. We‚Äôve got them all for you here:
21. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the whole direct, FromSoftware is making what looks like a spiritual successor to Bloodborne exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2. Releasing in 2026, The Duskbloods is officially described as ‚Äúa brand-new multiplayer game"" from the Dark Souls developers and we look forward to hearing much more about it when a Creator‚Äôs Voice article from Hidetaka Miyazaki himself drops on the Nintendo Today App on April 4th.
22. FromSoft‚Äôs last game, Elden Ring, will also be making its way to Switch 2 with its Tarnished Edition.
23. Hades 2 will arrive (presumably once out of early access)
24. We finally got another little peek at Hollow Knight Silksong, which is listed for 2025.
25. Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition will be available on day one.
26. Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion will launch on September 5th.

29. Hogwarts Legacy, complete with mouse controls, will be available at launch.

32. James Bond will make his way to Switch 2 when Project 007 is released by IO Interactive.
33. A Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster will launch alongside the Switch 2.

36. Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4 are also set for launch day.
37. And Borderlands 4 will fire its way onto Switch 2 alongside its thousands of different ridiculous pieces of weaponry.
38. Civilization 7 will be taking advantage of the Switch 2‚Äôs mouse controls at launch.
39. And both WWE 2K and NBA 2K will both be making their way to the console as well.
40. Survival Kids, a colourful co-op survival game, will be arriving at launch, too.
41. Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition is on the way from CD Projekt Red, complete with its Phantom Liberty expansion.
42. And Square Enix will also be bringing Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade to Switch 2 in all its glory.
43. There were also MANY more games shown to be on their way to the Switch 2. Let‚Äôs rattle them off here, starting with Enter the Gungeon 2.

67. There will be three titles at launch, including The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. Yeah, it‚Äôs not the HD remaster that many have been crying out for but at least it‚Äôs a way of replaying the fantastic GameCube adventure on the go.
68. SoulCalibur 2 is also a launch game, along with F-Zero GX. What‚Äôs more, multiplayer games like F-Zero GX will support four-player local and online play.
69. Games coming further down the line include Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, Super Mario Strikers, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Chi bi-Robo!, Luigi‚Äôs Mansion, and Pokemon Coliseum.

71. All GameCube games benefit from superior image quality and improved resolution compared to the original versions.
72. Additionally, a dedicated Switch 2 GameCube controller is coming, available exclusively to Nintendo Switch Online members. It‚Äôll connect wireless to Switch 2 and also has a C button for GameChat.

Quite the list! Looks like we'll be doing a lot of racing (and throwing food around?) when Mario Kart World launches alongside the Nintendo Switch 2. Although impressions are positive around the look and open-world ambitions the game,questions have been raised around its $80 price tag.

"Nintendo Switch 2 Game Sizes Revealed, and It Looks Like the 256 GB Internal Storage Will Keep Most Players Going for a While",2025-04-04T11:06:14Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-sizes-revealed-and-it-looks-like-the-256-gb-internal-storage-will-keep-most-players-going-for-a-while,"Nintendo has confirmed some of its Switch 2 game sizes, and, thankfully, they‚Äôre relatively small.

The Japanese My Nintendo Store lists a number of Switch 2 games alongside their file sizes.
The Nintendo Switch 2 features 256 GB of internal storage, which is a significant upgrade on the 32 GB available on the OG Switch and Switch Lite and the 64 GB on the Switch - OLED Model.
Another big difference is that the Switch 2 requires microSD Express cards for up to 2 TB of extra storage, meaning the microSDXC cards the current Switch models support cannot transfer over to the new console.
But, based on the file sizes revealed on the Japanese store, that 256 GB of internal storage should keep most players going for a while.
The biggest file size here is, as you‚Äôd expect, Mario Kart World, but at 23.4 GB it only takes up around 10% of the Switch 2‚Äôs total internal storage.
Mario Kart World is relatively slim compared tothe beefy Cyberpunk 2077, which weighs in at 64 GB on Nintendo Switch 2. That's a chunky 25% of the Switch 2‚Äôs internal storage.
Nintendo also recently confirmed that several newSwitch 2 game cards won‚Äôt always carry an actual game, but instead contain a key for a game download. This isn't the case for Cyberpunk 2077, though.
For context, one of the biggest games on the original Switch, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was just 16 GB.
It‚Äôs worth noting that the GameCube app‚Äôs size is expected to grow as new games are added to the library. At launch, the GameCube app contains The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and SoulCalibur 2.
So, how is the Nintendo Switch 2 able to get away with relatively small game sizes while offering up to 4K resolution?
In January, the internet spotted a Nintendo patent, filed July 2023 but published for the first time earlier this year,that described AI image upscaling technologythat would help keep video game download sizes small enough to fit on a physical game cartridge while offering up to 4K textures. It was thought at the time that this applied to the Nintendo Switch 2, and could relate to Nvidia DLSS graphics technology.
Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is an AI-powered technology that uses machine learning to upscale lower-resolution images in real-time, enhancing both performance and image quality in games.
This week, in the wake of the Nintendo Direct,Nintendo and Nvidia confirmed the Switch 2‚Äôs custom GPU enables AI upscaling via DLSS and ray tracing.
Nvidia described it as a ‚Äúcustom Nvidia processor featuring an Nvidia GPU with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements.‚Äù
Those upgrades include up to 4K gaming in TV mode and up to 120 FPS at 1080p in handheld mode. Nintendo Switch 2 also supports HDR, and AI upscaling ‚Äúto sharpen visuals and smooth gameplay.‚Äù
The new RT Cores bring real-time ray tracing, delivering ‚Äúlifelike lighting, reflections and shadows for more immersive worlds,‚Äù Nvidia continued.
Tensor Cores, meanwhile, power AI-driven features like DLSS, ‚Äúboosting resolution for sharper details without sacrificing image quality.‚Äù
Details are thin on the ground, however. In a hardware-focused roundtable Q&A in New York this week, attended by IGN,Nintendo representatives confirmed the Switch 2 uses DLSS, but did not specify which version of the tech, or whether it had been customized for Switch 2. It was a similarly vague response when Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2‚Äôs GPU is capable of ray tracing.
And what about the GPU itself? Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo‚Äôs Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, chimed in to say Nintendo prefers not to get in the weeds on things like the GPU.
‚ÄúNintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat we really like to focus on is the value that we can provide to our consumers. But I do believe that our partner Nvidia will be sharing some information.‚Äù

Here's How to Score 35% Off NSO Expansion Pack Memberships Ready for Switch 2 (UK),2025-04-03T14:31:19Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-memberships-best-deal-uk,"GameCube games coming exclusively to the Switch 2'sexclusive online library is one of the best features of the new console. To make those membership costs just that little bit easier, UK retailerShopTohas NSO at 35% off right now, and there's an extra 5% when you use code SPRING at checkout. As you get yourNintendo Switch 2 preordersin, this is an absolute bonus bargain to consider.

While some Nintendo Classics catalogues are unlocked with the base online subscription, you'll also need the Expansion Pack to play GameCube titles on Nintendo Switch 2. What's more, while you can subscribe to a monthly model for just Nintendo Switch Online, the Expansion Pack is only available on the 12-month plan, so make a note when purchasing.
Currently, the individual versions of these combined 12-month subscriptions cost either ¬£34.99 on the Nintendo eShop or ¬£39.99 at retailers like ShopTo. But now, it seems like ShopTo are keen to get on the Switch 2 hype by slashing ¬£14.14 off the individual plan and ¬£15.14 off the family plans respectively.
So, if you're the only Nintendo Switch players in your household, you can buy theindividual Online + Expansion Pack plan for ¬£24.55or theFamily Membership for ¬£43.55with the promo code SPRING.
Overall, the family version is fantastic value as you can have up to eight Nintendo Accounts under a Family Group sharing the same membership, and you don't have to be in the same household either.
Under ShopTo's new price, that's as low as ¬£5.60 per person getting to enjoy Nintendo Switch Online and the entire Expansion Pack's catalogue of games‚Äîincluding GameCube gemsPokemon XD: Gale of Darkness,Soulcalibur 2, andThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker‚Äî for a whole year.
If you're like me, though, and have already have a basic Nintendo Switch Online membership active until next year, the only way to upgrade is through Nintendo themselves‚Äîeither on their website or the eShop‚Äîwithout a direct discount from retailers like ShopTo.
However, a way to get around that is by purchasingdiscounted digital Nintendo eShop gift cards from Currys. Buy entering the code ""NINTENDODIGITAL10"" at checkout, you'll get 10% off on¬£15,¬£25,¬£50,¬£75, and¬£100amounts of eShop credit‚Äîsaving you as much as ¬£10.
In the case of upgrading your 12-month Nintendo Switch Online membership, the cost of which varies depending on how much is left, you can buy the closest amount you need or a larger amount at a bigger discount, and use any extra credit you have on digital games or save it to put toward your subscription next year.

Nintendo Switch 2 Tech Analysis: Is 4K Actually Realistic?,2025-04-04T18:47:02Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-analysis-is-4k-actually-realistic,"TheNintendo Switch 2has finally been revealed, and while it brings huge improvements over the original console, it doesn‚Äôt exist in the same vacuum that the original handheld did. With the introduction of devices like theSteam DeckandAsus ROG Ally X, a ton of handheld gaming systems out there can play AAA PC games on the go.

So, while the Switch 2 will automatically have a niche carved out for being a system that plays, well, Nintendo games likeMario Kart World,anyone that‚Äôs buying a Switch 2 to play multiplatform games will have to reckon with devices like the Steam Deck ‚Äì especially with the Switch 2‚Äôs $449 price tag.
Now that Nintendo has given a sneak peek into the hardware that‚Äôs running its new console, we can take a look at how exactly it will run, and whether or not its 4K promises are more than empty words.
The SoC (System on a Chip) that runs the Nintendo Switch 2 is probably the most important part of the console, but it‚Äôs the thing we know the least about. We do know that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúcustom Nvidia processor‚Äù thatsupports DLSS and ray tracing, but beyond that, neither Nintendo nor Nvidia have revealed any specifics. Luckily, there are a ton of leaks that suggest the Nintendo Switch 2 is using the aging Ampere graphics architecture behind theRTX 3080.
Going all the way back to 2023, there wereleaks suggesting that the Nintendo Switch 2 would be using the Nvidia Tegra T239 SoC. This APU uses 8 ARM A78C cores, combined with an Nvidia Ampere GPU with 1,536 CUDA cores. Napkin math puts that at 12 Streaming Multiprocessors, which would be significantly smaller than even the smallest Ampere GPU ‚Äì the RTX 3050 for laptops. However, assuming Nvidia didn‚Äôt nerf the Ampere SMs in the T239, each SM would have four Tensor Cores and an RT core, making for a total of 48 and 12, respectively.
To be fair, the Steam Deck is using a custom AMD APU that‚Äôs built on 8 AMD RDNA 2 GPU cores, which is smaller than what Nintendo is offering here. But, you have to keep in mind that the Steam Deck has a lower resolution display, and pumps more power into it. Plus,AMD Z2 processorsare coming out over the next year, with the Z2 Extreme featuring 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, which will be a huge upgrade. Though, systems with that chipset are going to bemuchmore expensive than the Switch 2.
That small of a GPU basically makes 4K gaming an impossibility natively, but because the Tensor Cores are there, DLSS is going to be a major factor in how the Nintendo Switch performs when docked ‚Äì assuming this is the SoC that‚Äôs actually in the system. However, with so few Tensor Cores, even upscaling to 4K is going to be a stretch in everything but the most lightweight games.
Instead, most games are likely going to target 1080p, even if they don‚Äôt natively render at that resolution. There are games like Donkey Kong Bananza that do seem to be rendering at a native 1080p resolution, according toDigital Foundry‚Äôs hands-on demos. However, third-party games like Cyberpunk 2077 seem to be relying heavily on upscaling, with native resolutions as low as 540p. I wouldn‚Äôt expect the Nintendo Switch 2 to ever be able to handle Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K, even with DLSS, though Nintendo will definitely have better luck with any game it can get running natively at 1080p.
The Ampere cores in the rumored T239 also have RT cores, which should theoretically allow for ray tracing in Nintendo Switch 2 games. Though, again, this will be heavily constrained by the processor‚Äôs 12 RT cores. Ray tracing will be possible, but don‚Äôt expect any jaw-dropping implementations of the technology, and especially don‚Äôt expect it in games likeCyberpunk 2077.
Even with RT cores, ray tracing is an extremely expensive workload for the GPU, and the T239 is limited by more than just its small SM count ‚Äì power is a huge limiting factor, too. I spoke withRichard Leadbetter over at Digital Foundry, who told me that the entire system likely consumes as little as 10W, including the display, the SoC, and the mainboard. We won‚Äôt know exactly what the T239‚Äôs actual TDP (thermal design power) is until someone finds a way to measure it, but it likely leaves only 5-6W for the SoC itself ‚Äì a third of the power of the Steam Deck‚Äôs AMD APU.
However, while the Nintendo Switch 2 might not be able to produce the same amount of power as ahandheld gaming PClike the Asus ROG Ally X, that doesn‚Äôt mean there won‚Äôt be gorgeous games running on the system. After all, games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza look stunning, and it goes to show how clever Nintendo developers are at getting the most out of the hardware in the Switch.
After all, the original Nintendo Switch was powered by the Nvidia Tegra X1, which was built on thenow-ancient Maxwell graphics architectureand only packed 256 CUDA cores. Ampere is orders of magnitude more efficient than Maxwell even on its best days, and there are six times more cores in the Switch 2‚Äôs GPU. The Nintendo Switch 2 should bewayfaster than the original console, which bodes well for cross-generation ports like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
While a total system power budget of 10W means the system isn‚Äôt quite as fast as it could be, it does mean the battery will have a much better time keeping up. Nintendo has come out and said it should last around 2 hours at a minimum. That‚Äôs less than was quoted for the original Switch, but that shouldn‚Äôt be too surprising, due to its higher-resolution display and more powerful processor.
The Nintendo Switch 2 has a 5,220mAh battery, a large step up from the 4,310mAh battery in the original console. That‚Äôs a sizable jump, and if its battery has the same voltage of the original Switch, that would equate to around 19Whr. That‚Äôs a smaller battery than theSteam Deck, which is probably why Nintendo quotes a similar battery life to the Steam Deck, despite its less power-hungry processor.
Nintendo probably could have put a more powerful battery in the Switch 2, but its decision likely came down to size constraints. There‚Äôs only so much battery that‚Äôll fit while retaining the same thickness as the original Nintendo Switch, after all.
The most striking difference at first glancebetween the Switch and Switch 2is probably going to be the display. While it doesn‚Äôt have the OLED screen that made theSwitch OLEDsuch a marvel, the display is bigger and has a higher resolution. The Nintendo Switch 2 sports a 7.9-inch LCD display with a resolution of 1920x1080 with HDR 10 support. The display is also fast, supporting variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. That‚Äôs honestly a bit overkill considering the silicon powering the thing, but it does mean that older games or indie titles will feel extremely smooth ‚Äì assuming they have unlocked frame rates. 120Hz is also a useful refresh rate for games that target 40fps since that makes for a clean ratio that won‚Äôt result in excessive stuttering.
Nintendo hasn‚Äôt released any information about the brightness of the display, but the HDR 10 certification means it needs toat leasthave a peak brightness of 1,000 nits, so it‚Äôs going to be a bright screen. We don‚Äôt know exactly how color performance will turn out either, but Nintendo does claim that it supports WCG, or Wide Color Gamut.
The display is probably going to be the thing that lifts the Nintendo Switch 2 above its competitors. The Steam Deck LCD has an 800p display with a peak brightness of 400 nits, and it doesn‚Äôt support WCG. The Steam Deck OLED does offer a much nicer display, but it‚Äôs still an 800p display. The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is also a huge upgrade over the original, which had a 6.2-inch, 720p LCD display.
In a vacuum, the Nintendo Switch 2 is massively better than the original Nintendo Switch. It‚Äôs leagues faster, has a screen that‚Äôs bigger, brighter and sharper, and has Joy-Con that you don‚Äôt have to wrestle with to disconnect. The only problem is that the Switch doesn‚Äôt exist in a vacuum anymore.
There are a ton of handheld gaming systems out there now, and while most of them are more expensive than the $449 Nintendo Switch 2, they likely offer a better gameplay experience in multi-platform games. The real appeal of the Switch 2 is going to be Nintendo‚Äôs catalog of first-party games, just like with the original console. Nintendo is known for making great games that make the most of its ‚Äì relatively ‚Äì weak hardware. If you‚Äôre the type of gamer that falls in love with Nintendo games, then the Nintendo Switch 2 makes a lot of sense. However, if you‚Äôre just going to get this thing to play Cyberpunk or Elden Ring on the train, there arebetter gaming handheld optionsout there.

"Nintendo Switch 2 Preorders Are Open at Argos, Invite System in Place at Amazon UK",2025-04-03T10:55:02Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-uk,"Amazon UK opened preorders to everyonelooking to preorder the Switch 2 today, dropping its previous invite-only system, but it is now out of stock. Argos is also back with a fresh round ofSwitch 2 preorders back in stock today, including not just the console, but games and accessories too.

If you missed out last time, now‚Äôs your chance to lock one in without the faff. But, note that the Switch 2Mario Kart World bundleis currently out of stock at Argos. For the latest updates on new drops, bundles, and restocks, be sure to follow@IGNUKDealson Twitter/X orBluesky.
Meanwhile, Nintendo's official UK preorders also began today, with retailers like EE, GAME, and Smyths experiencing rapid sell-outs. Unfortunately, this has already led to scalpers appearing on eBay with inflated prices. Currently, Amazon and Argos seem to be the most reliable options for securing a Switch 2 in the UK.
For future reference, as it's a common FAQ, Amazon won't charge you until your console ships, making it a low-risk way to guarantee your purchase. While some users initially saw aJune 7th delivery estimate when preordering last week, Amazon support has clarified this is an error, and the current plan remains for launch day delivery on June 5th. Argos, on the other hand, will charge you for your purchase immediately. Stay tuned for more updates.
Here's what Logan Plant had to say inIGN's Nintendo Switch 2 preview: ""Switch 2 is a more premium product and the price tag reflects that. It‚Äôs also a better version of a great thing, and it‚Äôs trying to pull off a bunch of cool new tricks at the same time, like mouse controls. Obviously we‚Äôre both buying Switch 2 on day one, and I did really love our hands-on time with the console. But I‚Äôll be honest and say I have some concerns about if the general public is willing to adopt a $450 Nintendo console with an $80 Mario Kart.""
""It‚Äôs a big ask for a company that traditionally targets families and younger players, and I feel like the high cost of entry limits the Switch 2‚Äôs potential to take off in the way its predecessor did. But for those of you that do decide to take the plunge, you‚Äôll be getting what‚Äôs shaping up to be a great hybrid console that makes a ton of worthwhile improvements on the original Switch and adds some fun bells and whistles for good measure.""
GameCube games coming exclusively to the Switch 2'sexclusive online library is one of the best features of the new console. To make those membership costs just that little bit easier,UK retailer ShopTo has NSO at 35% off right now, and there's an extra 5% when you use code SPRING at checkout. As you get yourNintendo Switch 2 preordersin, this is an absolute bonus bargain to consider.
While some Nintendo Classics catalogues are unlocked with the base online subscription, you'll also need the Expansion Pack to play GameCube titles on Nintendo Switch 2. What's more, while you can subscribe to a monthly model for just Nintendo Switch Online, the Expansion Pack is only available on the 12-month plan, so make a note when purchasing. So, if you're the only Nintendo Switch players in your household, you can buy theindividual Online + Expansion Pack plan for ¬£24.55or theFamily Membership for ¬£43.55with the promo code SPRING.
In a surprise move,Nintendo has delayed the start of Switch 2 preorders in the United States, just days before they were set to go live. The decision comes in response to ongoing tariff concerns and what the company described as ""evolving market conditions""‚Äîa direct reference to the revived threat of Trump-era import duties on electronics.
Preorders were originally scheduled to begin on April 9 in the US, but Nintendo has now put them on hold indefinitely. While no new date has been provided, the company has reassured fans that theSwitch 2‚Äôs global release date‚ÄîJune 5, 2025‚Äîremains unchanged.
The official statement Nintendo shared with IGN: ""Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.‚Äù
For now, the preorder freeze applies exclusively to the US market. UK preorders remain on track, with no changes to pricing or availability. In fact, retailers like Amazon UK are actively sending out preorder invitations, all the while launch-day stock is already starting to dry up across major outlets.
Nintendo had announced that theSwitch 2 is priced at $449.99 USD, while theMario Kart World bundle‚Äîwhich includes the full game‚Äîis set at$499.99 USD.Mario Kart World will also be sold separately for$79.99 USD.
If you're not keen on paying upfront,Amazon still remains your best optionin the UK. When available to buy retailers like Argos require immediate payment, but Amazon won‚Äôt charge a penny until dispatch‚Äîmaking it a safer bet if you're budgeting ahead of June. How the invites work merely seems to be a ballot system where invitees are selected at random.
For preorders at theNintendo Store, where access is limited to long-timeNintendo Switch Online subscribers with high playtimes and shared usage data, Amazon‚Äôs invite system is far more accessible. It appears to operate on a simple ballot, meaning anyone has a fair shot‚Äîregardless of play history or membership status. Currys and Smyths are also expected to offer more preorder opportunities later through email alerts and queue systems, similar to their successful PS5 launch approach.
With Currys and Smyths, it looks like it will simply be a case of sending out an email when preorders are opened, followed by a queued ordering system. This was the method Currys used when taking PS5 preorders, and it worked without any site crashes at least. This means you could be in for a longer wait from these alternative retailers, but it's a lot less frustrating if you're certain you don't meet the strict requirements to order from Nintendo directly.

Industry Analysts React to Nintendo Switch 2 Pre-order Chaos Due to Tariffs: ‚ÄòWe Are Living in Unhinged Times‚Äô,2025-04-04T19:46:41Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/industry-analysts-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-chaos-due-to-tariffs-we-are-living-in-unhinged-times,"It‚Äôs been a wild news roller coaster for U.S. gamers this week. It began with the celebratory full reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 in all its glory and games, followed closely by audience dismay over its $450 price tag and $80 for Mario Kart World, only for everyone to reel once again this morning as Nintendo announced it would hold off on pre-orders for the system until it could assess the impact of the Trump Administration‚Äôs sudden, sweeping, unprecedented tariffs on just about every nation in the world.

We‚Äôve written elsewhere aboutwhy the Nintendo Switch 2 cost so much to begin with, and what impactthe industry‚Äôs trade association thinks these new tariffs are likely to have on games writ large. But right now, the real question on everyone‚Äôs minds is, what‚Äôs Nintendo going to do? When pre-orders do open, will the Nintendo Switch 2 be even more expensive?
Normally, when there are questions to the tune of ‚Äúwhat is going to happen with video games?‚Äù, I go ask a panel of expert industry analysts. While they can‚Äôt literally predict the future, most of the time, they have a pretty solid consensus understanding, backed by evidence and data, of what‚Äôs most likely to happen, and I turn around and write about that. I‚Äôve already done it twice this week.
But for the first time since I started interviewing analysts on such topics, every single analyst I spoke to was effectively stumped. Several had guesses one way or another: Nintendo will raise the price, or won‚Äôt. But every single one of them heavily caveated their response with an emphasis on the chaos of the moment. This has never happened before, it‚Äôs all happening very fast, and absolutely no one can accurately predict what Nintendo, Trump, or anyone will do tomorrow, next week, or months down the road.
So with that rather astonishing disclaimer in mind, here‚Äôs what all the analysts I spoke todidsay:
With everyone I spoke to taking their best wild guesses on what was going to happen, I ended up with a pretty divided panel. On the side of ‚ÄúNintendo will raise prices‚Äù was Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games. Though he says he at first thought it was too late for Nintendo to raise prices after it had announced them, this delay has changed his mind. At this stage, he doesn‚Äôt think Nintendo has much of a choice.
‚ÄúIt is very difficult to predict, but Nintendo will likely take a few days to run simulations and then announce hikes, not only for the system itself but also games and accessories,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI hope I am wrong but if sustained, these sky-high tariffs leave them no choice. Would you be surprised now to see Switch 2 hit US$500 for the base model? I wouldn't.
‚ÄúWhat I also want to add is this: Why on earth did Nintendo not wait for the US to fix their tariffs first and then decide on pricing during a Direct a few days later? This made no sense.‚Äù
Mat Piscatella, senior analyst at Circana, heavily caveated his opinion (as did basically everyone else) with a reminder that this is all unprecedented and unpredictable. But ultimately, he too came down on the side of games prices generally, including Nintendo prices, likely going up. But how much, and on what is anyone‚Äôs guess. ‚ÄúBased on the conversations I'm having, the breadth and depth of the tariffs surprised everyone, not just consumers,‚Äù he said.
Piscatella told me that Nintendo likely had some assumptions in mind about what the tariffs would be when it set the price originally. But when the actual tariffs came in on Wednesday, it was probably much higher than Nintendo, or anyone, anticipated.
‚ÄúEvery reasonable and responsible business that relies on international supply chains will be reevaluating its US consumer pricing at this point. They have to.
‚ÄúSome territories and regions globally have historically been subject to higher pricing than other parts of the world when it comes to video games. The US could certainly be joining that group because of these tariffs. The haphazard and chaotic nature of the tariffs and their announcement obviously has many scrambling to navigate the fallout.‚Äù
Manu Rosier, director of market analysis at Newzoo, also predicts that hardware prices will increase, though he suggests software will likely not be impacted in the same way.
‚ÄúWhile physical versions might be subject to tariffs, the growing dominance and lower cost of digital distribution would likely limit any broader effect,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúRegarding hardware, however, the situation is more sensitive. If a 20% tariff‚Äîor any substantial increase‚Äîwere to be introduced, it‚Äôs unlikely that companies like Nintendo would absorb the additional cost by cutting into their margins. In such cases, the burden could shift to consumers in the form of higher retail prices.‚Äù
On the other side of speculation, again with a heavy dose of telling me how unprecedented this is and how no one really knows what will happen, I find Joost van Dreunen, NYU Stern professor and author ofSuperJoost Playlist. He acknowledges that a price increase on the Nintendo Switch 2 is possible, especially given the high tariffs on Vietnam. But he thinks the company will try very, very hard to avoid that.
""I believe the volatility from the Trump tariffs was already considered in the Switch 2's $449.99 pricing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGiven the first Trump administration's impact, Nintendo, like other manufacturers, has since restructured its supply chain to mitigate such geopolitical risks. Historically, Nintendo has aimed for a launch price around the $400 mark, adjusted for inflation, suggesting that the current price already reflects an anticipation of potential economic challenges stemming from ongoing trade disputes.
‚ÄúNevertheless, the unpredictable nature of these tariff decisions‚Äîexemplified by the recent situation in Vietnam‚Äîinjects a significant amount of uncertainty into the market. This could compel Nintendo to find ways to absorb or offset additional costs, especially when initial product margins are typically narrower. While I expect Nintendo will strive to maintain the $449.99 price point, the external economic pressures may eventually force a reassessment if the trade landscape deteriorates further.""
Piers Harding-Rolls, games researcher at Ampere Analysis, agrees, saying that Nintendo runs the risk of consumer backlash if it raises prices further:
‚ÄúThe extent of the tariffs and its impact on Vietnamese exports are really bad news for Nintendo,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe company is now in between a rock and a hard place, having already announced the launch price. I have already suggested that the pricing would stay as announced until 2026 at the earliest but then might be adjusted if the tariffs stay in place. This delay in pre-orders is to give the company more time and it will be hoping some sort of solution will be found over the next few weeks. This is a pretty fluid situation after all. Nintendo will not want to change the price having announced it, but I think everything is on the table now. If the pricing does change, it will impact the brand and the US consumer‚Äôs view of the product at launch. I don‚Äôt think that will put off loyal fans, but it might put off broader consumers who will take a wait a see approach. That‚Äôs particularly important during its first holiday season.‚Äù
Finally, I spoke to Rhys Elliott, games analyst at Alinea Analytics. Elliott joined the first camp of analysts in predicting higher prices on both Nintendo hardware and software due to Trump‚Äôs tariffs. He also pointed back to hiscomments in my previous analyst piece, where he spoke on Nintendo announcing cheaper digital editions of Nintendo Switch 2 games in certain markets. ‚ÄúIt seems the lower prices in other markets were to nudge Switch 2 buyers to digital, as I mentioned my comments to IGN about Mario Kart World‚Äôs pricing. Nintendo might have wanted to do something similar in the US, but the tariff situation is so chaotic that Nintendo was in ‚Äòwait and see‚Äô mode ‚Äî and decided to hedge its bets to see if it needed to offset the tariffs.‚Äù
Elliott went on to project a rather grim picture of what will happen to the games industry more broadly as a result of the tariffs, with his predictions in line with whata spokesperson from the Entertainment Software Association warned me of earlier this morningon the same topic. He says that the tariffs will result in a ‚Äúweaker, poorer nation‚Äù, with consumers ultimately paying the price. Here‚Äôs the rest of Elliott‚Äôs take on this:
‚ÄúSome manufacturers ‚Äì Nintendo included ‚Äì have been shifting their manufacturing to non-tariff-impacted markets,‚Äù Elliott says. ‚ÄúAnd even if companies can afford to switch up (no pun intended!) their supply chains, who knows which markets will get tariffs next ‚Äì as recent news supports. Companies cannot just lift up their whole supply chain and move everything to the US. It‚Äôs just not logistically possible. Under current law (I can‚Äôt believe I have to qualify this, but here we are), Trump would not be in power anymore by the time such a move would be completed ‚Äì for Nintendo and other manufacturers. We are living in ‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no other word for it .. unhinged times driven by an unhinged man (and other forces).
‚ÄúThese extreme tariffs will also be bad for consumers in the US but are positive for the US administration‚Äôs populist fa√ßade. Policies that lead to higher prices for everyday people amid a cost-of-living crisis are deplorable. They're bad for gamers and the games business. I won‚Äôt comment on the real reason for the US tariffs, but ‚Äòa much stronger, much richer nation‚Äô is not it.
What‚Äôs more, time and time again, data has shown that tariffs harm the economy. Comparative advantage is a core principle of international trade theory. Basically, consumption and economic well-being are stronger when countries focus on producing goods they can efficiently produce (at the lowest cost compared to other goods) ‚Äì  and trade for goods they are less efficient at producing. The trade war flies in the face of these core economic principles.‚Äù

This $12 Power Bank Can Fast Charge Your Nintendo Switch or Apple iPhone 16,2025-03-20T19:40:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/this-12-power-bank-can-fast-charge-your-nintendo-switch-or-apple-iphone-16,"If you're looking for an affordable power bank that will fast charge your Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or Apple iPhone 16, then check out today's deal. Amazon has theIniu 10,000mAh Power Bankwith up to 45W of Power Delivery over USB Type-C for only $11.25 after you redeem the 50% off coupon on the product page. Iniu power banks have solid reviews and are less expensive than equivalent Anker models.

This Iniu power bank holds a 10,000mAh, or 37Whr battery capacity. If you factor in 80% power efficiency, here are the approximate number of times you can fully recharge each gaming handheld:
The Iniu power bank has three output ports: one built-in 45W USB Type-C cable, one 45W USB Type-C port, and one USB Type-A port. The 45W of Power Delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch (18W) and Steam Deck (40W) at their fastest rate. This power bank is also a solid choice for charging your Apple iPhone 16, sinceChargerLAB has shown that the maximum charging rate caps at about 30W, even for the Pro Max model.
We don't yet know what the maximum charging rate for theNintendo Switch 2will be, but we are hoping that it will be greater than the 18W maximum of the original Switch.We do know that the battery capacity is higher(5,220mAh vs 4,310mAh), so it's only natural to assume that the charging rate will also be higher to maintain the same recharging time. The Nintendo Switch 2's 5,200mAh capacity should translate to about 20Whr, which means this power bank will be able to charge it about 1.5 times.
The built-in cable is a popular feature on newer and generally pricier power banks because you no longer have to bring along your own USB Type-C cable. When you're on the go, the USB plug can be clipped onto the power bank to form a handy little lanyard. The cable itself is quite sturdy with a respectable break strength of 44 pounds and the lanyard loop when clipped to the power bank itself has a break strength of 13 pounds.

The Last of Us Showrunner Wants Nick Offerman to Voice Wario in the Super Mario Bros. Movie Sequel,2025-03-26T16:03:01Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-showrunner-wants-nick-offerman-to-voice-wario-in-the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel,"A sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie is more than a year away, but there's already a name being floated for Wario: The Last of Us Season 1 star and Ron Swanson himself, Nick Offerman.

Speaking to IGN on the red carpet ahead of The Last of Us Season 2 premeire, showrunner Craig Mazin floated Offerman's name as a potential Mario antagonist.
HBO's The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin thinks Wario is misunderstood ‚Äì and that Nick Offerman should voice Wario in the next Mario moviepic.twitter.com/Idui04BOtB
""Nick Offerman would actually do a really good job I think,"" Mazin said. ""Just to bring some gravitas. Because I love Wario and I think he's misunderstood.""
Mazin previously said that Wario was his favorite character in Mario Kart. ""I want people to understand Wario is the way he is for reasons,"" Mazin continued. ""He's Wario! He's-a gonna win!""
Offerman is perhaps best known for his seven-season run as Ron Swanson on the NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation. He won an Emmy for his guest role playing Bill in the first season of The Last of Us.
A sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie is set to be released next year. In October, Toad voice actor Keegan-Michael Key teased that the follow-up filmwill feature some Nintendo characters that are ‚Äúreally deep cuts.‚Äù
The record-breaking The Super Mario Bros. Movie features a long list of Nintendo characters, but still some were left on the table. In an interview withMen's Journal, Key said the sequel will include characters that weren‚Äôt in the first film, some of which should please the most hardcore of Nintendo fans.
‚ÄúI feel like what they've done creatively is they've really widened out the universe that these characters live in and we're going to meet some new folks,‚Äù Key said.
‚ÄúWe're going to meet some new folks that are old favorites and some folks that I think are really deep cuts, but because of the way the story's laying itself out right now, those characters are going to be very intriguing.‚Äù
But who? Nintendo fans have speculated about all sorts of characters who‚Äôd fit the ""deep cut"" bill, ranging from more well-known picks such as Bowser Jr and Rosalina to Tatanga and Toadette. For now, we don‚Äôt know who exactly to expect, but Key did say the second movie is ‚Äúa little broader in scope, and where it takes place is very intriguing lore and the Mario world.‚Äù
Nintendo and Illumination announced the next Super Mario Bros. Movielast year with a release date of April 3, 2026. While not much was revealed, it was confirmed that The Super Mario Bros. Movie directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic will return.
Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto said at the time: ""We'll let you know the details once we're ready to share more. This time too, the staff at Illumination and Nintendo are working together. We're thinking about broadening Mario's world further, and it'll have a bright and fun story. We hope you'll look forward to it!""
Before the sequel was confirmed, Bowser voice actor Jack Black, who's set to star in A Minecraft Movie as Steve, said he‚Äôd like to show off more of his vocal chops in any follow up,as he had pitched the idea of a musical titled Bowser's Revenge. ""I think it should be a full musical, like what Todd Phillips is supposedly doing with Joker 2,"" he said.
Bowser's romantic ode to Princess Peach in The Super Mario Bros. Movie became an instant hit,landing a place on the Billboard Hot 100, but Black was initially hesitant about singing in the film. He toldIGNthat he tries ""not to do too many crossovers"" where his characters sing, but he couldn't pass up a love song.
The Last of Us Season 2, meanwhile, debuts April 13, 2025.

The Legend of Zelda: Everything We Know About the Live-Action Movie,2025-03-29T15:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-live-action-director-plot-cast-trailer-release-date-nintendo,"The Legend of Zelda live-action movieis in active development at Nintendo and Sony Pictures fora March 2027 release. It‚Äôs early days yet for the hotly anticipated feature film adaptation of the blockbuster video game franchise ‚Äì which, after years of rumors, wasofficially announced in November 2023‚Äì so here‚Äôs what we know for sure about the movie so far.

The film is being produced by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Avi Arad, chairman of Arad Productions and former founder and CEO of Marvel Studios. Sony Pictures Entertainment will handle theatrical distribution in addition to co-financing the movie with Nintendo. Jurassic World‚Äôs Derek Connolly is writing the screenplay.
Wes Ball, who made the Maze Runner movies and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, is directing Zelda. As if he was fated to land the job,Ball actually tweeted about wanting to make a Zelda movie way back in 2010.
At that time, Ball said he envisioned his Zelda as being another mo-cap endeavor like James Cameron‚Äôs Avatar. More recently, the filmmaker said he wants his Legend of Zelda to be ‚Äúthis awesome fantasy-adventure movie that isn‚Äôt like Lord of the Rings, it‚Äôs its own thing. I've always said, I would love to see a live-action Miyazaki. That wonder and whimsy that he brings to things, I would love to see something like that.""
In a later interview, Ball backed off of his 2010 notion of making it a mo-cap movie. In May 2024, Ball said makingan all mo-cap Zelda movie ‚Äúprobably isn't his choice‚Äùsince he was just coming off of the CG-heavy KIngdom of the Planet of the Apes. Ball‚Äôs aim is to make Legend of Zelda feel ""grounded"" and ""real."" He added, ‚ÄúWe're working hard, and we're gonna make something great.""
Ball has also said: ""I want to fulfil people's greatest desires. I know it's important, this [Zelda] franchise, to people, and I want it to be a serious movie. A real movie that can give people an escape. ‚Ä¶ [The film has] ""to feel like something real. Something serious and cool but fun and whimsical.""
A die hard Zelda fan who said he grew up on the franchise, Ball unintentionally stirred up other fans whenhe refused to tell IGN last year what his favorite Zelda game was.
No one has been cast yet but The Sixth Sense‚ÄôsHaley Joel Osment expressed his desire to land a role in the Zelda moviewhen he appeared onIGN Arcade. Euphoria‚ÄôsHunter Schafer has expressed interest in playing Princess Zelda.
Euphoria star Hunter Schafer is a fan of the Nintendo series, saying, ‚ÄúI love the game, personally. I played it as a kid and I still play it now. Who knows! That would be pretty cool.‚Äùpic.twitter.com/lDNB1BkEqJ
Fan reaction when the movie was officially announcedback in November 2023 was swift and opinionated. Some took umbrage at Avi Arad ‚Äì the former boss of Marvel Studios who also produced Ghost in the Shell and the early Spider-Man movies ‚Äì being involved (‚ÄúCan't believe they were able to get the producer of the hit film Morbius!!‚Äù). Others weren‚Äôt thrilled by the selection of Wes Ball to direct.
The decision to make the Legend of Zelda a live-action movie was met with trepidation: ‚ÄúPeople can say Zelda plot doesn't work in live action but action films have hardly ever relied on deep, complex plots to engage people.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnimated would have been the way to go if you ask me.‚Äù
IGN editors also expressed their thoughts aboutwhy Zelda should be an animated movie instead of live-action. ‚ÄúAnd while hand-drawn art may be the best fit for a Zelda movie in my opinion, there are plenty of animation styles that would serve as a better vehicle for Zelda than live-action,‚Äù IGN‚Äôs Logan Plant wrote at the time the movie was announced.
‚ÄúThink about all the gorgeous animated projects we‚Äôve seen in the last several years: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Dragon Quest: Your Story, the Castlevania anime, or even a claymation look come to mind as visual styles that would perfectly suit the wonderful world of Hyrule. I can visualize what all these versions of Hyrule would look like, but I can‚Äôt say the same thing about live-action.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere are so many oddities in Zelda that come across as charming when animated, but could easily be seen as off-putting when done in live-action. This is a franchise where a literal enormous pig is the main villain, after all. But Zelda is also full of surprising horrors, from zombies that wrap their entire bodies around Link to try and kill him, to disembodied giant hands that swoop down from the ceiling. I have a hard time seeing a lot of Zelda enemies make it into a live-action movie without seriously frightening the little ones.‚Äù
IGN‚Äôs Matt Kim also opined at the time thatit would be ‚Äúa trap‚Äù if Nintendo and Ball tried to adapt Breath of the Wildfor the silver screen: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to make a Zelda movie, I‚Äôd adapt one of the games where the story is a bit more center-stage, whether it‚Äôs the pirate adventures of Wind Waker, the classic sword and sorcery of A Link to the Past, or arguably the most cinematic Zelda game of all-time, Twilight Princess.‚Äù
‚ÄúGame devs have marveled at the power of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom‚Äôs engineering, calling the way its systems interact with each other near-magic. It‚Äôs not just showing audiences Link‚Äôs cool abilities but playing within an entire world, with its own laws of nature that just simply cannot be conveyed by looking at a screen alone. While there are plenty of fun moments a Breath of the Wild movie could include as fun easter eggs ‚Äî like Link discovering he gets a stat bonus when he cooks during the blood moon for example ‚Äî the game‚Äôs sense of discovery can never truly be captured on camera. ‚Ä¶ Breath of the Wild turns players into theoretical physicists, experimenting with how the interlocking rules of the game play off one another ‚Äì which, unless the director plans on making a movie similar to Oppenheimer, would make for not a lousy Zelda movie.‚Äù
For their part, the filmmakers acknowledge the risk inherent in making a live-action Zelda movie. ""Regarding the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda,I know we face an extremely high hurdlein producing a film that will not disappoint the global fan base,"" Shigeru Miyamoto told Nintendo investors during a Q&A in November 2023. Miyamoto added that he had been developing the Zelda movie with Arad for ten years prior to the official announcement.
Sony Pictures will release The Legend of Zelda in theaters on March 26, 2027. In order to make that date, fans should expect filming to commence in 2026 or maybe even late this year to allow for enough post-production time to pull of the film‚Äôs visual effects.
There isn‚Äôt one as nothing has been filmed yet. However, IGN pranked the Internet on April Fool‚Äôs Day 2008 when we releaseda faux live-action Zelda movie trailer(which can be viewed below). Until there‚Äôs a real movie trailer to watch, ours will have to do:
Who do you think should play Link, Zelda and other key characters in the upcoming movie? Let us know in the comments."
10 Ways Switch 2 Is Better than Switch,2025-04-05T14:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/10-ways-switch-2-is-better-than-switch,"Rejoice, fellow Nintendo fans. On Wednesday, the clouds parted, the sun rose, and the divine spectra; hand of Miyamoto reached down from the sky to grace us with Nintendo‚Äôs newest handheld carnival of joy, the Switch 2. After years of speculation, we finally have a clear look at the mysterious console hybrid.

Sadly, while sleek, compact, and powerful, the rumours are untrue. The Switch 2 does not in fact pack a tiny little Reggie into every GPU. But after we spent an hour during the Direct glued to every word: dissecting it, screenshotting every image, poring over captured video for tiny clues to its form and function, we can finally apply something besides guesswork and give you some solid facts, including all the ways it leaves its beloved predecessor in the dust.
This is probably the least-surprising revelation as practically every next-gen Nintendo console has been significantly improved over its predecessor (yes, even the Wii). Still, when released in 2017, Switch was hardly a cutting-edge powerhouse in comparison to Sony and Xbox consoles, and eight years later it noticeably struggles under demanding games. Nintendo and its partners were increasingly running up against the limitations of the hardware.
This week we saw elements on display promising us a vastly improved experience: handheld resolutions up to 1080p, docked up to 4K, both with HDR, and framerates extending up to 120 fps. It‚Äôs a welcome upgrade that should allow a wider variety of games to come to Switch 2. We may already see some of the fruit in EA‚Äôs decision to host soccer and football games on Switch 2, and 2K‚Äôs intention to do the same with wrestling and basketball.
Third parties revealed all manner of current-gen games to give us some idea of the Switch 2‚Äôs increased capabilities, and what we saw was encouraging: a console/handheld capable of handling Elden Ring, Street Fighter 6, and other demanding software. And what Nintendo showed of their new first-party offerings was simply gorgeous.
The little purple lunchbox that could finally comes to Nintendo Switch Online, exclusively available on Switch 2. Nintendo has effectively drawn a fence between online experiences on Switch and Switch 2, and that means that from this point forward those who want to play some of Nintendo‚Äôs best retro games are going to have to shell out for better hardware. Sure, it‚Äôs only three games right now, but those three games are absolute bangers: The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and, holy crap, Soul Calibur 2, complete with Link.
Okay, seriously. Soul Calibur 2 is incredible. If you‚Äôve never played it with a friend you are in for such a treat.
When humanity later reviews and catalogues the glorious day in video game history, the opening chapter won‚Äôt be about how Mario Kart is now like Forza Horizon, or about Donkey Kong‚Äôs return in Bananza, or even about the announcement of the until-now secret project called Duskblood. Instead, the book will open and perhaps also close with the most significantly un-Nintendo thing to happen this week: easy integration of online features commonly available on other platforms.
The company that brought us Friend Codes now graces us with GameChat, a feature-rich communication and visual sharing feature set for Switch 2. A noise-cancelling mic picks up your voice and shares it with friends. An optional desktop camera allows you to share your face, both in window-corners and in compatible games like Mario Party. You can also share screens across consoles remotely. It‚Äôs much of what we gave up on asking Nintendo for years ago... a simple, straightforward tool for playing with friends. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how it actually plays out.
So much potential awaits with this feature. Where my mind keeps going is Monster Hunter, with teams of four benefitting from shared screens as they pursue and trap their prey. It‚Äôs simply become unthinkable for Nintendo to voluntarily offer fans such a useful array of online features, but here we are living in the future at last.
Okay, we‚Äôd already guessed this but it‚Äôs still really cool. Joy-Cons now magnetically snap to the Switch 2 body rather than slotting in. Nintendo showed off how the steel shoulder buttons on each controller attract to the magnetic facing along the sides of the screen, locking them together. A press of a button releases the magnetic grip.
This is a pretty great feature for my home setup, where a shelf top obstructs removing the Joy-Cons without removing the entire Switch from the dock, which sometimes leads to knocking the whole thing down. I‚Äôm a fan.
Bigger isn‚Äôt always better with handhelds, but given the sharper resolution of the 1080p portable screen and the nature of most Switch games, the slight increase in size to 7.9 inches should be a net gain for most players. The first Switch sacrificed screen real estate for portability but I think Nintendo is making the right call in giving these elaborate, feature -rich games more space to shine.
Nintendo was weirdly excited to show off its innovative Joy-Con mouse features. A Switch 2 Joy-Con laid on its side can be scooted across a tabletop, and its telemetry tracked to provide precise pointing and rotation. It looks to be heavily-supported at launch by games like Drag x Drive, Civ 7, and Metroid Prime 4.
I do love wacky Nintendo. My guess is the mouse feature won‚Äôt see much use past launch window (much like the microphone on the old DS) but I‚Äôm actually 1000% in on playing Metroid Prime 4 with a mouse. As a PC gamer, I rarely enjoy FPS games that force me to use a controller, so this surprising option feels a bit liberating. Hopefully we get Mario Paint 2.
This one is more of a double-edged sword. Nintendo crammed the Switch 2 with 256GB of external storage, much more than the original Switch. But with all the Switch 2‚Äôs extra graphics capacity, those asset-rich game files are going to be much bigger too, so it may be close to a wash. The memory is quicker as well to deal with larger game files, which means you‚Äôll need a new, faster memory card for your supplemental storage.
Nintendo tweaked the Switch hardware in response to nearly a decade of feedback. Switch 2 now features two USB-C ports, with one added on top to assist in charging while playing in kickstand mode. Nintendo added a fan to the doc to aid in cooling consistency. Sticks are larger and sound capabilities are improved.
Even the Switch 2 Pro Controller is a step up, with an audio jack (at last!) and assignable buttons. No telling yet if the new controller contains the same miniaturized star that exists at the core of every Switch Pro Controller, giving it near-unlimited battery life.
And one of the most subtle features might be most useful. I do a fair bit of Switch playing on my tabletop. The fact that the Switch 2 screen angle is adjustable in kickstand mode is a huge deal for me. Too often, ambient light at an airport or the angle of a tight airplane tray table make playing in kickstand seem like an exercise in futility. But with the ability to subtly shift angles, coupled with the new mouse feature, leads me to believe I might actually be able to enjoy a serious game of Civilization 7 on the go.
So first off, Switch 2 is backward compatible. That‚Äôs always good. Microsoft has already blazed a pretty amazing trail toward optimized backward compatibility on Xbox, and Nintendo has also wisely taken a note from its own Gamecube to Wii to WiiU history, making most Switch games a snap to play on new hardware. Backward capacity helps sell consoles their first year.
While the Nintendo Switch 2 is backward compatible with Switch games, it also supports special new Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of certain Switch titles like Metroid Prime 4. These enhanced titles offer new features including a selection between a higher-res Quality Mode or a faster frame rate in Performance Mode.
One really cool feature of these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions is that if you already own the original game on Switch, you will be able to purchase a simple Switch 2 Edition upgrade and enjoy all the new features on your new hardware.  Let's hope it's not too expensive.
It‚Äôs also possible that Switch 2 Editions of Switch‚Äôs notoriously-janky Pokemon games could be improved by these features. Let's hope so. Throwing hardware at things can‚Äôt solve every problem but sometimes it really helps.
Mario Kart World does everything we expect of Mario Kart and adds two key elements. The first is the ability to traverse a continuous world Forza Horizon-style, racing from course to course, free mode exploring, fooling around, and so on. The second is the swelling of the field size to 24 carts, which is, well, a lot to get one‚Äôs head around when the shells start flying. It sounds like absolute bedlam. I can‚Äôt wait.
Nintendo took its time showing off new games but toward the end of the show we bought about a minute tease of a new Kirby‚Äôs Air Ride game, Kirby‚Äôs Air Riders, an announcement that would likely have resulted in a thunderous snooze were it not for the surprising involvement of one Mr. Sakurai, known equally for his self-immolating work ethic and his status as god of Smash Bros. I love Kirby, but Air Ride sucked... BUT it‚Äôs Sakurai so I‚Äôm now 100% in.
Then there was The Duskbloods, a trailer that produced some hysterics in me. At first I thought it was Bloodborne 2, then I thought it was a licensed FROM Software take on Castlevania, and then finally I accepted that what I was seeing was an entirely original Miyazaki game exclusive to Switch. My friends, remember: FROM Software does not miss. Probably you will die. Probably you will dodge roll. Certainly you will have a blast.
And of course; the real King of Kong makes his triumphant return to 3D with Donkey Kong Bananza. It‚Äôs a moment of absolution for Nintendo: 26 years after dropping the barbequed turd Donkey Kong 64 on an unsuspecting planet, a wiser, more skilled Nintendo has returned to the drawing board with what‚Äôs sure to be a landmark adventure.
Nintendo devs have been absolutely murdering 3D platforming on the Switch, not just with Odyssey and Bowser‚Äôs Fury, but also with Kirby‚Äôs incredible journey to the shores of the Forgotten Lands. Bananza was constructed to showcase far more capable hardware than these modern-day classics, which means that the devs had opportunities to iterate on ideas that wouldn‚Äôt have been possible on a basic Switch.

Donkey Kong Bananza: First Hands-On Preview,2025-04-03T13:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-first-hands-on-preview,"For the last several years it‚Äôs felt like Nintendo just hasn‚Äôt cared that much about Donkey Kong. As Nintendo gifted pretty much every one of its cherished characters their best outingeveron Switch, the great ape who once stood high atop the girders of Nintendo‚Äôs essential arcade cabinet faceplanted hard on the concrete with a litany of ports, remakes, and remasters. But on Switch 2, Nintendo is finally giving one of gaming‚Äôs biggest icons the love he deserves with abrand new, flagship, launch window 3D action-platformer, and if the first 30 minutes we spent with Donkey Kong Bananza are any indication, Mario‚Äôs original rival is looking poised to stand tall once again.

It‚Äôs hard to talk about Bananza without referencing that darn plumber as just seconds after jumping into its Underground World, the significant parallels to Super Mario Odyssey became abundantly clear. While Nintendo hasn‚Äôt confirmed the developers of Bananza, after playing it we‚Äôre willing to bet Odyssey developer Nintendo EPD Tokyo is behind it.
Bananza‚Äôs setup will feel instantly familiar to anyone who‚Äôs spent hours throwing Cappy and collecting Power Moons. DK is joined by an adorable assistant (this time in the form of a purple rock who talks and sings) to scour self-contained explorable sandboxes for Golden Bananas, some of which are found by completing story missions while others are sprinkled across the landscape just waiting to be found. As you explore, you find isolated linear challenge rooms that dial back the exploration in favor of testing your combat and platforming abilities. There are other collectibles to find too, like gold presumably playing the role of coins, dozens of fossils (which we didn‚Äôt find a use for during our demo) and currency  we‚Äôre hoping will be used to outfit Donkey Kong in the local flavor. Even the UI is reminiscent of Mario‚Äôs globetrotting adventure! So if you were disappointed  the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct lacked a big, flashy 3D Mario, I'm here to tell you that Donkey Kong Bananza feels like the sequel to that formula we‚Äôve been clamoring for, it just happens to star the giant monkey instead.
Like the best Nintendo games, Donkey Kong‚Äôs brand new moveset completely suits him as a character and feels right the moment you step into his shoes (okay, big hairy feet). Bananza is furiously fast and delightfully destructive as Donkey Kong can demolish most of the terrain in his path, and we spent our demo transforming the lush opening area filled with grass, trees, and lakes into DK‚Äôs personal chaotic excavation site. DK punches forward, upward, and downward, instantly destroying most materials and oftentimes carving a makeshift path to follow that can lead to entirely new areas. At one point I was punching through a mountain just for the heck of it and a valuable collectible fell into my lap, so there‚Äôs definitely value to breaking ground everywhere you can ‚Äì it may lead to a groundbreaking discovery.
If pulverizing every stone wall in sight sounds overwhelming, it really didn‚Äôt feel that way in the moment, which is likely due to how much fun we had controlling Donkey Kong. In addition to turning everything to rubble, Donkey Kong can also pick up giant stone boulders from the ground, walls, or wherever, and hurl them to obliterate nearby enemies. Or, he takes a page out of Link‚Äôs book and can use the stone slab to boogie board at a rapid pace across the landscape. There are surely dozens of unique moves and chain combos waiting to be discovered and I can imagine how much fun speedrunners will have trying to master DK‚Äôs moveset, which already feels ripe with expressiveness and possibility.
Bananza‚Äôs central theme of exploration via destruction was present throughout every second of our demo, even down to the map screen. Instead of a simple top-down overview of the landscape, the map here is a fully-rendered 3D model of the entire areain its current state,meaning when you pause to get your bearings, you can see all of the walls you‚Äôve punched and caves you‚Äôve carved. It‚Äôs like the Hero‚Äôs Path feature in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom cranked up to 11, and it felt like an incredibly impressive touch.
That map helped us track down challenge rooms which rewarded us either with Golden Bananas or a ton of cash. And unlike Odyssey, there‚Äôs no more wondering if you have a Moon left to find and going inside to wait for Cappy to tell you, because the entrance to each bonus room tracks how many Golden Bananas you‚Äôve found and how many more are waiting within. We saw three of these rooms in Bananza‚Äôs opening area, with each focusing on either platforming, combat, or destruction: we had to monkey bar our way through an obstacle course, take down three stone enemies before time ran out, and blast through as much gold ore as possible to take home a big payday. They were all fun and unique and left me excited to see what other challenges are in store.
I also think Bananza is on track to be one of the most gorgeous Nintendo games I‚Äôve seen. It really does take advantage of Switch 2's hardware ‚Äì the environments are beautiful and DK‚Äôs animations are wonderfully expressive, and I left feeling like the next generation of first-party Nintendo games had truly arrived.
Donkey Kong Bananza is out July 17 for $69.99, and I might destroy my entire house if I have to wait that long to play it again.
Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager & Playlist Editor. He played the entire Donkey Kong Country series earlier this year and is so excited for a brand new DK game. It's way overdue!"

"ESA Responds to Trump Tariffs: ‚ÄòIf We Think It‚Äôs Just the Switch 2, Then We Aren‚Äôt Taking it Seriously‚Äô",2025-04-04T17:09:11Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/esa-responds-to-trump-tariffs-if-we-think-its-just-the-switch-2-then-we-arent-taking-it-seriously,"It‚Äôs been a wild 48-hour news cycle if you follow economics at all, and wilder still if you‚Äôre a Nintendo fan.

On Wednesday, we learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 would cost $450 in the United States, a painfully high price thatanalysts saywas partly due to expectation of tariffs, and partly due to other factors like inflation, competition, and component costs.
Then, last night, the Trump Administrationannounced wide-reaching 10% tariffson essentially every country, with much higher tariffs on numerous nations such as China, the EU, Japan, Vietnam, Canada, Mexico, and many, many others. In response, Chinaannounced this morninga 34% reciprocal tariff on all U.S. goods. And just hours ago, in the wake of all this, Nintendo announced it would bepostponing Nintendo Switch 2 pre-ordersin the U.S. while it evaluated the impact of tariffs on its console plans.
It‚Äôs an unprecedented situation for everyone, both within and outside of gaming, and one that analysts, experts, and the general public are still trying to make sense of. Which is why just a short 30 minutes before Nintendo dropped its shocking pre-order news, I was on the phone with Aubrey Quinn, a spokesperson for the Entertainment Software Association, to discuss the impact these tariffs would have on the industry writ large.
The ESA, like everyone else, is still trying to figure out how all this is going to play out. Broadly, she says, they have some expectations. They knew tariffs of some sort were coming ‚Äì both due to Trump‚Äôs past actions in his first administration and his repeated discussion of them on the campaign trail. And, once implemented, Quinn says they expected there would be risk of retaliation from other countries like China, as well as even more future tariffs and levies from the U.S. But the jury is still out on how this will ultimately play out.
What the ESA does feel confident saying, though, is that these tariffs will have a negative impact on video games:
‚ÄúWe really are, at this point, just watching and trying not to have knee-jerk reactions, because we don't think that what President Trump announced this week is the end of the story, but what was announced this week and the tariffs as outlined, we do expect these tariffs will have a real and detrimental impact on the industry and the hundreds of millions of Americans who love to play games,‚Äù Quinn says. ‚ÄúAnd so our goal is to work with the administration, to work with other elected officials to try to find a solution that doesn't damage U.S. industries, U.S. business, but also American gamers and families.‚Äù
When Quinn says there will be a detrimental impact, she doesn‚Äôt just mean the cost of systems, though she says it‚Äôs ‚Äúhard to imagine a world where tariffs like these don‚Äôt impact pricing.‚Äù She says consumer spending will also be impacted, which will in turn impact company revenue. If companies see their profits drop, that will in turn impact jobs, as well as investment in research and development, and even what the next generation of consoles looks like. ‚ÄúThe entire consumer ecosystem is connected,‚Äù she says.
So what‚Äôs the ESA doing about it? Well, a few things so far, but Quinn acknowledges it‚Äôs been difficult to get started. Even though the tariffs didn‚Äôt come as a surprise to anyone, she says the Trump Administration hasn‚Äôt been back in office for long ‚Äì really just two months. Trump‚Äôs cabinet and administration is almost entirely made up of new people, too, so the ESA hasn‚Äôt been able to leverage relationships from his last term in office. And some of them were only appointed weeks ago.
‚ÄúBut yes, the short answer is we know who the conversations need to be happening with, and we are working on making connections and making sure that they understand that we are eager to work with them to find solutions that this is about public, private sector conversations happening, so we can understand and make sure that they see the impact and the risk of impact to business, to consumers, and really everything that's happening within the US borders,‚Äù she concludes.
Quinn points to the recent news that the ESA had already joined a coalition of trade associations to reach out to U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer and express their concerns prior to the tariff news earlier this week. And they‚Äôre asking for meetings with a number of legislations and members of the administration to discuss similar topics.
Is it working, I ask? Are they being heard?
‚ÄúYes. I can tell you conversations are happening with... I don't want to say every level,‚Äù she responds. ‚ÄúI've not met with Trump, right? So I don't want to say every level of government, but certainly we've met with members of the administration. We've met with employees at the White House, we've met with employees at USTR [the office of the United States Trade Representative], so yes, we are having conversations and we're also doing that in partnership with other associations to make sure that... This isn't a video game issue. I represent the video game industry, so I'm very aware of the impact on the video game industry, the potential impact, but it's not a video game industry. This is going to affect all consumer products from food to fashion to electronics.‚Äù
So what can consumers do about it if they‚Äôre concerned? Reach out to their representatives, Quinn responds. Write letters, call, send emails, tweets, whatever it looks like to let their elected leaders know they‚Äôre concerned. ‚ÄúI think the more members of government, elected officials, and their staff who hear that their constituents are concerned, the more likely we are to be heard and to potentially make an impact.‚Äù
Nintendo announced its hold on Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders due to the tariffs just minutes after our conversation had concluded. When I reached out to Quinn for further comment on that, she said the ESA doesn‚Äôt comment on what individual companies will do. But I did mention the Nintendo Switch 2‚Äôs already-high pricing at the end of our conversation, and Quinn had this to say:
‚ÄúYou know what? It's been interesting with media coverage around video games and tariffs because just unfortunate coincidental timing that the Switch [2 reveal] was the same day as President Trump's announcement. There are so many devices we play video games on. There are other consoles, but as I was saying, VR headsets, our smartphones, people who love PC games, if we think it's just the Switch, then we aren't taking it seriously. This is going to have an impact.
‚ÄúAnd even American-based companies, they're getting products that need to cross into American borders to make those consoles, to make those games. And so there's going to be a real impact regardless of company. This is company-agnostic, this is an entire industry. There's going to be an impact on the entire industry.‚Äù

In retro news, I'm using a NOS burst to light 26 candles on a cake forNeed For Speed: High Stakes. This beloved racing game wasn't just about sating one's velocity requirements while unlocking new whips; lose a High Stakes race, and you'd perma-lose your car. Us launch adopters loved that risk-versus-reward structure and the groundbreaking damage system that would go on to influence the future of racing simulations.
Better yet, we had I highly localised Aussie version with Holden VT Clubsport and Ford AU Falcon XR8 featured prominently on the cover. Even cooler, winning the special HSV Pro Cup would unlock Craig Lowndes' MHRT VT Commo'. Using it to evade the fuzz down Durham Road (preferably in split-screen PvP) was mighty boss stuff.

The Coziest LEGO Animal Crossing Set Just Hit an All-Time Low Price on Amazon,2025-03-25T17:25:37Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-animal-crossing-set-deal-amazon-spring-sale-2025,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is one of my overall favorite games. I first started playing it back in 2020 like everyone else and have been started up a new island several times since then. The series is just so cozy and stress-free, and LEGO has done a great job of capturing that aesthetic. LEGO has released quite a few Animal Crossing sets as it continues to build up theLEGO Nintendo brand, but the one that I personally like the most has just dropped to its lowest ever price.

The LEGO K.K.'s Concert in the Plaza set has dropped down to only $41.20 as part of theAmazon Spring Deal Days Sale. That's a 48% discount that drops the price lower than we've ever seen it before.
This LEGO Animal Crossing set wasfirst released back in August 2024alongside the Fly with Dodo Airlines set and various new LEGO Mario options. Tthe price has only recently started to drop, and with this discount it'slower than it has ever been beforeon Amazon. It's unlikely we will see a lower price than this, even for Prime Day or Black Friday, so right now is a great time to buy if you've already been considering it.
The set itself is only 550 pieces, so it can be easily put together in an afternoon. The centerpiece of the set is the classic Plaza and Resident services where Tom Nook is usually located, but it also comes with K.K's driveable camper van, a caf√©, and a little tree permanently stuck in fall. You also get a little minifigure K.K. Slider (guitar included), Isabelle, and Audie. AlthoughK.K. Slider songsare not included, you could always have them play in the background while you put it together.
LEGO has been fairly consistent in releasing new Nintendo sets each year. Last year there were several months where new LEGO Animal Crossing sets came out, and most recently we hadthree new sets arrive in January 2025. That being said, there are currently no new Animal Crossing sets that have been announced for this year. More may arrive in the second half of the year, but right now, there are still only 10 sets featured on theLEGO Animal Crossing page."
Mario Kart World for Nintendo Switch 2: First Hands-On Preview,2025-04-03T13:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview,"Mario Kart Worldis the first new home console Mario Kart game in a decade. We went hands-on with this Nintendo Switch 2 launch title and played a ton of it across several different modes, so let‚Äôs break it all down!

Mario Kart‚Äôs biggest new addition centers around a huge, new Forza Horizon-style world filled with tons of courses to race against friends and enemies on. Instead of just having a series of tracks you select from a menu (although you‚Äôll have that option too) Mario Kart World features a massive playground you can explore at your own pace on your own or with friends. You use this place to cruise around for fun or launch into races, Grand Prix tournaments, and more. It‚Äôs also packed with collectibles and hidden secrets and areas, and while we don‚Äôt know just yet what the rewards will be for finding things hidden throughout this world, we‚Äôre hoping it‚Äôs stuff like karts or costumes, or that you‚Äôll be able to spend coins in some kind of shop for cool cosmetic stuff. Poking around here between races led me to what looked like a strange Peach-themed coin, stacks of smaller, regular coins, a huge evil cloud, a ton of grind rails to practice on, hidden back alleys and pathways, and so much more. It‚Äôs grand, utterly gorgeous, and incredibly smooth. We got used to how great Mario Kart 8 looked, but this one is even prettier and more stylish, with better draw distance, more detailed characters and environments, and generally just a ton of stuff happening at once.
BookmarkIGN's Switch 2 preorder guide today, and when anything goes live, we'll post links the moment they become available. Get notified when a Nintendo Switch 2 console, game, or accessory preorder listing goes live by following IGN Deals onTwitter/XorBluesky.
Mechanically, everything felt really tight and satisfying so even if there isn‚Äôt a ton of reward for exploring it‚Äôs still really fun to explore. But knowing Nintendo, they‚Äôll definitely be reasons to poke around here. In general, the gameplay feels like a slightly tighter and more forgiving version of Mario Kart 8, so if you spent a ton of time there you‚Äôll feel right at home here. When your kart gets smashed by an item or another player, your recovery time is snappier and you‚Äôre back in the competition quicker than in previous Mario Kart games. When an opponent cuts you off and steals an item box right before you can get to it, don‚Äôt stress it because they respawn almost immediately, giving you a chance for instant green shell vengeance. Gliders have been replaced with planes, underwater sections have been replaced with Wave Race-like boating areas, and you don‚Äôt customize your kart anymore, at least in the version I played. There were a lot of preset kart options to start with and presumably many more to unlock, though, so it seems like having lots of ways to show off your kart or character won‚Äôt be limited.
You can play Mario Kart World with up to 24 human players at the same time and there are tons of returning characters from the Mario series, although none from other Nintendo games like Mario Kart 8 had. It‚Äôs safe to say that Mario Kart World will be THE Mario Kart game for years to come, though, so who knows which characters from other series will show up here eventually. My favorite new character was Cow from Moo Moo Meadows, who is here to get revenge for all the times you drove into his family on the N64, probably. Most characters have different costumed versions  you can choose from the character select screen, but where things get a bit more complicated is that you can also change their costume mid-race by finding certain power-ups that appear to alter your stats. Lots of these items are food-based so you‚Äôll get to see Cow eat a burger. Look, it‚Äôs his first time driving a kart and it‚Äôs crazy out there. Go easy on him.
We also noticed a bunch of characters that appear as racers against you but you can‚Äôt choose yourself just yet, like the Piantas from Super Mario Sunshine and the Conkdors from Super Mario 3D World, so we suspect they‚Äôll be unlockable and the roster will only get bigger. There‚Äôs also some great new items like throwable hammers and a question block that gives you a ton of coins in a row. Some classic items even have altered functionality, like lightning not lasting as long or blue shells having cartoon phrases pop up when they hit you, but the coolest new upgrade we noticed is that every throwable item now automatically drags behind your kart without you having to hold down a button to do it. It‚Äôs one less thing to worry about, which is nice because you now have so many new things to worry about!
Knockout Tour is the biggest race mode ever included in this series and it feels awesome. You start out in the open world, driving around and hanging out with friends while your race populates with 23 other players. Then, you‚Äôll all choose a set of interconnected Grand Prix tracks you want to race on. Once the race kicks off, you need to stay out of the bottom four in each segment or you‚Äôll get eliminated and booted back to the open world. So, the field is culled each lap from 24, to 20, to 16, all the way until there are only four racers left for the final segment. It‚Äôs incredibly fun and the tracks, endless items, kart racers, and general chaos make every race feel absolutely frenetic. Think the final lap of Baby Park on Mario Kart: Double Dash where it‚Äôs chaos and clutter everywhere, but with the aggressive goal of making sure you‚Äôre taking down others constantly to advance.
This mode was incredibly fun. Going from 4th place to 12th place in a Mario Kart game has been a thing for ages, but going from 2nd to 22nd because a series of bad luck or poor decisions put you behind the pack is a brand new feeling, and watching that happen and then getting instantly eliminated from the entire race (or doing it to somebody else) is absolutely hilarious. Generally, this feature adds some much needed urgency and aggression to Mario Kart and it‚Äôs utterly thrilling. Nintendo has been experimenting with this elimination style gameplay with lots of their franchises in the past few years, like Mario 35 and F-Zero 99, but it feels like such a perfect fit for Mario Kart and we suspect it‚Äôs gonna be a massive hit with both kids and the streamer crowds. Knockout Tour modes last much longer than a typical race, assuming you don‚Äôt get knocked out of the whole thing super early.
Mario Kart World is $80!Everything we‚Äôve seen and played is awesome and we can‚Äôt wait for it, but nothing about this game so far really screams ‚Äúeighty dollar product.‚Äù Nintendo experimented with a $70 price tag on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and we suspect we‚Äôll spend just as much time (or more) playing Mario Kart World throughout the Switch 2 lifespan, but it‚Äôs hard not to feel cynical about about this price, like Nintendo knows that Mario Kart 8 was the best-selling Switch game and one of the best-selling games of all time and that the successor will be a guaranteed hit, so hey, might as well upcharge us. If it came with a year of Switch Online or some sort of season pass of unlockable content it‚Äôd be a slightly easier pill to swallow, but as far as we know it doesn‚Äôt. Getting the game bundled with a Switch 2 drops the price down to $50 and since it will be there on the system‚Äôs launch day that‚Äôs likely how most players will get it, but still, the whole thing definitely stings a bit.
Regardless, Mario Kart World feels like the definitive Switch 2 launch game and will certainly be one of the defining games of the Switch 2 generation. The new open world format and Knockout Tour modes are massive new additions to the franchise, the visuals are gorgeous, the gameplay is a blast, and we can‚Äôt wait to play more, even if we wish it was a few bucks cheaper.
Brian Altano has been playing Mario Kart for 30+ years, and it's crazy that 10 of those years were spent with Mario Kart 8. We haven't seen Battle Mode for Mario Kart World yet, but he's still holding out hope that Block Fort can come back. Bring back Block Fort!"

In retro news, I'm (somehow) celebrating the 23rd birthday of the OG Xbox, a console that blew my mind at launch (even though I was happily married to a PS2). This was the chunky vehicle that brought Microsoft into the console gaming world. And while it didn't have the prettiest design or the greatest library of games, it gave us two important contributions to gaming:Haloand Xbox Live.
While some N64 enthusiasts may argue thatGoldenEyepaved the way for quality console first-person shooters, it wasHalothat revolutionised the genre. Almost every FPS that came after Halo utilised its control scheme and a modified version of its health system. But where Halo truly succeeded was in providing console gamers with the first-of-its-kind 16-player LAN battles. This was the first shooter that made my PC gaming mates jealous, and I still own and adore myLimited Edition Crystal Xbox. Even though ants once tried to take it over and turn it into a very expensive vivarium.

"AU Deals: Monster Hunter Wilds Bitten Down to 89 Bucks, Pay a Pittance for Potterverse AAAs, and More!",2025-03-26T00:36:15Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/au-deals-monster-hunter-wilds-bitten-down-to-89-bucks-pay-a-pittance-for-potterverse-aaas-and-more,"If your game library is looking a little sparse, now‚Äôs the perfect time to grab some absolute bangers at heavily discounted prices! Whether you‚Äôre after high-speed action, epic RPG adventures, or deep strategy experiences, this week‚Äôs deals have something for every kind of gamer.

In retro news, I'm celebrating the 21st birthday of a series black sheep that still sold many a GameCube,Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. As a remake of the '98 PS classic, this was a pretty surreal (and, in parts, misguided) love letter. It was as if Snake had emerged from a time machine, equipped with the control scheme and acrobatics ofMGS 2: Sons of Liberty. Helmed by Silicon Knights and injected with the ""cinematic flair"" of Hollywood action director Ryuhei Kitamura, the end result divided fans quicker than a cyber-ninja disarming Ocelot.
Upgrades like first-person aiming and being able to hang/drop from ledges were a double-edged sword. While they made Snake more powerful and adaptable, they also turned sections of his Shadow Moses op into a cakewalk. The level design, originally built for the PS1‚Äôs limitations, just wasn‚Äôt fully rebalanced to accommodate these new mechanics, and some re-recorded voice performances weren't ideal. Be that as it Mei [Ling], I still recall loving this at launch and adore the copy I own.

"Star Wars Hunters Announces Shut Down Just 9 Months After Launch, Steam Release Appears Scrapped",2025-03-17T13:33:39Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-announces-shut-down-just-9-months-after-launch-steam-release-appears-scrapped,"Star Wars Hunterspublisher Zynga has announced plans for the game to shut down entirely just nine months after it was released, and it appears plans to launch a PC version of Steam are scrapped.

The NaturalMotion-developed, free-to-download team-based battle arena game launched on Nintendo Switch and iOS and Android in June 2024. IGN‚ÄôsStar Wars: Hunters reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: ‚ÄúStar Wars: Hunters‚Äô lighthearted PvP fun is like a party at the Death Star: Impressive for a bit, but probably not a place you‚Äôll want to hang around for too long.‚Äù
It seems the review was prescient, asZynga announcedthat ‚Äúafter careful consideration‚Äù it had decided the final content update for Star Wars: Hunters across all platforms would be released on April 15, with the game remaining playable until October 1, 2025.
‚ÄúWe understand this news may be disappointing and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly,‚Äù Zynga continued. ‚ÄúYour passion and dedication to the game and its community have meant the world to us, and we are committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process.‚Äù
Here are the logistics: on March 25, Season 5 will be extended by three weeks. Zynga will re-run events and shop bundles from the Season, and the Ranked Season will also be extended, giving players more time to hit Kyber 1 rank.
On April 15, the game‚Äôs final content update will be released for free and in-game purchases will be disabled across all platforms. New Support Hunter, Tuya, will join the game as part of the final update. Tuya will be available and playable for all users immediately at no cost, along with a slate of additional in-game content. Zynga will continue to run a final Ranked Mode leaderboard for players to compete in and run all battlefields and game modes in rotation.
And then, on October 1, online servers will officially shut down, and Star Wars: Hunters will no longer be playable beyond this point.
There‚Äôs no mention of the PC version,which was announced to launch on Steam in early access form this year, in the shutdown notice. Its Steam page now includes a notice that the game is ‚Äúno longer available on the Steam store.‚Äù
Take-Two-owned Zynga is best known for mobile games FarmVille, Words with Friends, and CSR Racing, but with Star Wars: Hunters it branched out to console for the first time. Similarly, Star Wars: Hunters was meant to be the first Zynga-published game to launch on PC.
‚ÄúThe success of Star Wars: Hunters on mobile and Nintendo Switch devices has led to our decision to expand the game to PC,‚Äù said Yaron Leyvan, executive vice president, games, at Zynga, back in November.
‚ÄúThis is something our community of fans have been asking for and we are very excited to welcome even more players to Vespaara. This moment also marks a milestone for Zynga as we bring one of our games to PC for the first time.‚Äù
There are still a number of Star Wars video games in the works, including Respawn Entertainment's third Star Wars Jedi game andBit Reactor's turn-based tactics game set to be revealed at Star Wars Celebration 2025.

"GameStop Has MicroSD Express Cards Up for Preorder, Just in Time for the Switch 2",2025-04-04T14:29:47Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/gamestop-has-microsd-express-cards-up-for-preorder,"It's official: TheNintendo Switch 2is coming very soon.June 5, to be exact! Following a lengthyNintendo Directthat showed off new games for the highly-anticipated console alongside more information on the Switch 2 hardware itself, some items are starting to go up for preorder. This includesmicroSD Express cards, which are the only storage cards theSwitch 2 will be compatible with.

Quite a few of these cards have already started to sell out, but there's a shining light at the end of the tunnel coming from GameStop. The retailer has created its own line of microSD Express cards that are available to preorder and come in varying capacities, from 256GB ($49.99) to 512GB ($84.99) to 1TB ($149.99). These are set to release on June 5, the same day as the console. You can preorder these cards below, but to stay up to date on more cards as they come back in stock keep ourhub page for microSD Express cardsbookmarked.
The microSD Express cards have been disappearing fast from online retailers, so if you've been hoping to secure a storage upgrade ahead of the Switch 2's release you'll want to be quick to get your preorders in. If you're unsure if you'll need the extra space, it's worth noting that the Switch 2 is set to come with256GB of internal storage, which is quite a bit more than the original Switch's 32GB. If you have an ever-expanding library of Switch games, it's always worth it to pick up some extra storage.
Outside of the additional storage, if you're curious when preorders will pop up for the console itself, make sure to mark your calendar for April 9. It's worth keeping ourSwitch 2 preorder guidebookmarked as well so you can stay up to date on when it drops and where it's available to purchase on the day. We've also put together a list full of tips tohelp increase your chances of getting a Switch 2. The countdown has begun, and we're here to help you secure a Switch 2 on day one.

The Midnight Switch 2 Launch at Best Buy Feels Like a Forgotten Era,2025-04-04T00:02:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-nintendo-switch-2-launch-time,"We live in an era of getting things shipped straight to your home, without needing to leave your house. Pretty much anything I could ever want can be sent directly to me in seemingly no time flat. It's an incredible thing, and yet part of me still yearns for the experience of getting something in person. It feels like it's more of an actual event and a memory you'll have forever.

With theNintendo Switch 2 preordersstarting soon, Best Buyhas announcedthat customers will have the option to pick up the new console at their local store at the stroke of midnight EST. It's the earliest possible time fans can get their hands on the Switch 2, withWalmart offering free deliveriesbefore 9 a.m. on June 5. While having it shipped directly to me would be the easiest path, the idea of actually going somewhere to secure the console with my own two hands appeals to me a lot more. If I do end up getting a preorder for the Switch 2, I'm going to choose to wait in line and make a big deal out of it.
Editor's Note: Due to tariffs in the U.S.,Switch 2 preorders have been delayedat Best Buy.
Best Buy preorders for the Switch 2 console, Switch 2 games, and its accessoriesbegin on Wednesday, April 9. If you're able to secure a console before stock disappears, you'll be able to choose preorder pickup at your local Best Buy location. You cansign up to get notificationsdirectly from Best Buy about all things Switch 2. Best Buy stated that most stores will be open at midnight ET on launch day‚Äî June 5‚Äî for pickup.
You can always use Google Maps to find your local Best Buy, but you can also use the tech retailer'sstore locater pageto find all locations in your surrounding area. You can widen the range of your search by simply expanding the map and see if the closest store is actually worth the drive.
In case you aren't familiar with Best Buy's memberships, there are a total of three. There's the free My Best Buy membership (which you'll need to preorder), My Best Buy Plus, and My Best Buy Total. Only the Plus and Total memberships are offering rewards for Nintendo purchases, but the rewards themselves are worth considering. You'll get a $20 certificate for every $150 you spend on Nintendo games and gear.
This sounds great in theory, if the Switch 2 itself was a qualifying purchase, but thefine print of the offer statesthat all Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 hardware is disqualified. With the price of someNintendo Switch 2 gamessitting at $80, though, you could easily spend over $150 with just two new game preorders.

Lego Reveals $170 Mario Kart Set Specifically Designed for Adult Builders,2025-03-10T14:40:01Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-reveals-170-mario-kart-set-specifically-designed-for-adult-builders,"It's Mario's big day, and Nintendo's plumber is getting a new Lego set with quite a few pieces in the box. Lego has revealed a new Mario Kart Lego set today, March 10, with almost 2,000 pieces and an ""18+"" age recommendation, arriving on May 15, 2025. It's available topreorder now at the LEGO Store.

Originally spottedpopping up on some store listings, Lego has officially unveiled the set, which includes both Mario and his Standard Kart from the Mario Kart series. It's a detailed model, meant for display and decor, with a special stand meant to showcase Mario and his kart at various angles.
OnLego's site, the company clocks the Mario Kart build at 1,972 pieces with a recommended ""18+"" Ages rating. This is due to the complexity of the build, it seems, and the intention of the product versus sets meant for play. ""This building kit is part of a large assortment of LEGO Sets for Adults designed for people who enjoy hands-on creative activities to relax,"" Lego said in its description.
Here we go! üèÜ Launching May 15th üèÅ#LEGOSuperMario#MarioKartpic.twitter.com/NZ13sCIFHo
The tenor of this build certainly seems aimed at the older, ""advanced"" builder of Lego. It also works with the Lego Builder app, which offers in-app building instructions and tools that let builders zoom and rotate around a 3D image of the model as they build. The final result is a posable, Lego-made Mario in his Kart.
Lego and Mario have built up a solid relationship over the years, with the collaboration resulting in numerous crossover sets. There's the Lego Super Mario line, which erred more on the side of interactive play andincorporated some game elements into its set design.
Still, some other options were aimed more at the older crowd who might like to build for relaxation and display over interactivity, likethe Pirahna Plantandthe Lego Super Mario World set featuring Mario and Yoshi. Some offer activities for the kids, while others offer nostalgia and complex builds for the adults.
The Lego Mario Kart build is up for pre-order now, at a price point of $169.99 / ¬£139.99 / ‚Ç¨169.99. The set will fully launch on May 15, 2025.

"Palworld Update 0.5.0 Adds Crossplay Across All Platforms, Blueprint Upgrading, Photo Mode and More",2025-03-19T09:25:58Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-update-050-adds-crossplay-across-all-platforms-blueprint-upgrading-photo-mode-and-more,"Palworldhas a big new update that adds crossplay across all platforms among many other new features.

Update v0.5.0 also lets players store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds. A new storage system has 10 times the capacity of the regular Palbox. Not only can guild members access it, but it can be used as a personal storage with private settings.
Elsewhere, you can now change your character‚Äôs appearance without affecting armor stats (transmog), there‚Äôs a photo mode, blueprint upgrading, and dedicated servers for Mac, among other changes detailed in the patch notes below.
Developer Pocketpair said it‚Äôs working on adding dedicated servers for the PlayStation 5 version and will release them at some point in the future.
Palworld has had an incredible32 million playerssince its early access launch in January 2024. The studio haslaid out a content roadmap for Palworld's 2025that looks fairly lengthy; alongside crossplay, there is an ""ending scenario"" and more new content on the way for the hugely popular creature-catching survival game.
Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC a year ago, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developercouldn‚Äôt handle the massive profits the game generated. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld‚Äôs breakout success,signing a deal with Sonyto form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that‚Äôs tasked with expanding the IP, and launching the game on PS5.
Looming over all this isa lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company, who seek ""an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages"" on the grounds that Palworld has allegedly infringed on ""multiple"" patent rights.Pocketpair has provided an update, identifying the patents the studio is allegedly infringing, and it has since tweaked how players summon Pals in Palworld, apparently in response. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company in court, saying: ‚ÄúWe will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.‚Äù

"Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Drops to Lowest Price Ever, and Even Beats Its Black Friday Discount",2025-03-24T09:46:40Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-drops-to-lowest-price-ever-2025,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirthis now available at its lowest price so far.Woot is offering the game for $32.99for PS5, a significant drop from its regular price of $69.99. For those who have been waiting to pick it up, this is a great opportunity to do so at a significant discount, and potentially one of the best deals of the year.

It's hard to imagine the game dropping any further in price anytime soon, making this likely the best opportunity to buy it at the lowest price possible in 2025. With such a steep discount, I wouldn't be surprising if it sells out quickly, so if you're interested in picking it up, don't wait too long.
In our 9/10 review, Michael Higham called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth‚Äúa best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth,‚Äù and ‚Äúan awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long.‚Äù While it takes some creative liberties in reimagining the classic, he described it as ‚Äúthrilling and unexpectedly impactful.‚Äù
Woot, an Amazon-owned online retailer, is known for offering limited-time deals on video games, tech, and more. It's a trusted source for deep discounts, and one we frequently recommend on IGN for finding some of the best gaming bargains around.

Nintendo Unveils Virtual Game Card Update Ahead of Switch 2 Launch,2025-03-27T14:41:20Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-card-update-ahead-of-switch-2-launch,"Nintendo is updating how digital Nintendo Switch games work with what it‚Äôs calling Virtual Game Cards ahead of the impending launch of Nintendo Switch 2.

The company explored how Virtual Game Cards will have players rethinking their purchases during today‚ÄôsMarch 2025 Nintendo Direct. We‚Äôll surely have a better understanding of this feature update when it rolls out with a system update in late April, but for now, it appears digital Switch games will now be more clear about where they‚Äôre allowed to be played and who you can play them with.
The idea is that Virtual Game Cards allow players to link two of their Switch consoles together and transfer their games between them. If you buy Super Mario Odyssey digitally on your original Switch, for example, it sounds like you'll be free to bring it over to another Switch family device with little to no issue (after the consoles are first paired). Managing your digital Virtual Game Card library can be done on a separate page that connects your consoles together, and it seems choosing where you're playing your games is simple.
Adding to the newfound functionality is a very Nintendo take on what many players refer to as game sharing. The company says you'll be able to ""lend out"" your purchased games to other members of your Family Group. It's a feature that gives gamers the freedom to choose one game, one of up to eight of their group members, and let them borrow that game for up to two weeks. A single game can only be shared with one member at a time, and it appears you'll lose access to your game for that period, but it is a streamlined way to let friends and family try out some of your favorite titles.
The headline here is that Nintendo wants Virtual Game Cards to be ‚Äúas flexible and convenient‚Äù as physical game cartridges. Digital game owners will be free to move their titles not only between another Switch device but, for a limited time, with friends as well. It's unclear how exactly Virtual Game Cards will work with Nintendo Switch 2, specifically, but it's clear the feature was made with the upcoming sequel console in mind.
We'll hopefully learn more about how Virtual Game Cards might work whenthe Switch 2 Direct premieres next week. For everything else revealed during today's March 2025 Nintendo Direct, you can see everything else announcedhere.

"The Best Deals Today: Cheap iPad, Asus Chromebook, Samsung SSDs, Power Banks, and More",2025-03-11T17:55:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-march-11-2025,"Here are the best deals for Tuesday, March 11. HIghlights include rare discounts on PS5 Dualsense controllers from Lenovo, an Asus Chromebook for just over $100 from Best Buy, the coveted AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D back in stock on Amazon at a non marked-up price, big savings on speedy Samsung SSDs, power banks for your handheld gaming PCs, and more.

Lenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.
Last year the 9th generation iPad was the least expensive iPad you could get brand new and with warranty. It was regularly priced at $179, but it went out of stock pretty much everywhere starting from Black Friday. Fortunately, it's back for one final harrah; right now, Walmart has it available for delivery for only $179 shipped. Seriously though, this deal probably won't last much longer so don't hesitate.
Amazon is offering this Iniu 20,000mAh 65W USB Power Bank for only $21.59 after you clip the 40% off coupon on the product page (if you don't see it, try applying promo code ""WN9GQJRA""). This is a great price for a high-capacity power bank that can deliver more power than other power banks at the same price point. The 65W of power delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, and iPhone 16 at their fastest rates.
4TB for $259.99
Samsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.
If you're in the process of building out a new gaming PC and you're looking for the best gaming processor, this is it. Right now, the recently releasedAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DAM5 desktop processor is back in stock on Amazon and Best Buy at its retail price of $479 shipped. This is the official launch price with zero markup, and it's not bundled with anything you don't want or need. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming processor currently on the market (across both AMD and Intel) and a better choice for gamers than the more expensiveIntel Core Ultra 9 285K.
AMD's new Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards have been released, but just like their Nvidia counterparts, they're mostly out of stock and impossible to find at retail pricing. Don't fret, however, because you can still get these GPUs equipped in a prebuilt gaming PC for a reasonable price. The Radeon RX 9070 GPUs are the new mid-range champions of this generation. Both cards offer phenomenal performance while undercutting their Nvidia competition.
Apple's best earbuds are on sale today. Amazon is offering the second generationApple AirPods Prowireless noise-canceling earbuds for only $169.99 shipped, a savings of 32% and the best AirPods deal so far this year. That's about $20 more than theApple AirPods 4 with ANC, down from its usual $70 price premium. Between the two, the AirPods Pro is stillthe superior earbudsbecause it offers better sound quality and noise cancelation.
Chromebooks aren't exactly gaming-minded PCs, but they're compact, lightweight, great for productivity on the go, and in this case, a bargain. As part of Best Buy's Deal of the Day, you can pick up thisAsus 14"" Chromebookfor just $119 shipped after a $180 off instant discount, although I'd say the MSRP is a tad inflated. Even so, that's still a fantastic deal for a chromebook that features a relatively recent 8-core MediaTek processor which pairs well with Google Chrome OS.
You can grab this 10,000mAh power bank for only $8.99 after you clip the 10% off and 40% off clippable coupons on the product page. We very rarely see 10,000mAh power banks listed for under $10 so grab this one while you can. This will charge a Nintendo Switch from 0% to 100% about 1.9 times.
For a limited time, Hulu is offering four months of Disney+ and Hulu Basic (Ad-Supported) Bundle for just $2.99 per month. The normal cost of this subscription is $10.99 per month. This deal only comes around a handful of times per year and worth it for just the Disney+ subscription alone.
Pick up a five pack of USB Type-C cables for a grand total of just $7.96 after you apply promo code ""UNWEXMFD"". That averages out to about $1.59 per cable. Lengths include two 3.3ft, two 6.6ft, and an extra long 10ft cable. They're all rated for up to 60W of USB Power Delivery and are encased in a durable braided nylon sheath.
If you're searching for your next new game to play,Humble Choice Marchis now live, and this is the perfect bundle to discover something new! This month, Homeworld 3 headlines the bundle, with other PC games like Wild Hearts, Pacific Drive, Zau, and Gravity Circuit also included. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars to grab these games individually, you can get all eight games for just $11.99 at Humble Bundle for this month only.

Nintendo Today App Unveiled as News and Content Hub for Dedicated Fans,2025-03-27T15:26:13Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-today-app-unveiled-as-news-and-content-hub-for-dedicated-fans,"Nintendo Today is a new app from the Super Mario Bros. company itself that aims to bring Nintendo news to players a bit more directly than ever before.

Video game legend Shigeru Miyamoto spilled the beans on the company‚Äôs latest news push as a last-minute stinger during today‚ÄôsMarch 2025 Nintendo Direct. This all-in-one phone application is available to download via the Apple App Store and Google Play today and comes with a variety of perks for die-hard Nintendo fans to be aware of.
This hub for all things Nintendo serves as a daily calendar and news machine to drip feed information directly to players as it happens. Miyamoto uses the example that, after the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct premieres next week, fans will be able to log into the Nintendo Today app to catch all of the updates, with more news arriving ‚Äúdaily‚Äù from there.
It‚Äôs a bit more direct than the average Nintendo Direct and encourages fans to keep up to date with news, even if there‚Äôs not a massive announcement to be made. As days roll on, you‚Äôll see characters from Mario, Pikmin, Animal Crossing, and more show up to welcome you to a new day. The feed will also be updated not only with news but Nintendo-themed content, too. Highlights shown during the Nintendo Direct include a Pikmin 4 comic called ‚ÄúToo Stuck to Pluck‚Äù and Pearls of Wisdom from Animal Crossing‚Äôs resident shell-cracking Otter, Pascal.
Nintendo Today isn‚Äôt quite the Zelda or Super Smash Bros. bombshell many fans hoped to see round out today‚Äôs Direct, but it‚Äôs at least another channel for fans to tune into. For more onMetroid,Pok√©mon, and everything else announced during today‚Äôs March 2025 Nintendo Direct, you can click righthere.

Nintendo Fine Print Reveals 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition' Games and Fans Are Trying to Work Out What That Means,2025-03-27T21:40:23Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fine-print-reveals-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-and-fans-are-trying-to-work-out-what-that-means,"Today's Nintendo Direct announcement of anew Virtual Game Cards feature for sharing games between systemsis being met with surprise and interest from fans. But it's also raising some questions, most notably one about the Nintendo Switch 2, thanks to a fine print footnote on an official Nintendo webpage.

The question comes fromthis page, which explains how Virtual Game Cards work. Most of what's here is fairly straightforward (well, as straightforward as anything is). But there's a fascinating footnote at the bottom of the page, tied to the feature of moving games between Switch systems. It reads:
What's throwing people here is the phrasing ""Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games."" The part about ""exclusive games"" is straightforward enough, as we already knew there would be games that are only playable on the Nintendo Switch 2, and not the current Switch. But we also know thatthe Nintendo Switch 2 is backwards compatible with Switch 1(mostly). So what is a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition game?
Some fans are suggestingthis is a subtle confirmationthatthere will be some ""enhanced editions""of existing Switch games that add new features or improved performance, only for Switch 2. If that's the case, it would make sense that purchasing them on Switch 2 would not allow them to be shared with a Switch 1, because they simply wouldn't function correctly and would effectively be a different edition of the version on Switch 1.
That's not the only theory though. Some others are speculating that this doesn't confirm anything, merely suggests an unfortunate situation where users won't be able to use Nintendo's shiny new Virtual Game Card feature to send some or all Nintendo Switch 2 games backward to Switch 1, even if they're the same game. It's also possible this doesn't suggest anything in particular, but merely opens the door in the future for third-parties to release Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of games if they feel like it.
We reached out to Nintendo to try to get a clarification, but were told by a spokesperson they would have an answer for us on April 2,conveniently the day of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. Just hang in there a little bit longer, everyone.

My First Adult LEGO Purchase Was This Mario Set and I Have No Regrets,2025-03-07T23:15:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/my-first-adult-lego-purchase-was-this-mario-set-and-i-have-no-regrets,"In general, I am a very practical person when it comes to spending money. I buy the essentials I need and occasionally a video game when it goes on sale, but usually I don't really venture beyond that. It wasn't until just last year that I even considered buying something as unnecessary as a LEGO set. Even though I loved building LEGO sets as a kid, at some point I guess I just got older and stopped.

In part, that's probably becauseLEGO is really expensive. While there are some cool sets for under $25, anything tied to some sort of movie or video game franchise always comes at a higher cost. Which is why it took me so long to convince myself to buy the LEGO Super Mario Piranha Plant. It'sbeen on sale since October of last yearfor under $50 but I only recently decided my desk needed a new potted plant.
I first started considering this set after reading throughIGN's build of the Piranha Plant. I have been a fan of pretty muchevery Mario gamethere's been so far, and this set just seemed like the perfect way to display my love of the franchise. LEGO has a lot offlower sets in its botanical linethat would look great on my desk too, but none of them are as whimsically terrifying as this little guy.
Now that I've actually built the set, I am really happy to have it on my desk. Every time I look at it I can imagine that I'm somewhere in the Mushroom Kingdom with my little potted Piranha Plant I've been cultivating during work hours. And while I love the end result of the set, I enjoyed building it just as much. I was able to put it together in one afternoon, but it was still challenging enough to hold my attention the entire time. It's currently the onlyLEGO Nintendo setI own, but I'm definitely considering adding more alongside it after my experience.
Like I mentioned above, the world of LEGO is an expensive one. With the company releasing newsets targeted at adultsevery year with price tags of $200 or more, it can be tempting to spend way too much on something awesome. Unless you're made of money, there's a fine line between treating yourself to something you love and bankrupting yourself in an avalanche of plastic bricks.
The fact that this Mario LEGO set was under $50 was enough for me to feel good about buying it for myself. I got to spend hours building it and seeing it sitting next to me brings me a little bit of happiness each day. Is that little bit of happiness worth more than $50? Probably. But that's just how much I'm willing to spend.

While it might not have the same hype as Black Friday or Prime Day, the discounts speak for themselves, and there's so many great offers to choose from still‚Äî including the lowest prices of the year on tech like Apple AirPods, Kindles, Fire TV Sticks, and must-have items like50 series GPUs, andPok√©mon TCG cardsback in stock for a limited time.

Amazon‚Äôs dedicatedSpring Sale hub has plenty of deals, but we‚Äôve done the heavy lifting for you on the final day of the sale, highlighting only the best discountsactuallyworth your time. Every deal we feature is either at its lowest-ever price, matches its best price of the year so far, or is so hotly sought after we can't help but mention it. We‚Äôre keeping this list fresh with real-time updates, so you won‚Äôt miss out on the biggest savings before the sale ends.
There are already some incredible doorbuster deals in the Amazon Spring Sale 2025. One of the best is theINIU 10K power bank for just $9with code S7LY7824 and clipping the 50% coupon ‚Äì a record low price. It‚Äôs an absolute must-buy, especially for iPhone users, but even beyond that, it‚Äôs just anoutstanding power bankat an unbeatable price. If you grab only one thing from this sale, make it this. You can findmore coupons worth clippingto score additional savings on books, robot vacuums and more.
Other tech deals include the standard slate ofApple products, likeAirPodsand thenewest Apple Watch, as well as Amazon devices likeFire TV.
It'd be silly not to mention thelatest round of Pok√©mon TCG stock at Amazonduring the sale, with elusive Elite Trainer Boxes like Twilight Masquerade available again, alongside a slew of other hot booster sets likeSurging Sparks.
One of our favorite deals during theSpring Sale is The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Editions, all at all time low discounts, and in thebuy two get one freedeal. It's one of the best offers we've seen all year.Sunrise on the Reaping, the new Hunger Games novel, should also be on your radar.
Other books in the sale include chart-topper Onyx Storm, and its fellow Empyrean series booksIron FlameandFourth Wing, alongside theHarry Potter Illustrated Books.
For just individual book deals, we also love theSkyrim Library, a three-volume collection of texts, now down to just$49.99 when clipping the coupon at Amazon. A gloriously good deal for a magnificent set of books. We've also seen plenty ofcomics, likeUltimate Spider-Man, and even select vinyl (also within the 3 for 2 promotion) included in the deals.
LEGO sets are getting more expensive, but they always seem to get solid discounts during these types of sales. Some of thebest LEGO dealsfrom the current sale include discounts on theLEGO Wednesday collaborationas well as some very cozyLEGO Animal Crossing sets. Some of ourfavorite board gamesfor both families and adults are included in the sale. We've also seen tons of deals on 90's comebacks includingaction figures,plushies,Nerf gunsand evenBop It! toys(that apparently still exist).
Amazon has also discounted tons ofindividual movies and TV shows, includingold-school Warner Bros. cartoonsandfilms directed by David Lynch.
It's always the right time to get accessories you actually need, but it's even better to get them on sale. That said, Amazon has discounts on variousPS Portal accessory deals. My other favorites that are worth considering includeAudible Premium Plus for $0.99, theApple AirPods Pro 2 for $169.99,Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth for $32.99, and65"" LG C4 4K OLED Smart TV for $1,397.
The Amazon Spring Sale (March 25-31) couldn‚Äôt come at a better time. With no major shopping holidays between now and Memorial Day, this is one of the best opportunities to score great deals before summer. WhilePrime DayandBlack Fridaymight bring even steeper discounts, those are months away ‚Äì if you‚Äôre looking to save right now, this sale is your best bet.
That said, strategic shopping always wins. If you‚Äôre eyeing a big-ticket item like aTVorKindlebut don‚Äôt need it immediately, waiting for a larger sale could be worth it. Want to make sure you‚Äôre getting the best possible price? Tools likeCamelCamelCamellet you track pricing history, helping you spot real deals from the ones that justlookgood. It‚Äôs a trick we swear by to make sure every recommendation is truly worth your money.

Deals For Today: Amazon International Solves Pok√©mon TCG Shortage With Massive Restocks,2025-03-21T15:45:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-march-21-2025,"I didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd see a proper Pok√©mon TCG restock this early in 2025. Honestly, I was betting on summer at best, but here we are with actual product showing up on Amazon and not behind some sketchy paywalled Discord server. While the internet‚Äôs currently losing its mind over Prismatic Evolutions and burning money chasing stock alerts for Rival Destinies, the smart play is scooping up the older sets that just hit Amazon Global. We‚Äôre talking Scarlet and Violet era stuff, Sword and Shield throwbacks, and boxes that were basically extinct six months ago.

This is the kind of flood the TCG community needed. Not just for collectors trying to complete sets, but for anyone who‚Äôs tired of battling bots for ETBs like it‚Äôs the Hunger Games. There‚Äôs a real mix available right now: Booster Bundles, Premium Collections, tins with actual storage value. And yes, even a few deals that make it feel like Amazon‚Äôs trying to keep the vibe positive. If you‚Äôre chasing big pulls like Greninja SIR or Pikachu ex SIR, or just need to stock up on sleeves and dice, this is the best stock refreshes we‚Äôve seen in a while.
AliExpress is currently offering theSony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphonesfor only $225.18 after coupon code:IFP7FJZis applied during checkout. This product is stocked in a US warehouse, so it ships free and arrives within about a week. This is an import model with a warranty that won't be honored in the United States. AliExpress makes up for it with a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days.
In our glowingSony WH1000XM5 review, Kevin Lee wrote that ""The Sony WH-1000XM5 is hands down the best sounding and most impressive noise-canceling headphones around. They demand a high premium but the cost of audio excellence is well worth it with this pair of headphones.""
The real deal here is the fact that theTwilight MasqueradeElite Trainer Box is actually in stock. Seeing it available without a 200% markup or sketchy third-party seller feels borderline miraculous. You‚Äôre getting nine booster packs, a full-art Teal Mask Ogerpon promo, and all the usual ETB goodies like energy cards, condition markers, and themed sleeves.
It‚Äôs not every day you seeBrilliant StarsBuild and Battle Boxes in stock, let alone without having to navigate the wild west of resale sites. At $63.34, this one comes with four booster packs and a pre-release promo card, which makes it a solid pickup for collectors looking to flesh out their Sword and Shield era sets. Arceus VSTAR headlines the expansion, and the pull potential here still holds up.
Among Us 4-Pack on Steam is a sneaky little deal that gives you four copies of the game for the price of one, making it dangerously easy to rope your friends into a night of trust issues and vent-related betrayal. It supports cross-platform play, customizable settings, and chaotic emergency meetings that usually end with the wrong person getting ejected. If you‚Äôve somehow missed the social deduction chaos, now‚Äôs the perfect time to catch up and take three crewmates down with you.
TheHisuian Electrode V Boxis back in stock at Amazon for $42.45, which is a win considering how sporadically these pop up. It's one of those V boxes that slipped under the radar when it first launched, but now that Sword and Shield-era product is drying up it‚Äôs worth grabbing. You get a foil Hisuian Electrode V promo, a regular Electrode foil, an oversized version (because why not), and four booster packs to rip through.
This limited-edition snack box is a flavor-packed tribute toAssassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows, blending premium Japanese treats with collectible game merch in a way that feels like an edible side quest. You get 15 unique snacks, a full bag of exclusive Kit Kats, a custom Tenugui towel, and even an in-game item called The Hourglass that‚Äôs only available through this box. With artwork prints, a detailed snack guide, and a box sleeve that transforms into a display-worthy poster, it‚Äôs more than just snacks.
Seeing theShining FatesPikachu V Box on Amazon again feels like spotting a shiny in the wild. At $49.96 it‚Äôs not exactly a steal, but having it in stock is the real value. This box comes with a foil Pikachu V promo, an oversized version for flair, and four Shining Fates booster packs. That means a legit shot at pulls from one of the most hype-filled sets of the Sword and Shield era.
TheSurging SparksBooster Bundle is actually in stock at Amazon for $47.95, which is kind of a miracle considering how fast this set‚Äôs been disappearing. You get six booster packs from the newest Scarlet and Violet expansion, which includes some major chase cards like Pikachu ex SIR and Latias ex. If you missed the chaos of launch day or couldn‚Äôt snag a bundle without battling bots, this is your chance to catch up.
I want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark‚Äôs lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I‚Äôd never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won‚Äôt see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it‚Äôs still expensive, but honestly, it‚Äôs worth it if you want peak immersion.
This phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.
I can‚Äôt think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It‚Äôs fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung‚Äôs 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there‚Äôs a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.
RimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it‚Äôll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it‚Äôs 3 a.m. and you‚Äôre emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one‚Äôs worth every penny.
This SSD is built like a tank. It‚Äôs water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it‚Äôs fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won‚Äôt fail you, this is a solid choice.
I never thought I‚Äôd be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It‚Äôs like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it‚Äôs futuristic, and at $272 off, it‚Äôs almost a steal. Almost.
I think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren‚Äôt using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you‚Äôre signing important contracts.
Apple‚Äôs best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you‚Äôve been eyeing Apple‚Äôs top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we‚Äôre talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you‚Äôre blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don‚Äôt have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.
The games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art. The remastered soundtracks, modernized UI, and quality-of-life improvements bring these classics into the modern age while keeping their original charm intact. Each game features iconic character designs by Kazuko Shibuya and a faithful soundtrack rearranged by Nobuo Uematsu. Whether you‚Äôre reliving the golden age of RPGs or playing them for the first time, this bundle is the ultimate way to experience Final Fantasy‚Äôs roots. The limited-time sale price of $52.49, down from $74.99, makes this an easy win for any RPG fan.

A genuine Apple leather case for $11.99? That‚Äôs not a typo. It‚Äôs an 80% discount. Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It‚Äôs slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you‚Äôve been holding off on upgrading your case, now‚Äôs the time before Apple realizes what they‚Äôve done.
If you‚Äôre tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that‚Äôs actually worth every penny.
Why buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it‚Äôs discounted.
If you‚Äôre serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it‚Äôs a must-have.
Still using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you‚Äôre sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.
These aren‚Äôt just Beats. They‚Äôre sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They‚Äôve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple‚Äôs H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won‚Äôt budge during workouts.
These Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They‚Äôre currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.
Luxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it‚Äôll hold up for years. Normally $149, it‚Äôs now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that‚Äôs actually worth jumping on.
This isn‚Äôt your average watch band. Apple‚Äôs Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It‚Äôs made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that‚Äôs 68% recycled, so you‚Äôre doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it‚Äôs a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.
For those who prefer their Pok√©mon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says ""powerful Pok√©mon"" like an angry robot penguin).
I'm so happy to see this in stock. You‚Äôll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon‚Äôs Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.
If somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you‚Äôve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.
Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you‚Äôre not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).
If you‚Äôve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, ""I really need to delete some games,"" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you‚Äôll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It‚Äôs lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won‚Äôt be frantically searching for a charging cable.
Samsung‚ÄôsQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room. The Acoustic Lens Subwoofer ensures deep, punchy bass, while Adaptive Sound and Game Mode Pro make sure everything from dialogue to explosions sounds crisp. At $764 off, this is the cheapest we‚Äôve seen it outside of Black Friday.
LG B4 OLED TVbrings incredible picture quality at a price that doesn‚Äôt require selling a kidney. It features Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, an Œ±8 AI Processor that automatically enhances whatever you‚Äôre watching, and LG‚Äôs latest webOS for easy access to streaming apps and over 300 free LG Channels. Gamers get Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and VRR, plus four HDMI 2.1 ports. At $499.99, this is one of the best deals for an OLED right now.
Samsung‚Äôs S90D OLED TVis a beast, packing AI-powered 4K upscaling, Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for silky smooth gameplay, and Dolby Atmos for immersive sound. Real Depth Enhancer makes everything look more lifelike, and PANTONE validation ensures accurate color reproduction. At $300 off, this is a great price for a high-end 65‚Äù OLED TV.
Sony‚Äôs WH-CH520 headphonesoffer 50 hours of battery life, customizable sound settings, and a lightweight, comfortable design. Multipoint connection makes switching between devices seamless, and DSEE upscaling improves compressed audio. At just $35.95, these are one of the best budget wireless headphones out there today.
Google‚Äôs Pixel Buds Pro 2 bring top-tier noise cancellation, a Tensor A1 chip for AI-powered audio enhancements, and large 11mm drivers for rich bass. Conversation Detection automatically switches to transparency mode when you talk, so you don‚Äôt have to take them out. If you need premium wireless earbuds, this is asolid deal for these 9/10 buds.
Enshrouded is a survival RPG with deep crafting, intense combat, and massive co-op potential. Play solo or team up with up to 16 friends, build custom bases, and fight through a dark, mysterious world. It‚Äôs still in early access, but at $23.99, it‚Äôs worth jumping in now aswe gave it 8/10.

Nintendo Switch 2's New GameShare Feature Lets You Temporarily Play Your Games With Other People,2025-04-02T13:35:37Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-new-gameshare-feature-lets-you-temporarily-play-your-games-with-other-people,"Nintendo Switch 2 includes an all-new GameShare feature.

FCC Filing Could Indicate a Possible Upgrade For Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller,2025-04-01T14:13:28Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/fcc-filing-could-indicate-a-possible-upgrade-for-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller,"It's the day before theNintendo Switch 2 Direct, with less than 24 hours to go until Nintendo reveals its plans for its next console. A new Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filing could, potentially, point to some of those plans, at least when it comes to its Switch 2 controller lineup.

As spotted onFamiboardsand picked up by Nintendo-centric sites likeGoNintendo, an FCC filing emerged yesterday, March 31, from Nintendo. Under product code ""BEE-008,"" it looks to be a registration for a new game controller. Some fans believe this to be the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.
It bears mentioning that this is speculaton, as Nintendo hasn't confirmed plans for a Switch 2 Pro Controller yet. However, a few features do seem to indicate this would be a Pro Controller, like Bluetooth and NFC capability.
The big thing to note about this filing, if this is the Switch 2 Pro Controller, is that it could include a headphone jack. The original Switch 1 Pro Controller didn't have a headphone jack of any kind, while controllers like the DualSense and Xbox Series controllers do feature a port.
This would be a nice quality-of-life feature, if this holds true for the Switch 2 Pro Controller.Past Nintendo filingshave given us a glimpse of the company's plans in advance, so there's some reason to entertain speculation about this controller. We've yet to see it though, so barring any more leaks between now and tomorrow, we'll likely have confirmation once Nintendo announces its full plans for the Switch 2.
The Switch 2 Directairs tomorrow at 6am PT / 9am ET on Nintendo's channels. We'll be getting a ""closer look"" at the Switch 2, after its initial reveal earlier this year, and hopefully a lot of solid information leading up to a potential release date.
Nintendo has confirmed the Switch 2 Direct will run for an hour. Two Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2 presentations with hands-on gameplay have been scheduled for April 3 and April 4 as well, starting at 7am PT each day.

Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Announced for Nintendo Switch,2025-03-27T14:44:05Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-announced-for-nintendo-switch,"Today's Nintendo Direct ended in a surprising and rather strange way, with the announcement of a brand new Tomodachi Life game after over a decade-long hiatus for the series. It's calledTomodachi Life: Living the Dreamand it's not coming out until 2026.

The original Tomodachi Life was first released back in 2013 in Japan and 2014 overseas, and is a social sim game featuring Nintendo's Mii characters. Both in the original and now in Living the Dream, the Miis live in a small community together, and players are able to have Miis with different personalities and stats interact with one another. Over time, the Miis can form different kinds of relationships with one another, and watch their lives evolve through different activities. Miis can even get married and have kids.
From the trailer we saw, it looks like Living the Dream will feature a lot of the same things. We see Miis playing games together, dancing, smelling flowers, fighting one another, exercising, sleeping, shopping, and chatting in that goofy, bizarre robot voice way that they do. We don't have too many details on how Living the Dream will move the series forward, though it does look significantly prettier than its 3DS predecessor.
Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream won't be out until 2026, so we'll have to wait for more details on what it entails between now and then. For more, check outeverything announced at Nintendo Direct March 2025.

"MAR10 Day 2025: Mario Kart Lego Set, Nintendo Music Additions, and Everything Announced",2025-03-10T16:26:47Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/mar10-day-2025-mario-kart-lego-set-nintendo-music-additions-and-everything-announced,"It‚Äôs March 10, 2025, so that means Nintendo is back with a slew of Mario Day reveals revolving around everyone‚Äôs favorite Mushroom Kingdom mascot.

As highlighted by the MAR10 hashtag floating around social media today, March 10 has served as Nintendo‚Äôs official (and clever) Mario holiday for the last few years. The appropriately named celebration always features announcements and treats for fans of the iconic plumber, and this year is no different. Although we‚Äôve not yet seen anything quite on the level of2024‚Äôs reveals, which included the promise thatThe Super Mario Bros. Movie 2 will arrive next year, 2025 has already delivered some exciting Mario news.
Just hours before MAR10 Day officially kicked off, Nintendo announced that the Super Mario Bros. 3 original soundtrack had been added to its Nintendo Music application for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. That means earworms like the World 1 Map tune Ground BGM are only a tap away, but there are even more deal sweeteners now available for Mario fans. Last Thursday, as an early surprise, Nintendo added the Game Boy releases of Mario‚Äôs Picross and Donkey to its library of Switch Online titles. It‚Äôs all available to help make MAR10 Day feel a bit more special right now.
Here we go! üèÜ Launching May 15th üèÅ#LEGOSuperMario#MarioKartpic.twitter.com/NZ13sCIFHo
Nintendo hasn‚Äôt been shy when it comes to adding more Lego sets based on its iconic cast of characters. While Mario has gotten plenty of love in this department in the past, thenew Mario Kart buildrevealed as part of today‚Äôs festivities might be one of the toy line‚Äôs coolest yet. It‚Äôll cost a whopping $170 when it drops May 15, 2025, but it also manages to pack in quite a bit of detail into the 1,972-piece kit.
If you‚Äôre looking for every way you could possibly celebrate Mario Day, this new sweepstakes has you covered. As seen on theMy Nintendo website, Nintendo account holders can now spend Platinum points to enter into a sweepstakes that will offer select users the chance to win a four-night stay at Universal Orlando Resort that includes access to each of its four theme parks. It‚Äôll come with the freedom to enjoy Super Nintendo World when its Orlando location opens this May.
JetBlue has partnered with Nintendo to create the Cloudtop Cruiser, a sky-blue aircraft featuring Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and Bowser that will be used to transport fans. If flights aren‚Äôt your thing, you can enjoy more from Mario Day by participating in a Mario Kart 8 Deluxe community challenge that gives players until March 17 to complete 1 million in-game laps, collectively. A reward of 310 Platinum points will be gifted to those who participate in the challenge.
Meanwhile, Mario fans located in New York can visit the Nintendo store from 1pm ‚Äì 4pm ET today to chat with Mario via an LED wall. Then, from 4pm ‚Äì 7pm ET, the same location will offer meet-and-greet opportunities with Mario and Luigi. Those who can‚Äôt make the trek to New York may still be in luck, as starting March 15 from 12pm ‚Äì 4pm. local time,select GameStop locationswill allow players to demo Nintendo Switch titles such as Super Mario Party Jamboree, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and more. The GameStop events will also include Nintendo-themed giveaways.
Another Mario Day tradition involves respectable discounts for some of the video game plumber's most iconic titles, and 2025 is no different. On the My Nintendo Store and eShop alone are a bevy of deals for games like Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Super Mario RPG, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, and more. You can see a list of a few of the MAR10 Day deals we spottedhere.
While die-hard Mario Bros. fans do what they can to celebrate Mario‚Äôs big day, others are simply taking the time to celebrate on social media. You‚Äôll be hard pressed to make it out of today without seeing enough fan creations to stop an army of Koopa Troopas in their tracks, but we‚Äôve gone through the trouble to include some of our favorites below.

Nintendo Fan Plans On Waiting in Line For Switch 2 At Nintendo New York For Next 2 Months,2025-04-07T14:49:03Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fan-plans-on-waiting-in-line-for-switch-2-at-nintendo-new-york-for-next-2-months,"Nintendo fans are presumably eager to get their hands on theNintendo Switch 2. But one in particular seems a bit more eager than most, as he's already starting the line in front of the Nintendo New York store two months in advance to ensure he gets one.

YouTuber ChickenDog has started making the rounds as the ""first"" person to line up for the Nintendo Switch 2 at the New York store location. He started on April 5, two months before the planned June 5 launch of the new Nintendo console, andhe said he plans to camp outand record updates as he does so.
First in line for the Nintendo Switch 2 gonna be camping out for 2 months can‚Äôt wait to see what happens throughout my journey!#NintendoSwitch2#NintendoNYC#nintendostoreuspic.twitter.com/Vb7wrmk52y
The ""camping out"" is a little more in the colloquial sense, as ChickenDogclarified in an update videothat he has an AirBnB and hotel, as well as friends in the area, so he won't be braving the elements for two straight months. He's also got a crew of friends helping him hold the spot down when he's not physically there.
It‚Äôs raining for day 3 staying strong üí™pic.twitter.com/lkFVycX2xW
There's certainly a history of Nintendo fans camping out for big console and game releases,including a month-long wait for the Nintendo Switch. It seems like ChickenDog is looking to follow in those footsteps, waiting out the two months for Switch 2.
The YouTuber plans on recording and uploading content while he's out there, so head over to ChickenDog's YouTube if you want to follow all the updates day-after-day. Even without a tent or sleeping bag, waiting out for two months is a long, long time, so best of luck and some sunny skies to him.
Assuming ChickenDog stays the course, he'll need to hand over $450 just for a Switch 2, or $500 if he wants the Mario Kart world bundle. That is, unless the price goes up in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have already caused Nintendo to delay Switch 2 pre-orders.

Netflix Says Kids Don't Care About Consoles: '8-Year-Olds Aren‚Äôt Dreaming of PlayStation 6',2025-03-28T18:05:18Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-says-kids-dont-care-about-consoles-8-year-olds-arent-dreaming-of-playstation-6,"Netflix's President of Games, Alain Tascan, is expecting a future generation that relies less on gaming consoles as major players like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo push forward with new hardware.

The lead of the streaming giant‚Äôs video game division shared his thoughts on how gaming fans might soon play their favorite titles during an interview withThe Game Businessthat took place following a Netflix presentation in San Francisco. During the event itself, Tascan was asked if the streamer had any intention of taking a crack at console gaming, but he‚Äôs not so sure younger gamers are even interested in what something like a PlayStation 6 could bring to the table.
‚Äú[When it comes to] console, we started to look at the future where the platform is agnostic,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúLook at the younger generation. Are eight year-olds and 10 year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6? I am not sure. They are wanting to interact with any digital screen, whatever it is, wherever it is, even in the car. With console you‚Äôre thinking about high definition, you‚Äôre thinking about the controller [‚Ä¶] If we look at this older model, I think it will restrain us.‚Äù
Tascan told The Game Business that he‚Äôs got a soft spot for console gaming despite his concerns, specifically calling out Nintendo‚Äôs Wii as a personal favorite. He‚Äôs spent many years at studios such as EA, Ubisoft, and Epic Games in the past, so the idea of more traditional console game releases is far from foreign for him. For Netflix, though, things are trending in a different direction.
While the company has a proven track record for creating game adaptations for its IPs with subscription add-ons like Stranger Things 3: The Game, Too Hot to Handle: Love Is a Game, and more, it‚Äôs also experimented with giving users access to notable, familiar games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas ‚Äì The Definitive Edition. Each game can be played straight from a mobile phone if a subscriber chooses, and as Tascan clarified during that recent event, Netflix will be doubling down on this strategy as it develops party games and establishes itself as a hub for kids and gamer families.
‚ÄúI am very vigorous about lowering friction and eliminating it if we can,‚Äù he told The Game Business. ‚ÄúI see that the subscription is friction as well. Maybe good friction because it makes business sense, but still we did the test of eliminating subscription for [mobile game] Squid Game: Unleashed. And we may do other tests.‚Äù
He continued: ‚ÄúBut the other friction is having enough controllers for family. Having a piece of hardware that might be expensive, that‚Äôs another friction. Waiting for a game to download, that‚Äôs another friction. I am [looking at] all the obstacles, and asking if we can reduce them as much as possible.‚Äù
Netflix said in early 2024 that games engagement had tripled throughout 2023, signaling that it would continue investing in the space in the future after a 2021CNBCreport suggestedless than 1% of subscribers were tapping into its gamesofferings. In October 2024, the streaming giant cut back on its gaming ambitions when itshut down its AAA studio headed by former Overwatch, Halo, and God of War developers. AGame Developerreport from last month said cuts had also recently hit Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, a teamNetflix picked up in 2021.
As Netflix seeks to tap into a market that it expects to be uninterested in game consoles, there‚Äôs little reason to doubt we‚Äôll see something like aPlayStation 6ornext Xboxfrom Sony and Microsoft, respectively. Nintendo, meanwhile, is teetering on the edge of a brand-new console generation with itshighly anticipated Switch 2 device. It will pull back the curtain on its new tech with a focused Direct presentation next week, with many fans expecting to hear more aboutwhat features the Switch 2 brings to the table, its release date, andhow pre-orders are being handled.

"Pokemon Legends: Z-A Gets New Trailer Showing Pokemon on Roofs, Late Night Trainer Battles",2025-03-27T14:29:27Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-new-trailer-showing-pokemon-on-roofs-late-night-trainer-battles,"During today's Nintendo Direct, we saw some new gameplay for Pokemon Legends: Z-A, which showed off more footage of wild Pokemon, including wild Pokemon hanging out on rooftops, and a mysterious nighttime tournament called the Z-A Royale.

In the trailer, we learned that wild Pokemon don't just appear within designated zones in the city, but can also appear outside of them, including on rooftops. So you may encounter wild Pokemon that you can capture or battle when you're just wandering around Lumiose City.
More importantly, we learned a bit more about the cryptic tease at the end of the last Z-A trailer. At night, Lumiose City's streets are flooded with trainers battling in a tournament called the ""Z-A Royale"". You begin in the tournament at rank Z, and work your way up to rank A, with the promise of having a ""wish granted"" if you succeed.
With this feature, we got a look at more trainer battles, including the ability to ""surprise attack"" other trainers from behind to get an advantage in battle.
Pokemon Legends: Z-A was first announced atlast year's Pokemon Presents, with a cinematic trailer showing off a futuristicLumiose City. At the time, we were given very few details: just that it would be coming to Nintendo Switch this year, and some light Pokemon teases. We have sincegotten a longer look at the gamein a Pokemon Direct earlier this year, including seeing many of the Pokemon that will be available, a number of new characters, and the protagonist running all over the rooftops.
Since then, fans have been piecing together little hints from the trailer and their own experiences withPokemon Legends: Arceusand its unique spin on the Pokemon formula. While we can expect Legends: Z-A to have some similarities with Arceus, we're hoping it's a little more polished than both it and Scarlet and Violet when it launches later this year.
You can catch up on everything fromtoday's Nintendo Direct right here.

"I've Found A Bunch Of Apple Deals For Today: Discounted Air Pods 2, Beats, Apple Pencils, AirTags And More",2025-03-19T16:30:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-march-19-2025,"Finding a good deal on Apple products is rough, which is why I focused on all of these daily deals today. Finding multiple Apple deals, plus discounts on Zelda and Final Fantasy collectibles? It's my gamer-tech jackpot. Right now, you can save onAirPods Pro 2, grab aMagSafe leather case for just $11.99, and even score afour-pack of AirTags for under $70.

If you‚Äôre in the market forwireless earbuds,power adapters, or anApple Watchband, there are plenty of options at all-time low prices. And you know by now I like to pop in some really cool gaming stuff. How about a full-sizedMaster Sword replicathat plays Zelda music when you swing it and aFinal Fantasy I-VI bundlethat brings the pixel-perfect RPG classics back to life?
Upgrade your tech, complete your Zelda shrine, or relive Final Fantasy‚Äôs golden era, these deals are worth checking out. Some discounts like the iPhone 14 Plus MagSafe case, are downright ridiculous at 80% off. But Apple deals never last long (Tim Cook loves that Apple tax), and limited collectibles definitely sell out fast. If something catches your eye, now‚Äôs the time to add to cart before the price jumps back up.
AliExpress is offering this Arzopa 15"" 1080p USB Type-C portable monitor for only $57 shipped after you apply coupon code ""IFPQHLH"". We've posted deals on this portable monitor in the past, but this is the lowest price we've seen thus far. The marketplace vendor is Arzopa itself so you're getting the full manufacturer's warranty on this brand new, retail packaged item. This monitor is primarily designed to be a secondary display for a laptop, but the S1's 1080p 60Hz panel is a great match for the Nintendo Switch's hardware, since the Switch only supports up to 720p @ 60Hz anyway.
For only $22 more, you can upgrade to the higher end Arzopa Z1FC USB portable monitor, now only $79.19 after coupon code ""IFPQHLH"". It's currently $117 on Amazon. The Z1FC's upgrades include a larger display (16.1"" vs 15.6""), a higher refresh rate (144Hz vs. 60Hz), and better color reproduction (100% sRGB color gamut). This is a better monitor than the S1 to pair with the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally because both gaming handhelds can support refresh rates up to 144Hz.
Apple‚Äôs best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you‚Äôve been eyeing Apple‚Äôs top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we‚Äôre talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you‚Äôre blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don‚Äôt have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.
The games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art. The remastered soundtracks, modernized UI, and quality-of-life improvements bring these classics into the modern age while keeping their original charm intact. Each game features iconic character designs by Kazuko Shibuya and a faithful soundtrack rearranged by Nobuo Uematsu. Whether you‚Äôre reliving the golden age of RPGs or playing them for the first time, this bundle is the ultimate way to experience Final Fantasy‚Äôs roots. The limited-time sale price of $52.49, down from $74.99, makes this an easy win for any RPG fan.

If you‚Äôve ever dreamed of wielding the Master Sword, this Tamashii Nations replica brings that dream to life. At 41.3 inches, it‚Äôs a full-sized, collector-worthy version of Link‚Äôs legendary blade. It‚Äôs not just for display either thanks to authentic sound effects and vibrations activate when you grip and swing it, making you feel like the true Hero of Hyrule.
The hilt features three buttons that play eight iconic songs from Zelda‚Äôs history, including themes from Ocarina of Time, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom. The sword comes with a sheath and display stand, so whether you want to show it off or take it into battle (against your furniture), it‚Äôs ready. At $200, this highly allocated collectible is bound to sell out fast.
A genuine Apple leather case for $11.99? That‚Äôs not a typo. It‚Äôs an 80% discount. Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It‚Äôs slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you‚Äôve been holding off on upgrading your case, now‚Äôs the time before Apple realizes what they‚Äôve done.
If you‚Äôre tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that‚Äôs actually worth every penny.
Why buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it‚Äôs discounted.
If you‚Äôre serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it‚Äôs a must-have.
Still using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you‚Äôre sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.
These aren‚Äôt just Beats. They‚Äôre sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They‚Äôve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple‚Äôs H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won‚Äôt budge during workouts.
These Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They‚Äôre currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.
Luxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it‚Äôll hold up for years. Normally $149, it‚Äôs now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that‚Äôs actually worth jumping on.
This isn‚Äôt your average watch band. Apple‚Äôs Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It‚Äôs made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that‚Äôs 68% recycled, so you‚Äôre doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it‚Äôs a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.
For those who prefer their Pok√©mon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says ""powerful Pok√©mon"" like an angry robot penguin).
I'm so happy to see this in stock. You‚Äôll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon‚Äôs Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.
If somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you‚Äôve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.
Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you‚Äôre not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).
If you‚Äôve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, ""I really need to delete some games,"" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you‚Äôll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It‚Äôs lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won‚Äôt be frantically searching for a charging cable.
Samsung‚ÄôsQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room. The Acoustic Lens Subwoofer ensures deep, punchy bass, while Adaptive Sound and Game Mode Pro make sure everything from dialogue to explosions sounds crisp. At $764 off, this is the cheapest we‚Äôve seen it outside of Black Friday.
LG B4 OLED TVbrings incredible picture quality at a price that doesn‚Äôt require selling a kidney. It features Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, an Œ±8 AI Processor that automatically enhances whatever you‚Äôre watching, and LG‚Äôs latest webOS for easy access to streaming apps and over 300 free LG Channels. Gamers get Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and VRR, plus four HDMI 2.1 ports. At $499.99, this is one of the best deals for an OLED right now.
Samsung‚Äôs S90D OLED TVis a beast, packing AI-powered 4K upscaling, Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for silky smooth gameplay, and Dolby Atmos for immersive sound. Real Depth Enhancer makes everything look more lifelike, and PANTONE validation ensures accurate color reproduction. At $300 off, this is a great price for a high-end 65‚Äù OLED TV.
Sony‚Äôs WH-CH520 headphonesoffer 50 hours of battery life, customizable sound settings, and a lightweight, comfortable design. Multipoint connection makes switching between devices seamless, and DSEE upscaling improves compressed audio. At just $35.95, these are one of the best budget wireless headphones out there today.
Google‚Äôs Pixel Buds Pro 2 bring top-tier noise cancellation, a Tensor A1 chip for AI-powered audio enhancements, and large 11mm drivers for rich bass. Conversation Detection automatically switches to transparency mode when you talk, so you don‚Äôt have to take them out. If you need premium wireless earbuds, this is asolid deal for these 9/10 buds.
Enshrouded is a survival RPG with deep crafting, intense combat, and massive co-op potential. Play solo or team up with up to 16 friends, build custom bases, and fight through a dark, mysterious world. It‚Äôs still in early access, but at $23.99, it‚Äôs worth jumping in now aswe gave it 8/10.

"The Best Deals Today: PS Portal, PS5 DualSense Controllers, New AMD Ryzen X3D CPUs, New iPad Air",2025-03-12T18:25:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-march-12-2025,"Here are the best deals for Wednesday, March 12. Highlights include a rare discount on a (used) PlayStation Portal accessory, Lenovo-exclusive price drops on PS5 DualSense metallic controllers, the first discount we've seen on the iPad Air with M3 chip, USB Type-C cables for only $2.99 apiece, Destiny-themed SteelSeries gaming headsets, and more.

Used: Like New Condition
Looks and functions as if it were new. Moderate packing damage observed during inspection.
ThePlayStation Portalhas never been discounted, but at least you can save on a used one.Amazon Resale(a rebranded Amazon Warehouse) currently has Used: Like New condition PS Portals in stock for only $158.70 shipped. It retails for $199 new, so that's a substantial 20% in savings. A Sony warranty may or may not be included, but Amazon Resale items benefit from the same 30-day return policy you get for buying a new item. We expect this item to sell out pretty quickly.
Lenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.
Amazon is offering a 6-foot INIU USB Type-A to USB Type-C cable for only $2.99 when you apply promo code ""C2ALZ6LN"" during checkout. You can add as many cables as you like and the discount should be applied to each and every cable. These cables are sheathed in nylon braiding for durability and can be used for both data sync and charging (Quick Charge 3.1A compatible). This is a great opportunity to stock up.
If you're thinking of jumping on the AMD bandwagon for your next upgrade, now is certainly the right time to do so. Alongside theRyzen 7 9800X3Dwhich debuted earlier this year, AMD has just released its two higher-end Ryzen 9 siblings in the Zen 5 ""X3D"" stack: the9950X3Dis available for $699 and the9900X3Dis available for $599. Collectively, these processors represent the best gaming chips across both Intel and AMD. Pure gamers should go with the 9800X3D and allocate their funds elsewhere; creators with deeper pockets and a penchant for gaming will benefit from the immense performance uplift on the new Ryzen 9 processors thanks to their increased core count and cache.
Thenew iPad Airsits in the middle of Apple‚Äôs tablet lineup, with better specs than the baseline iPad, but it‚Äôs not as powerful as the iPad Pro. That said, if you need more computing power in a tablet than what the baseline device above offers, the new iPad Air with M3 chip will likely suit you just fine.
As you can tell by the name, it has Apple‚Äôs powerful M3 chip, and it supports Apple Intelligence, unlike the baseline model. It‚Äôs also compatible with a new Magic Keyboard (see it at Apple) that has a row of function keys and a trackpad.
As part of its Spring Sale, SteelSeries is taking 40% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets. The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Desinty 2 in-game items.
As part of a generalHP Days Sale Event, you can score an excellent deal on a 4K-capable gaming PC. Right now, theHP Omen 25L GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super Gaming PChas dropped to $1,399.99 shipped after you apply $50 off coupon code ""HPDAYSPC50"". This is quite easily the lowest price we've seen for a prebuilt RTX 4070 Ti Super gaming desktop.
Amazon is offering a four-pack ofApple AirTagskeyfinders for only $64.49. That's over $35 off the retail price and only $16.10 for each AirTag. This is a very practical accessory for anyone who owns an iPhone and tends to lose small wearables like wallets, keys, or remotes.
4TB for $259.99
Samsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.
Apple's best earbuds are on sale today. Amazon is offering the second generationApple AirPods Prowireless noise-canceling earbuds for only $169.99 shipped, a savings of 32% and the best AirPods deal so far this year. That's about $20 more than theApple AirPods 4 with ANC, down from its usual $70 price premium. Between the two, the AirPods Pro is stillthe superior earbudsbecause it offers better sound quality and noise cancelation.
You can grab this 10,000mAh power bank for only $8.99 after you clip the 10% off and 40% off clippable coupons on the product page. We very rarely see 10,000mAh power banks listed for under $10 so grab this one while you can. This will charge a Nintendo Switch from 0% to 100% about 1.9 times.
For a limited time, Hulu is offering four months of Disney+ and Hulu Basic (Ad-Supported) Bundle for just $2.99 per month. The normal cost of this subscription is $10.99 per month. This deal only comes around a handful of times per year and worth it for just the Disney+ subscription alone.
Pick up a five pack of USB Type-C cables for a grand total of just $7.96 after you apply promo code ""UNWEXMFD"". That averages out to about $1.59 per cable. Lengths include two 3.3ft, two 6.6ft, and an extra long 10ft cable. They're all rated for up to 60W of USB Power Delivery and are encased in a durable braided nylon sheath.

This month, Homeworld 3 headlines the bundle, with other PC games like Wild Hearts, Pacific Drive, Zau, and Gravity Circuit also included.
