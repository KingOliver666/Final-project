Donkey Kong Bananza leak throws a wrench in the Donkey Kong timeline,2025-04-07T22:52:57Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/554164/donkey-kong-bananza-leak-pauline-odd-rock,"And we don’t want to think about the Donkey Kong timeline
byMichael McWhertor
Donkey Kong Bananzamay have intriguing implications for the Donkey Kong timeline, based on a leak for the ape’s upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game. A piece ofartwork apparently leaked by Nintendo of Korea, and then spotted bya poster on Resetera, indicates that another well-known Donkey Kong character heretofore unannounced for the game may appear inBananza.
And her appearance could imply thatDonkey Kong Bananzais a prequel toSuper Mario Odysseyand perhaps even the originalDonkey Kong.
Or maybe not! Because what evenisthe Donkey Kong timeline? But let’s dig in… and wade into potential spoiler territory.
While official artwork and box art forDonkey Kong Bananza— seen above — shows DK being joined by a purple crystal blob known as “the Odd Rock,” nearly identical artwork for the game posted (and later pulled) by Nintendo of Korea shows what appears to be young Pauline adventuring with Donkey Kong. That version of Pauline wears a bracelet that matches the material and color of the Odd Rock.
So, what’s up with that?
Pauline is, of course, a character from the originalDonkey Kong, and the woman that Mario is tasked with rescuing from DK’s clutches in the 1981 arcade original. Pauline later appeared in Nintendo’s Mario vs. Donkey Kong games and was prominently featured in 2017’sSuper Mario Odysseyas the mayor of New Donk City. Pauline has been represented as an adult human woman in all of her Nintendo game appearances.
The Pauline seen in leaked artwork ofDonkey Kong Bananza, however, has childlike proportions. If she’s a child inBananza, that would mean the Switch 2 game is set before the events of the originalDonkey Kong. That, however, makes no sense, given that Donkey Kong encounters Cranky Kong inBananzain his aged, bearded form, and Cranky is — as established by Rare’sDonkey Kong Country— the original Kong that appeared inDonkey Kong. Cranky even references his early battles with Marioin dialogue fromBananza.
However, Nintendo has contradicted itself many times over regarding the relationship between Donkey Kong and Cranky Kong, and which of the two characters was the Donkey Kong that appeared in original arcade game. Suffice it to say, Nintendo’s Donkey Kong lore is a mess.
So there is a chance thatBananzais aDonkey Kongprequel, and that it establishes an early relationship between Pauline and her primate kidnapper. There’s also a strong chance that Pauline is also Odd Rock, made that way as part of a curse inflicted byBananzaantagonists VoidCo. Odd Rock is convinced to join Donkey Kong on his adventure inBananzathrough the power of music, and Pauline is famously an accomplished musician.
There’s also a chance that whatever magic VoidCo used to transform Pauline into a tiny purple rock also made her a child. That would still be weird.
But the Donkey Kong timeline, and the general Super Mario timeline, isextremelyweird. It was established in 2005’sMario & Luigi: Partners in Timethat Mario and Luigi have time traveled to the past and even interacted with infant versions of themselves. In the current Mario Kart canon, Mario and Luigi coexist with Baby Mario and Baby Luigi, indicating that the Mushroom Kingdom and adjacent kingdoms exist within some sort of time paradox. Baby versions of princesses Peach, Daisy, and Rosalina also exist alongside their adult counterparts, so maybe Baby Pauline does too…?
Maybe that’s not Pauline at all in theBananzaartwork. Maybe it’s a young relative who has adopted adult Pauline’s style of dress and makeup. This possibility almost seems the most logical, if Nintendo’s goal is to further confuse the Donkey Kong timeline.
The most important thing to take away from this thought exercise, however, is that the Donkey Kong timeline does not matter. Nintendo should not attempt toexplain it, devotea website to it, nor try to fit future Donkey Kong games into some sort of logical sequence.
Nintendo likely will explain Pauline’s role inDonkey Kong Bananzacloser tothe game’s launch in July. I think the best thing for the company to do at that stage is signal that Cranky Kong is actually Donkey Kong’s son, or that they’re baby and adult versions of the same ape, throwing the entire franchise into temporal chaos.

I went to Universal’s new $7 billion Epic Universe park — here’s what I saw,2025-04-07T22:03:20Z,https://www.polygon.com/theme-parks/553995/epic-universe-tour-nintendo-harry-potter-dragon-photos,"See photos of Super Nintendo World, the How to Train Your Dragon rides, a new Harry Potter land, and much more
byJustin Brown
We’re less than two months away from the grand opening ofEpic Universe, the brand-new park at the Universal Orlando Resort. Originally announced in 2019, the park, which joins the existing Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure, and Volcano Bay and is estimated to have cost over$7 billion, has been highly anticipated by theme park nerds like myself. And, as it turns out, the name is incredibly fitting. During a media preview of the park, I experienced the new attractions, and the sights were truly epic.
Epic Universe is constructed as a series of hubs, connected by Celestial Park, a fantastical nexus. Branching off are the Isle of Berk from How to Train Your Dragon, a magical version of 1920s Paris inspired by Harry Potter, a horror-filled Darkmoor Village inspired by the Universal Monsters, and the world’s largest iteration of the now-infamous Super Nintendo World. Each world is accessed through a portal, all of which have unique special effects that transport travelers from Celestial Park to a completely new realm.
Here’s a peek at some of the standout experiences from each world (click to expand images):
The day started at The Chronos, the park’s imposing front gate that leads to Celestial Park, the central hub of Epic Universe. The area is a calming, lush landscape of gardens and fountains that acts as a nice palate cleanser when moving between the park’s four other elaborately themed worlds.
The marquee attraction of this area is Stardust Racers, a pair of intense dueling roller coasters that act as a spiritual successor to Islands of Adventure’s old Dueling Dragons coasters.
The two sides of Stardust Racers are color coded, yellow and green, and have unique layouts that flip, dive, and dodge one another endlessly.
As someone who can’t get enough of Islands of Adventure’s VelociCoaster, I personally enjoyed Stardust Racers even more.
The Isle of Berk is the park’s largest area and may be the most elaborately themed, all the way down to its unique benches carved like dragons and lampposts lit by piles of smoldering tinder.
Hiccup’s Wing Gliders, a family coaster that launches riders at a smooth 45 mph, gives the area a kinetic energy as it twists and turns throughout.
There’s also Fyre Drill, a wet and wild battle through the area’s lagoon where you’re absolutely guaranteed to get wet.
Elsewhere in Epic Universe’s Berk is The Untrainable Dragon, a stage show where Hiccup and Toothless fly over the crowd in their attempt to save Berk once more. It reminded me of a Broadway-style musical crammed into a tight 20-minute run time, complete with live Viking drummers, impeccable vocalists, and imposing, life-size dragons controlled by hidden puppeteers. Puppetry is all over the land, which is filled with character actors and large-size dragons with a similar vibe to Disney’s Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge.
My favorite ride in the land was the high-flying Dragon Racer’s Rally, where the intensity of the ride is completely up to each individual rider. Each vehicle sits a single person and can tip side to side freely, even rotating upside down. It’s completely up to you if you’d like a relaxing flight through the sky or a wild ride of endless barrel rolls. (And rest assured, tipping yourself upside down isnoteasy — I tried my hardest and only managed to do it once!)
Upon stepping through the Harry Potter-themed portal, I was transported to 1920s Paris with magical moments lurking behind every corner. In this world, inspired by the Fantastic Beasts and core Harry Potter films, visitors can browse a brand-new wand shop, eat at one of several magical eateries, and even catch a show at Le Cirque Arcanus, a magical circus that slowly devolves into a battle between its ringmaster and Newt Scamander’s beasts.
The centerpiece attraction of Epic Universe’s new Wizarding World is Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry, hiding in an entrance to the Parisian Metro.
Getting to the ride is an experience in and of itself. After traveling through the magical Metrofloo system in a burst of green flames, I walked my way through a jaw-dropping, four-story atrium with views into various offices throughout the ministry.
After passing by several rooms of talking portraits and hearing a warning from Umbridge’s elf Higgledy, I was led onto the ride vehicle: a 14-seat elevator that resembles Disney’s Tower of Terror.
The difference here is that this elevator does not drop, it moves sideways. The ride utilizes special effects to simulate a magical elevator ride caught in the middle of a battle to capture Umbridge and bring her to justice. No pics from inside just yet, as Universal is trying to keep a few surprises for the public.
Dark Universe is a smoldering, brooding world tucked away in the back of the park. After passing through the foreboding portal, I entered Darkmoor Village, a gothic land where monsters roam the streets. Immediately upon entering I had a close call with the Invisible Man, wrapped in his bandages, as he slowly stalked innocent bystanders throughout the area.
As I entered deeper into Darkmoor, I encountered the Burning Blade Tavern, an eatery tucked beneath a windmill that is ceremoniously set ablaze once every 20 minutes.
Weaving throughout the world is Curse of the Werewolf, a mid-size spinning roller coaster that launches you both forward and backward.
The main attraction here is Monsters Unchained: The Frankenstein Experiment, where the great-great-granddaughter of Dr. Frankenstein attempts to trap Dracula in the catacombs beneath the imposing castle. The ride is absolutely spectacular, utilizing the same robotic-arm ride system as Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey but with next-level special effects.
And while the ride (and park on the whole) is filled with monsters galore, including Frankenstein’s monster, Swamp Thing, and the Wolf Man, this is no haunted house. Rest assured, for the horror-averse travelers like myself, there are absolutely zero jump scares throughout the ride. Rather than trying to scare riders out of their seats, Dark Universe focuses on wowing riders with a truly immersive experience.
Epic Universe’s Super Nintendo World is a near replica of the one in Universal Studios Japan (versus the smaller version in Universal Studios Hollywood). After entering the warp pipe, I was immediately transported to a highly saturated landscape of coins, question blocks, Koopas, Goombas, and mushrooms as far as the eye can see.
I walked through Peach’s castle and witnessed magical warping portraits, rode on a Yoshi for an adventure to find the golden egg, and used special power-up bands (sold separately) to play mini challenges scattered across the world.
The third iteration ofMario Kart: Bowser’s Challengetruly cements Mario Kart as the ultimate “shoot-’em-up”’ ride across Universal’s theme parks. Thanks to the AR headsets that allow you to pick up item boxes and shoot enemies, it really does feel like you’re living in a video game rather than simply riding a ride that simulates one. By gamifying the experience, Bowser’s Challenge is kind of like the bigger quarter-eating arcade cabinet ever, complete with a leaderboard that makes you want to play (or should I say ride) over and over again until you hit a high score.
Super Nintendo World is the only realm with a portal-within-a-portal, transporting travelers from the Mushroom Kingdom to Donkey Kong Country. This area boasts a breathtaking series of waterfalls that cascade from the golden statue’s mouth. (The Japanese version has no waterfalls; instead, the golden statue exhales a much less impressive wisp of fog.)
While DK’s Mine-Cart Madness is easily one of the most anticipated rides in the park, it’s honestly as thrilling to watch as it is to ride. The ride vehicle is attached to an arm that extends far above the coaster’s real track, allowing ride designers to utilize fake tracks to simulate Donkey Kong Country’s infamous mine cart level.
By the end of my day, I felt like I had just scratched the surface of all that Epic Universe has to offer. While rushing from ride to ride, I passed by countless costumed characters that were imploring me to slow down and interact with them, which I was desperate to do — every inch of the park is so carefully constructed and meticulously themed, you just want to stop and stare at the edges.
I love theme parks and roller coasters, and I left Epic Universe with plenty of deeper impressions. Check back soon for more.

Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges designed to be spit out,2025-04-07T21:16:05Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/554646/nintendo-switch-2-still-taste-bad,"‘We have indeed made it so that if it enters your mouth, you’ll spit it out’
byNicole Carpenter
Nintendouses a bitterant called denatonium benzoate applied to its Nintendo Switch cartridgesto dissuade people from putting cartridges in their mouths. It’s a substance that tastes absolutely foul, often used in similar situations — to keep people from consuming things they shouldn’t be, like antifreeze. While a Nintendo Switch cartridge might not be poisonous, you could choke on it. Children, especially, are at risk; they put all sorts of things in their mouths.
A Nintendo spokesperson confirmed to Polygon in 2017 that it uses this non-toxic coating to “to avoid the possibility of accidental ingestion.”
With the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement, it’s natural to wonder,What does a Nintendo Switch 2 cartridge taste like?Probably quite the same.Nintendo technical director Takuhiro Dohtadidn’t confirm that it’s denatoium benzoate, but he did say that it’s designed so that if you put it in your mouth you’ll spit it out. He advised not to try tasting it in an interview with GameSpot.
“We don’t want anybody to be at risk of any unwanted consumption,” Dohta said. “We have indeed made it so that if it enters your mouth, you’ll spit it out.”
Nintendo wasn’t offering taste samples of Switch 2 cartridgesduring Nintendo’s console preview event, and it’s unclear yet ifanyonehas tasted the cartridge. We’ll all likely have to wait until the console is released on June 5 to consider for our selves if we want to find out by putting one of the$80 cartridgesin our own mouths. It sounds like Dohta hasn’t — and won’t — be salivating at the chance to lickMario Kart World, though: “When the Nintendo Switch was being developed, I did lick it once, but never again. I can’t believe that other people are trying that.”

Switch 2 game-key cards won’t be account- or console-locked,2025-04-07T18:20:39Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/554236/switch-2-game-key-card-digital-account-console-lock,"A sort of middle-ground between physical and digital games
byIan Walker
Good news:Switch 2game-key cards won’t be locked to the first account or console that uses them.
“[Game-key cards] will start up on the console or system that it is slotted into, so it’s not tied to an account or anything,” Tetsuya Sasaki, general manager of Nintendo’s technology development division,told GameSpot.
Unlike regular game cartridges,game-key cardssimply allow access to a digital download of the game in question when inserted into the Switch 2.
“Game-key cards are different from regular game cards, because they don’t contain the full game data,”Nintendo’s support page explains. “Instead, the game-key card is your ‘key’ to downloading the full game to your system via the internet. After it’s downloaded, you can play the game by inserting the game-key card into your system and starting it up like a standard physical game card.”
Nintendo has yet to say which games will be released on game-key cards and why, but common speculation considers the format as a way to distribute games that have grown too big for the Switch 2’s 64 GB cartridges while appeasing those who continue to push back against an all-digital future. Unfortunately, there’s no indication game-key cards will be any cheaper than regular physical cartridges — you may have heard, butMario Kart Worldwill cost a whopping $80, and that was beforeTrump’s tariffsannouncement — and an internet connection will be necessary for the initial download.
Switch 2 launches worldwide on June 5.

"Why the Switch 2 is so expensive, according to Nintendo",2025-04-07T12:48:46Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553517/price-interview-tariffs,"We spoke with Nintendo’s Bill Trinen to get to the bottom of the Switch 2’s price point
byRuss Frushtick
Last week, Nintendo revealed a ton of information about theSwitch 2. And while there were some surprises — like abizarrely destructive Donkey Kong game— the real shock was that of the sticker variety. The prices of both theSwitch 2 console ($449.99)and its games (as much as$79.99 forMario Kart World) indicated that Nintendo’s next generation would not come cheaply.
To get a better understanding of why there has been such a dramatic increase in price over the previous generation, we spoke with Bill Trinen, vice president of player & product experience at Nintendo.
[Ed. note:This interview was conducted on April 3, the day before Nintendo announced it woulddelay Switch 2 pre-ordersin the U.S. due to uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s sweeping new tariffs.]
To start off with, I asked Trinen what exactly was driving the price up on the console itself (coming in at $150 more than the original Switch).
“Well, I would say there’s a couple of things,” said Trinen. “Number one, we’re unfortunately living in an era where I think inflation is affecting everything. And it’s affecting everything from day-to-day prices, it’s affecting technology and things of that nature. I think we’re also seeing smart devices now… I wish they were not nearly as expensive as they are. They’re certainly a lot more expensive than they were when they originally came out in the mid-2000s. So as you add more technology into a system, especially in this day and age, that drives additional cost.”
Trinen went on to explain that the Switch 2’s upgrades, like the redesigned Joy-Cons withmouse controlsandsystem-wide chat, add more value (and therefore more cost) to the overall package.
But if it’s simply the internals that are driving the console’s price up, it did make me wonder why there’s such a huge variance between the Japanese-language Switch 2 (which will cost 49,980 yen, or approximately $343) and the Switch 2 that supports all languages, whose price is more than $100 higher than that in some regions.
“An average consumer may not be fully aware of the varying market differences between the different territories,” Trinen explained. “So globally, Nintendo takes an approach of looking at: What are the market circumstances in different territories, how are things impacting those market circumstances, and what options do we have to try to appropriately price the product based on the local market circumstances? And I think that’s an example of one where because of some unique circumstances in the Japanese market, [Nintendo has] tried to find a way to essentially create an opportunity that satisfies that market, but without having broader impacts.”
Trinen didn’t specifically address recent global trade issues, driven by President Donald Trump’s trade war with practically every nation on Earth, but it was clear that these undercurrents of uncertainty had an impact on the Switch 2’s pricing. Nintendo actually moved itsSwitch production to Vietnam back in 2019in an effort to avoid the heavy tariffs placed on China during the first Trump administration. Unfortunately for Nintendo, on the day of the big debut of the Switch 2,Trump instituted a 46% tariff on Vietnam. The high price for the Switch 2 might have been the result of some educated guesswork from Nintendo to allow the company to better weather the market conditions that the trade wars might bring. Clearly, that guesswork is ongoing, as pre-orders have been delayed due to the incoming tariffs.
Outside of hardware manufacturing, Nintendo fans have also been concerned about rising software prices. Since the days of the Wii U, Nintendo has stuck to the $59.99 price point for just about every game. That continued for more than 10 years untilThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdomarrived in 2023 at a$69.99 price point. And now, just two years after that, we’re seeingMario Kart Worldhit $79.99.
I asked Trinen to explain the rising cost of games, and what’s driving it for Nintendo.
“The price of video games has been very stable for a very long time,” said Trinen. “I actually have an ad on my phone that I found from 1993, whenDonkey Kong Countryreleased on the SNES at $59. That’s a very, very long time where pricing on games has been very stable. And so obviously, it would be great if we didn’t live in an era when everything is getting more expensive, so there’s that reality of it.”
Trinen went on to say that Nintendo does look at each title individually when determining pricing, and that its decision-making is based on a variety of factors.
“We take an approach of looking at: What is the experience, and what are players going to enjoy out of this game? What is the length of the game — what’s the volume of the experience? How in-depth is it? And then we price appropriately based on what we think the value of that experience is,” said Trinen. “And so a good example would be something likeTears of the Kingdomon Nintendo Switch. We did price that at a higher price point. That didn’t mean all of a sudden that every game on Nintendo Switch was all of a sudden priced at that higher price.
“And so similarly, with something likeMario Kart[World], with something likeDonkey Kong Bananza, we’re really looking at the experience and saying, ‘OK, this we feel is an appropriate price,’ taking into [account] a lot of these other factors that are just impacting pricing overall in this day and age.”
While it’s clear that there are business reasons for these price increases across the board, it’s unlikely that those explanations will entirely satisfy fans looking to experience the next generation of Nintendo games on a budget. Now it’s just a question of whether those fans are willing to gobble up copies ofMario Kart Worldat the same astonishing pace as they did withMario Kart 8 Deluxeon the Switch. A slow start might be the only thing that could stop the $79.99 price point in its tracks for the rest of this generation.

Nintendo confirms you will have to pay to use the Switch 2’s C button,2025-04-07T12:48:17Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553458/switch-2-nintendo-confirms-c-button-price,"The dedicated GameChat button will require a recurring fee
byTyler Colp
Nintendo has made its own Discord-like chat app for theSwitch 2, and it’s going to charge you for it. Once the free period is over on March 31, 2026,GameChat, and the C button that activates it, will require a Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) membership.
So what happens if you aren’t a subscriber and press the C button? Not much, vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen told Polygon in a recent interview.
“You would be able to find out about the NSO subscription there and get a sense of some of the functionality,” he said.
Presumably, this is how you’d learn that GameChat works a lot like Discord video chat works on PC. You can talk with your friends in handheld or docked mode via a built-in microphone and stream your gameplay to each other. There’s even acamera you can buyto overlay onto your stream, or just to chat face-to-face.
But unless you have an active NSO membership, you’ll have a whole button dedicated to nothing on your Switch 2. It doesn’t even sound like you can remap it to something else. It will just be a reminder of the annual $19.99 fee you may or may not be handing to Nintendo every year (or $49.99 for the Expansion Pack).
Trinen says the C button has a price tag because GameChat is “part of the overall platform experience” and that “NSO really is a critical piece of the Nintendo Switch 2 experience.” He listed off some of the new Switch 2-exclusive benefits, likeaccess to old GameCube gamesand free upgrades toThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom.
That subscription fee will be on top of a console that’s already going to cost you $449.99 — or possibly more ifU.S. President’s Trump’s tariffsprompt Nintendo to increase it. We won’t know if GameChat will prove to be worth it until theSwitch 2 releases in June.
Correction (April 8):A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the frequency of Nintendo Switch Online’s fees. It has been updated to reflect NSO’s annual subscription fees.

Why music will likely never return to Nintendo’s eShops,2025-04-07T12:47:31Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553440/nintendo-eshop-no-music-switch-2-why,"Doot doot doot doot doot do do
byChelsea Stark
There is something perfectly simple and catchy about the Wii eShop’s theme song. It’s been remixed and parodied, even becoming the perfect sketch fodder forNirvana the Band the Show. You’re probably already humming it right now.
While that music was so iconic, there is a surprisingly practical reason that later system shops, like the Nintendo Switch, didn’t feature a theme song. That trend will continue on Switch 2.
“Unlike back then, the eShop now has lots of videos that are showcasing the games,” Nintendo Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto said. “We didn’t want to intrude on that, so we don’t have music there.”
I asked this in an interview that took place after these same Switch 2 hardware developers did a longer press conference with a large group of press in New York on Wednesday. During that interview, another Switch 2 developer, Takuhiro Dohta, said Kawamoto had “strong feelings” about the eShop. Kawamoto followed up that he “probably booted the Wii Shopping Channel the most out of any application [on the Wii].”
Kawamoto did tell me the Wii Shopping Channel music still gets stuck in his head, which of course it does.
As for actual improvements to this quiet Switch 2 eShop, Kawamoto said on Wednesday his focus was performance.
“I wanted to make sure that it was a smooth experience. That the scrolling of the list doesn’t stall, that it’s very smooth, pages load fast,” he told the room in New York.
We’ll see more of the Switch 2’s eShop when the console launches June 5.

You’ll be able to move your Animal Crossing island to the Switch 2 easily,2025-04-07T12:47:06Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553410/acnh-animal-crossing-new-horizons-island-transfer,"Whew, thank goodness
byJulia Lee
Good news! If you’ve been fretting about abandoning yourAnimal Crossing: New Horizonsisland save on a console that will rot away in storage, then worry not. You’ll be able to seamlessly transfer your island save data to the Nintendo Switch 2, without needing to download an extra app or use a cloud save.
The Nintendo Switch 2 will have the option to do a complete system transfer from your original Switch, moving overeverythingin one process — including your beloved island. Nintendo confirmed this during an interview with Polygon last week.
“So I should clarify that when you do the system transfer, everything like save data will remain on the Nintendo Switch and once it moves to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well,” Programming Management Group Senior Director Takuhiro Dohta said. “But the [Animal Crossing] island will be an actual move. So it will leave Nintendo Switch and move over to Nintendo Switch 2.”
Before, there were technically two ways to move your island. You could save it to the cloud and then download it back (though this was more so for if you lose or broke your Switch) or you would need todownload the “Animal Crossing: New Horizons Island Transfer Tool” appon your Switch to transfer it from one console to the other. The former cloud method would also require you tocontact Nintendo to download the data, so. Not great.
While neither of these methods were horrendous, they just seemed a little convoluted to move save data. It’s kind of understandably so, as Nintendo doesn’t want you to have clones of your island across multiple devices and whatnot, but still! It’s nice to know that you won’t have to deal with any extra frills when it comes to keeping your island safe. While many of us (myself included) haven’t touchedNew Horizonsin years, it’d be sad to lose all the hard work we put in.
That being said, you’ll need both your original Nintendo Switch and your Nintendo Switch 2 on hand to do this transfer, so if you’retrading your Switchto get a cheaper Switch 2, you’ll still need to use the cloud back-up, it seems. ☹

I’m worried the Switch 2 might be too heavy for me to enjoy,2025-04-04T22:41:06Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553791/nintendo-switch-2-weight-comparison,"Console heft is a personal preference, but worth some thought
byChelsea Stark
Reporting assistance from Samit Sarkar
After spending some time with Nintendo’sSwitch 2last week during its hands-on event in New York, I’m a little worried about its weight. Specifically, I’m worried it’s going to be less comfortable for me to hold the console in handheld mode for long periods of time like I have comfortably done with the original Switch and the Switch OLED.
The problem with these hands-on events is I’m never playing one game for long. Only one game,Mario Kart World, was set up to work in handheld mode during play, and I was able to play three or so races before my demo time ended. (The rest of the game experiences used the Pro Controller, Joy-Con, orJoy-Con in mouse mode.) The Switch 2 was also sturdily tethered to the table, with a secure bracket on its back, adding to the weight. But still, I could definitely feel the difference.Are my arms getting tired?Are they MORE tired than normal?I’m also standing, of course, and not playing while sitting — or lying on my couch, the perfect way to wile away a weekend.
After the hands-on event, I spent time looking at the spec sheets for the Switch 2, the Switch OLED, the original Switch, and the Steam Deck to figure out exactly how much more weight I was feeling. The Switch 2, with Joy-Con 2 attached, is 534 grams (or 1.18 lbs). My current preferred handheld, the Switch OLED, is 420 grams (or 14.82 oz, a little less than a pound). And the Steam Deck, which I own but kind of loathe using because I feel like it’s too heavy, is 669 grams (or 1.47 pounds).
This kind of console weight preference feels very personal, and sometimes gendered. I also am nearsighted and hold my handhelds closer to my face than many people, thus possibly increasing my arm strain. But the Switch 2 is also a device that is targeted at children, especially with launch titles like the crowd-pleasing Mario Kart franchise, so weight is probably a factor for lots of people thinking about playing one for a while.
Looking at the percentage change, the Switch 2 is 27% heavier than a Switch OLED, and only 20% lighter than a Steam Deck. That’s not nothing! I’m concerned the Switch 2 might not be as ideal for me because of that increase.
If you’re curious about the weight change, here’s a table:
There’s of course lots else to consider too. The Switch 2 is running a faster CPU and has a bigger, brighter LCD screen. There are obviously reasons it’s going to be this heavy. And while I am excited about the increased frame rate and variable refresh rate, I also want to be able t hold the dang thing for more than 45 minutes.
I asked the Switch 2 hardware developers about the console weight, and how they balance making the console everyone can play and getting in the all the technical features they want.
“We make it. We pick it up. We try it, and we make it again,” said Takuhiro Dohta, senior director for Nintendo’s Program Management Group. “There’s a lot of rinse and repeat of that. During that [process], there are then discussions and elements of the hardware, like, ‘We want a bigger screen, so this is the size we want to go with.’ or considering the feel of the controller, ‘This is how we want the controller to feel.’
“These are elements of the hardware that we have to maintain and it’s within those parameters that we start to make fine-tuned adjustments.”
After that, they rely on the staff of Nintendo to weigh in.
“At Nintendo, there are all different types of people: people who are big and strong, people who are maybe smaller and not as strong,” Dohta continued. “And so we then take that around [the] company and have them hold it and give us their feedback. And that’s how we kind of adjust.”
Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto added that once the team has settled on the size and general weight, they have lots of options to fine-tune the process, because “the lighter, the better.”
“We take different stabs at the stand shape or the shape of the console. And on the console we have different use of plastic and metal. So it’s balancing all these different factors and wants, and then balancing capabilities and performance,” Kawamoto said.
It probably won’t be clear if I find the Switch 2 comfortable enough to use until I get to spend some actual time with it in a natural setting: without a weighted tether, stretched out on a couch. But for something that could cost quite a bit, it’s worth thinking about before launch — or lifting some weights, I guess.

Trump’s trade war swallowed the Switch 2 — but what happens next?,2025-04-04T21:57:20Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553604/switch-2-pre-order-delay-tariffs-economic-analysis-joost-van-dreunen,"What was that about keeping politics out of games?
byZoë Hannah
Nintendo’s Switch 2 ramp-up week started with a cheerful bang (a jingle, really) at Wednesday’sSwitch 2 Directthat revealed the sleeknew console’s release date,launch games, and features.Donkey Kong hype aboundedonline, at least until the company’s news releases started trickling out to outlets like Polygon, and sticker shock took over.Nintendo announced it would charge $450 for its consoleand$80 for its flagship game,Mario Kart World(or $500 for the two bundled together).
Around the same time, President Trump announced hissweeping global trade plan, which included significant tariffs for virtually every country in the world — includinguninhabited regions. To put it simply, everyone began freaking the fuck out in response, andthe stock marketdid, too. In the news and on social media, both “Switch 2” and “Trump tariffs” began trending, marking the beginning of a very chaotic 48 hours in which the release of a highly anticipated game console and the blundering whims of the U.S. president became inextricably linked not just for the folks who care about games, but for consumers of other mainstream media, too.
The tariffs will impact the cost of almost everything Americans purchase, all amidst stocks plummeting downward andsocial servicesgetting dismantled. That might include the cost of Switch 2 — a price that a lot of people weren’t happy about beforeNintendo announced it would delay pre-ordersdue to “tariffs and evolving market conditions.” Panic has ensued for fans:What if the Switch 2 is even more expensive than $450?That’s on top of this other bit of lurking dread:What if there aren’t enough Switch 2s to go around?
Business professor and author Joost van Dreunen said in an email to Polygon that Nintendo’s “explicit reference to tariffs” in its statement is highly unusual for the company, and for Japanese corporate posturing in general. “Japanese companies traditionally avoid commenting on foreign policy matters, making this directness particularly noteworthy. By specifically naming tariffs as the cause rather than using vaguer language about ‘supply chain challenges’ or ‘global market conditions,’ Nintendo is clearly signaling to shareholders and consumers that the delay stems from external policy decisions rather than internal planning failures.” (Polygon reached out to Nintendo for comment but did not hear back before press time.)
There have long been a vocal few in the gaming community who talk about “keeping politics out of games,” which is a senseless take devoid of critical thought to begin with. But that take has never been more senseless than it is right now: Trump’s trade war is, quite literally, impacting games. And Nintendo wants us to know it, too.
But it’s likely not because so many gamers’ favorite nostalgia manufacturer is taking a stand against the big bad along with us. It’s a strategic decision (though I wouldn’t be surprised if Nintendo’s execs privately despise Trump for this decision and maybe even others).
“It insulates Nintendo from criticism about their own execution while gently educating their consumer base about how trade policy directly impacts product availability and potentially pricing,” van Dreunen said. “The reference to ‘evolving market conditions’ gives them flexibility to make adjustments beyond just responding to tariffs, potentially including competitive positioning against the rumored PS5 Pro price drop or shifts in component availability.”
Trump’s newest round of tariffs include a hefty increase up to 46% for Vietnam, the location Nintendo moved much of its manufacturing to several years ago when Trump increased tariffs on China. But van Dreunen doesn’t think it’s too likely Nintendo will raise the price of Switch 2 so close to launch, which he says would be “unprecedented.”
“Nintendo needs time to assess whether their existing price point of $449.99 remains viable or if their projected margins have been compromised. The delay gives them flexibility to either secure additional inventory ahead of potential tariff implementation, explore manufacturing alternatives, or adjust their go-to-market strategy,” van Dreunen said. “More likely, Nintendo will maintain the announced price but potentially reduce initial production volume or adjust bundle offerings to preserve margins. They’re essentially buying time to make the most informed decision possible in a rapidly evolving trade environment.”
And while it’s tempting to take van Dreunen’s salient expertise here as a sign that it’s not all that bad, he also says the gaming industry tends to offer a decent pulse on the rest of the economy.
“Nintendo specifically makes an interesting barometer because their audience skews more mainstream and family-oriented than competitors, meaning their customer base includes the middle-income consumers most affected by economic headwinds,” van Dreunen said. “In this case, Nintendo’s response to these tariffs offers a preview of how global companies with complex supply chains will navigate increasing trade barriers – not by immediately passing costs to consumers, but by tactical delays and strategic reassessment. Their caution signals the broader uncertainty facing multinational companies as global trade tensions escalate.”
The only thing we know for sure is that a lot more uncertainty is coming our way.

Are PC handhelds like Steam Deck really competitors for Switch 2?,2025-04-04T21:19:21Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553131/pc-handhelds-steam-deck-vs-switch-2,"They compete closely on price and specs, but Nintendo still owns the mass market
byOli Welsh
When Nintendo launched the Switch in 2017, it had no competition in dedicated handheld gaming, a sector it had established with the Game Boy in 1989 and ruled ever since. Sega had come and gone; Sony, after two determined attempts with the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita, had just about given up.
As Switch 2 nears launch in 2025, things look a little different — but only a little. The colossal success of the Switch has awoken the slumbering giants. Sony and Microsoft are now reportedly preparingdedicated PlayStationandXbox handhelds. Improbably, though, it was the PC gaming sphere that made the first move. Valve led the way with the Steam Deck in 2022, which swiftly seeded a growing ecosystem of similar, PC-based handheld devices from manufacturers like Lenovo and Asus. After a quiet decade, non-Nintendo handheld gaming is a thing again. And that means the Switch 2 will not run unopposed for handheld gaming supremacy.
In a sense, Nintendo is the victim of its own strategic foresight. With the Switch, it was the first to spot that the narrowing gap in processing power between mobile and at-home devices had enabled a unification of handheld and home gaming experiences. Finally, the same games could work in both contexts. The Switch proved this point emphatically, and now everyone wants a piece.
But with dedicated devices from Sony and Microsoft still years away, for now that competition must come from Steam Deck and the other PC handhelds. My colleague Chris Plante persuasively argued that these devices representNintendo’s “biggest threat in the present.”They trounce the Switch on specs and have closed the gap to contemporary AAA gaming in the home until it’s almost imperceptible. Software-wise, they offer the compelling value and staggering range of just about everything on Steam — and much of PC gaming beyond it, if you’re prepared to fiddle about a bit.
It’s true that the Switch 2’s price and specs put it into direct competition with the lower-end PC handhelds. At $449, it’s $50 more expensive than the base model Steam Deck. The Switch 2 isroughly comparable in power and storage, has a much better screen, and with detachable controllers and a TV dock included in the price, it’s much more flexible to use. The base model of Asus’ ROG Ally handheld ($499 or thereabouts) and the new Lenovo Legion Go S ($549) are also pretty close competitors in terms of specs.
In raw hardware terms, these are all very similar devices. It’s worth noting that the Switch 2’sexclusive accesstoNvidia’s market-leading DLSS upscaling technologyshould allow it to punch a bit above its weight class. But realistically, there’s not much between them.
But — and it’s a very, very big but — comparing the Switch 2 to the PC handhelds by running your finger down a spec sheet, or by noting that they can all playCivilization 7andElden Ring, does not tell the whole story. Within an enthusiast bubble, PC handhelds are a big deal, but they do not exist in the same universe as Nintendo consoles. To put it bluntly, PC handhelds are still niche.
The Steam Deck has been a big success for Valve, but let’s put it in perspective. Valve has not discussed sales numbers, but market research estimates thatit has sold around 4 million Steam Decks. And Steam Deck dwarfs its competition; the same research suggests that, in total, around 6 million PC handhelds have been sold in the three years since the Steam Deck went on the market. Worryingly, there aren’t yet signs of strong growth in sales.
Stack that up against the Switch’s 150 million units sold and the wild difference in scale becomes evident. Of course, it isn’t a directly analogous comparison. PC handhelds have only existed for three years; the Switch has been around for eight years, and Nintendo has been in the handhelds business for more than 35 years. All the same, Nintendo predicts it will sell11 million units of the aging Switchin its current fiscal year — more than five times the predicted sales of PC handhelds in that time. Meanwhile, analysts reckon that theSwitch 2 will, on its own, outstrip the size of the PC handheld marketalmost immediately, with 6 to 8 million units available at launch, and up to 20 million sales in its first year.
Valve is a big player in the game industry, and a very rich company. But it is a newcomer to the world of consumer electronics retail, and it has a lot of catching up to do — if it’s even interested in doing it. Steam Deck isn’t available to purchase in stores; you can’t walk into Walmart and pick one up. Valve is not buying ads for it on TV or at bus stops. Companies like Lenovo and Asus have more traditional distribution channels, but they’re tiny minnows compared to the marketing, retail, and distribution might of Nintendo.
There are other factors that make the PC handhelds niche products. The user experience of Windows-based handhelds like the ROG Ally and Legion Go is notoriously bad. Valve’s SteamOS is much better, but it is still quite far removed from the reliability and simplicity offered by Nintendo and the other console platforms.
You cannot unbox a new Steam Deck, turn it on, and play a game straight away. It requires tinkering to get the best out of. Although Valve’s verification system for games is a helpful guide, it’s not guaranteed you’ll get a good, playable experience on every game. The Deck is also bulky and heavy. You would never buy one for a child, or share one within a family — it’s clearly not designed to be shared. Realistically, it remains a tough sell for anyone who isn’t a gaming hobbyist.
There is, reportedly, one upcoming device that may be able to change this narrative a little. Microsoft is said to be working with a PC handheld manufacturer ona system that will have Xbox brandingand a user interface based on a new version of the Xbox PC app. This has the potential to be a more user-friendly device that offers easy access to PC Game Pass on the go, which would be quite compelling. But, although Microsoft has now been making Xbox consoles for over 20 years, it hasconsistently struggledto use that experience to make PC gaming more seamless, despite repeated attempts — and the device doesn’t sound like much more than a stopgap until Microsoft’s own dedicated handheld console is ready.
Nintendo will not have true competition in handhelds until its peers in the console space get involved. Microsoft is reportedly eyeing 2027 for the release of its handheld Xbox. Sony’s portable PS5 is also said to be years away, if it’s ever released. Things are definitely heating up for Nintendo, and by the end (or even the middle) of the Switch 2’s life, the handheld gaming market is sure to be much busier than it is now. But for the next few years, competition for the new console will remain distant — at best.

Disney Villains Cursed Café is the Modern AU of my dreams,2025-04-04T21:15:29Z,https://www.polygon.com/review/552799/disney-villains-cursed-cafe-review,"Am I enabling the Disney villains in their modern evil schemes? Maybe, maybe so
byPetrana Radulovic
I did something horrible. I told Jafar, the scheming vizier villain in Disney’sAladdin, about cryptocurrency, and now he’s determined to get WyshCoin off the ground by selling the luxurious lifestyle associated with the brand. The problem is he’s actually broke, so I need to brew him teleportation potion after teleportation potion so he can sneak into increasingly extravagant venues in order to sell the illusion of the WyshCoin lifestyle.
That’s just a day in the life of a potionista (a portmanteau of potion maker and barista) at the Cursed Café, the coffee shop at the center ofDisney Villains Cursed Café. The game is a partnership between Disney Studios and indie team Bloom Digital Media. InDisney Villains Cursed Café, I spend time brewing potions, talking to my villainous clientele and helping them achieve their goals (or sometimes, very specificallynothelping them). It’s a modern setting, which means the villains all have fun, contemporary designs — and contemporary problems.
Yes, Jafar’s setting up a cryptocurrency, and Snow White’s Evil Queen is running her own pyramid scheme. Meanwhile, Gaston is trying to impress his new golf bros at the country club he just joined. It’s hilarious to see what sorts of villainous shenanigans these iconic characters get up to in a modern, low-stakes setting. They’re taking over the world… in their own ways. And hey, in the year 2025, that does mean having huge social media followings!
The writing is sharp and funny, with some particularly pointed dialogue options (you can tell the villains that in this modern world, the rulers are the 1%, for instance). Seeing the characters interact is also a highlight. Cruella and the Evil Queen roll their eyes at Gaston’s attempts at dating on “the apps.” Maleficent and Ursula reluctantly team up for a social media collaboration. And throughout it all, the art style is incredibly charming, an elevated rendering of the characters’ Disney movie counterparts with some painterly accents.
With each in-game day, I have three chances to serve customers. Most of the time, this means picking between two villains to serve. But don’t worry — if it’s Cruella and Jafar at the counter and I pick Jafar, the rest of Cruella’s storyline will still unfold. The brewing mechanic is pretty straightforward; I just look at the recipe list to find the requested potion and then select the ingredients in my cupboards.
Occasionally, the villains will have bigger requests, and taking those on will continue the next big chapters of their plots. They’ll present me with their desired potion, often something malevolent and more complicated. My handy potion book will suggest a “good” option as well: It’ll have the same outcome, but probably result in less property damage. If you want to try a different option — or if you accidentally add the wrong ingredients — you’ll have the choice at the end of the day to buy a re-do from Yzma. The branching is simple, but enjoyable.
There is also an overarching mystery about the previous owner of the café that continues to perplex me — and is surprisingly complicated to figure out. One time, after I had messed up a day and intended to redo it, Yzma handed me a key that unlocked a secret room that held clues about this mysterious owner. But since I had fumbled the Evil Queen’s storyline, I erased the memories of that day to try again. The second time, though, I didn’t get the key — and a few in-game days later, I still haven’t! I’m not sure what conditions trigger more information about this storyline, but I’m determined to keep selling potions to find out.
But even if I’m still struggling at figuring out the grander mystery of the Cursed Café, I’m invested in the storylines of my customers. Even if I’m notactuallyinvesting in WyshCoin, every time I see Jafar at the counter, I eagerly select him to serve because I just want to know what the heck he’s scheming next. Maybe I’m tapping into my own inner villain by enabling him, but hey, you don’t become the favorite potion brewer of some of the best Disney villains by playing hero.

Nintendo built the Switch 2 for the next societal shutdown,2025-04-04T21:14:54Z,https://www.polygon.com/553024/nintendo-built-the-switch-2-for-the-next-societal-shutdown,"GameChat opens new doors for players, but the feature is haunted by the past and future

TheSwitch 2is a social machine. For the console’s second iteration, Nintendo prioritizedprocessing powercapable oflarge-scale multiplayer. TheJoy-Cons’ new C buttonlets you instantly join a group chat with shared-screen play options. Extensions in the Nintendo Switch Online app will add dimension to old titles, includingautobuild-sharing inThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. As producer Kouichi Kawamoto put it in Nintendo’s post-revealAsk the Developerupdate, development of the Switch 2 was inspired by memories of “playing games together as children at a friend’s house or in a student lounge, where everyone brought their own consoles.” The clear goal is to bring frictionless community play to Switch 2 that will be safe for all ages.
The pitch is harmonious on paper and, based on footage in theSwitch 2 Direct, existentially terrifying as a practice. Inspired by one of the defining experiences of the early 2020s, in which many of us were sequestered inside our homes playingAnimal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo has, intentionally or not, optimized Switch 2 for the next global shutdown.
Work on the Switch 2 began in earnest in 2019, according to Kawamoto, and the early focus was on improving software performance through tech upgrades. But development soon became entangled with the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdown protocols forced Nintendo’s teams, among millions and millions of others, to work from home. The frustrations the team experienced while making the setup work led to one of Switch 2’s major features: GameChat.
“Back then, we were using a video conferencing system to check the software we were developing with our team, but the screen-sharing function built into the video conferencing system only allowed us to share one gameplay screen at a time,” Kawamoto says in the Ask the Developer interview. “So, we had each person place their game screen in front of their camera instead of their faces. When we did that, it felt like we were all in the same place, each bringing our own console to play the game together, which was a lot of fun. Based on this experience, we proposed adding a feature to Switch 2 where people can share their gameplay screen with other players.”
As demonstrated in a video Nintendo released on Thursday, GameChat looks and feels exactly like a Discord or Zoom call. After receiving a notification for a GameChat invite from a friend, a player simply hits the C button to open a multi-window grid that allows for the seamless continuation of play while peeking in on whatever their friends are playing and chatting back and forth. The sizzle reel shows up to four people participating in a call, playing games individually or together in multiplayer spaces likeSplatoon 3andMario Party Jamboree. Players speak to each other using the onboard console mic and can activate video usingthe new Switch 2 camera accessory. If for some reason a Switch 2 player needed to remain in their house without making human contact for two to 12 months, Nintendo has them covered on the socializing front.
In many ways, Nintendo is beyond late to the game. Discord is right there, but even before the ubiquitous social platform, Microsoft strove for a similar connection when it launched Skype integration for the Xbox One in 2013, allowing for a party-chat-like experience. Nintendo’s dream of bringing distant friends closer together during remote play also predates GameChat; the Wii had the Wii Speak mic accessory and thefew people who bought a Wii Uhad the ability to ring friends with Wii U Chat. But GameChat stands to be the cleanest collision of social and play on a console yet, and one with greater protection for kids thanks to Nintendo’s walled-off friend-list gardens. In the Switch 2 era, no distance will keep friends apart.
It’s a far cry from the vision for the original Switch. Nintendo revealed that console ina vibrant 2016 teaserthat highlighted the hybrid console’s on-the-go possibilities. Players could kick back on the couch to play the new Zelda, or they could also traverse Hyruleliterally anywhere else— in airports, in parks, huddled around a beer hall picnic table with friends. Those memories of “playing games together as children” were part of the Switch DNA too, with an emphasis on breaking down the living room walls. With the Switch 2, Nintendo has retreated back indoors, and wants us to lean in closer to the TV.
Nintendo hasn’t abandoned the hybrid nature of the console and it never will, but GameChat’s Zoom aesthetic is a jarring departure from the limitlessness of the 2016 Switch reveal. In Nintendo’s promo video for Switch 2, good-looking 20-somethings chill in each of their loft apartments, remotely chit-chatting with each other as one playsZelda: Echoes of Wisdomand another explains the inner workings ofUntitled Goose Game. In another vignette, a Japanese woman tells her three friends about a pizza place they once visited together in the outside world, which she has recreated inAnimal Crossing: New Horizons, a game which has no negative connotations to our social reality whatsoever.
Read the news, and you know Nintendo is making a smart call. Ashas been widely reported over the last year, the outbreak potential of H5N1, dubbed “bird flu,” looms as the virus jumps from avian species to mammals. The fear at this present juncture is not just that H5N1 couldevolve to affect a wider spread of humansthan just poultry and dairy workerswho contract it on farms, but that combating bird flu is looking more and more like a potential U.S. infrastructure failure. Scientists say bird fluhas been under-addressed on a political levelover the last few years, while the Trump administration’s mission tocut jobs in the health sectormay impact the meager work that is being done. When asked recently what should be done about the continued emergence of bird flu, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s top health official, suggestedletting it run its course through bird populations, which scientists seem to agree is a pretty terrible way of mitigating viral mutation.
That’s a lot of doom to erupt out of the introduction of Nintendo’s GameChat function, but then again, who could forget the time when GameChat would make the most sense? During my quarantine days in 2020, I spent an ungodly number of evenings playingMario Kart 8 Deluxeonline with a few non-gamer friends who lived just a few blocks away. Like the majority of people, the easiest way for us all to catch up face to face and talk a bit of smack as we swerved around Rainbow Road was to load up the Switch on the TV and a Zoom call on a laptop. With Switch 2, we’ll have GameChat. In a way, I pray we never have to use it.
There are less apocalyptic reasons GameChat is a tremendous advancement. There are families spread out around the state, the country, the world, who will come together to playKirby Air Ridersand feel closer than they ever would over a quick FaceTime check-in. The FromSoftware fans will have a helluva time screaming at each other asthey embark on whateverThe Duskbloodsturns out to be. All of that will happen from the comfort of home — the same home, the same walls, the same sofa, the inescapable familiar.
The global population might completely avoid H5N1 or whatever the next close call looks like. Nintendo isn’t taking a chance. It has built a console for socializing in solitary confinement that, thankfully, still has a handheld mode. I’ll be taking it outside while I can.

Nintendo won’t tell us how the Switch 2 Joy-Cons will avoid drift,2025-04-04T21:09:58Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553626/switch-2-joy-con-2-hall-effect-unconfirmed,"It’s unclear if the Switch 2 will utilize Hall-effect joysticks
byChelsea Stark
While Nintendo shared a lot about the hardware for theNintendo Switch 2during its April 2 Nintendo Direct and subsequent Treehouse streams, the company still won’t share the exact workings of the second iteration of Joy-Con or Pro Controller directional inputs. Specifically, fans have been wondering if the new analog sticks will useHall effect technology, which has been highly rumored and would help combat the drift issues that plagued the original Switch’s controllers.
As Polygon published this story,Nintendo Lifepublished confirmation from Nate Bihldorff, senior vice president of product development and publishing at Nintendo of America, that the Joy-Con 2 controllers do not contain Hall-effect sticks. Bihldorff wouldn’t say more, and there’s no word yet on theSwitch 2 Pro Controller’s sticks. Nintendo confirmed Bihldorff’s statement to Polygon later Monday.
Nintendo’s hardware developers, featured in the Nintendo Direct, were first asked this question during a large press briefing with over 100 outlets on Wednesday, April 2. A reporter from TechRadar asked if stick drift had been improved with the Joy-Con 2 and Pro Controller 2.
“As you may have witnessed and felt, the new Joy-Con 2 controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been really designed from the ground up from scratch and they’ve been designed to have bigger movements and also a smoother movement,” said Tetsuya Sasaki, general manager of Nintendo’s hardware development division, to the crowd via translator. He offered no additional follow-up, only asking the reporters assembled if they could feel the difference.
Polygon followed up in a translated interview with Nintendo’s hardware team the next day, asking if the Joy-Con would use magnets, which are a key component in Hall effect joysticks, so the sticks would have less wear and tear over time.
“It is true that we’ve rebuilt those as well from the ground up,” Sasaki reiterated. “We haven’t shared what the inner mechanisms are of those control sticks, and if I were to dive into it, it would basically be sharing the whole blueprint of the control stick. So it is a difficult question to answer.”
VGC got aslightlybetter answer, but one that doesn’t provide much clarity, either. “The control sticks for Joy-Con 2 controllers have been redesigned and have improved in areas such as durability,” a Nintendo spokesperson told the outlet.
But this is actually a topic players deserve an answer to. Polygon’s staff have sharedplentyof their ownfirsthandfrustrationswith Joy-Con drift, which usually causes whatever is being controlled to drift to the left, even if there’s no one touching the controller.
Hall-effect joysticks could solve this problem, as they utilize magnets and magnetic fields to register inputs, rather than physical contacts that could wear away over time. (My colleague Michael McWhertor wrote an excellent explainer onHall effect’s importance, with interviews from experts at iFixit, so please check that out for further reading.)
And Joy-Con drift has given Nintendo somewhat of a PR black eye, as it was hit with multipleclass-action lawsuitsover the issue in the U.S., though all have been dismissed. It also ledNintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa to apologizein a shareholder Q&A “for any trouble caused to our customers.”
It’s possible we won’t get an answer on Joy-Con 2’s internal workings until after the Switch 2 launches on June 5, and folks can start the teardown efforts widely.
Update:Nintendo Lifereports that the Joy-Con 2 controllers don’t feature Hall-effect joysticks. We’ve edited the story to include this.

"South of Midnight, Blue Prince, and the other new games out this week",2025-04-04T20:51:09Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/550720/best-new-game-releases-april-7-south-of-midnight-blue-prince,"This week is pure action and pure puzzle
byTyler Colp

The new game releases this week give you two choices: puzzles or action. There’s really no in between. Action fans get to fight monsters with magical powers inSouth of Midnightor take on intense multiplayer heists inMonaco 2. Puzzle fans get to explore an ever-changing mansion inBlue Princeor take the time to unravel the mysteries ofThe Talos Principle: Reawakened.
It’ll be a tough decision if you like both genres, because most of these games drop on the same day, but a few of them are less traditional than others.Star Overdrivesticks out in the action category as a game with monsters to fight but also hoverboard tricks to pull off. AndJumping Jazz Catsis a game where the action consists of an army of cats racing to complete minigames.
Here are our most anticipated game releases for the week of April 7.
Release date:April 8Platforms:Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis action game is steeped in folklore and set in the American Deep South. The world is infested with gruesome monsters that seem to be pain and trauma made manifest. Your job as Hazel, a magic-wielding Weaver, is to mend your community and hopefully find a place to call home yourself.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis pitch for this puzzle game is like nightmare mode for anyone in fear of getting stumped. It’s set in a mansion where the rooms and their puzzles change as each day passes. The goal is to find Room 46, but you’ll need to be extremely clever to keep up with the constantly shifting obstacles.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThey put the philosophical puzzle game into Unreal Engine 5. This updated version has all kinds of new stuff, including a new chapter in the story, quality-of-life improvements, and a tool to make puzzles yourself.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis co-op heist game requires teamwork and clever thinking. You get to play as unique characters with tools to overcome the various security measures and guards in your way. Each level is procedurally generated, too, so every run will be slightly different.
Release date:April 10Platforms:Nintendo SwitchTony Hawk’s Pro SkatermeetsNo Man’s Skyin this hoverboard action game. You get to ride around on alien planets, solve puzzles, and pull off tricks. And as if this game didn’t sound cool enough, you also fight enemies with a keytar.
Release date:April 10Platforms:Windows PCI’m not going to lie to you: I mostly chose this game simply because it’s calledJumping Jazz Cats. But it also looks pretty fun. You and up to eight other players get to run around and play minigames as little cats. Well, they’re called “minigames,” but they look more like a bunch of excuses to absolutely wreck the house of your absent owners.

Switch 2 continues the 20-year Nintendo tradition of not having achievements,2025-04-04T20:48:13Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements,"Achievements? Never heard of ‘em
byTyler Colp
TheSwitch 2won’t be joining the Xbox and PlayStation consoles with its own system-wide achievements, Nintendo confirmed to Polygon in a recent interview.
When we asked vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen if we can expect achievements, he gave a pretty clear answer: “Nope.”
Just like on Switch 1, it’ll be up to game developers to implement them in their own way. Ubisoft games, for example, have their own achievement system tied to Ubisoft Connect. When you earn them, they won’t show up on your Nintendo profile. And that’s not going to change with Switch 2.
But even though a traditional achievement system won’t exist, Nintendo is still experimenting with someachievement-like systemsin theSwitch 2 versions ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom. Both games will let you earn medals on the Nintendo Switch phone app. When you do things like travel long distances or collect a large number of rupees, those will be tracked inside the Zelda Notes part of the app, and you’ll be able to see how you compare against other players around the world.
That’s about as close as you’re going to get to achievements on Switch 2. Nintendo isn’t going to reward you for finishing first place as the cow inMario Kart World; that’ll be on you to celebrate when theSwitch 2 releases in June.

"Switch 2 still uses friend codes, but now they’re sort of optional",2025-04-04T20:00:10Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/553620/nintendo-switch-2-friend-codes-qr-codes,"Nintendo has discovered QR codes
byTyler Colp
Friend codes continue to exist onNintendo Switch 2, but adding people will be slightly easier than it was on Switch 1, Nintendo confirmed to Polygon in a recent interview.
The heart of the friends list system on Switch 2 remains the same as it was on Switch 1. That’s why you can transfer it to the new console without much fuss. But the unique string of numbers that you have to punch in for every person you add is now optional.
You can scan a QR code with the Nintendo Switch phone app instead, vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen told Polygon. You can add notes for every friend too, which can help you remember who they are if they change their username.
Trinen said these improvements were important to make because of things likeGameChat, Nintendo’s Discord-like voice and video chat app. GameChat only works with your friends and even has a dedicated C button on the right Joy-Con. Trinen says the way it “replicates that face-to-face experience you get in the same room is crucial for what we want out of a chat system.”
In other words, Switch 2 won’t revolutionize how you add friends on Nintendo’s online service. You won’t be able to search for someone’s username and tap a button. You will need to find some other way outside of the console to share your friend or QR code with someone. Maybe when the third iteration of Switch comes out, Nintendo will join every other social platform in making this process less of a pain. But it won’t be doing that with Switch 2, which is set to launchin June.

The Duskbloods trades FromSoft’s sweet maidens for an ‘elderly gentleman’ rat,2025-04-04T17:15:03Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553390/duskbloods-maiden-winged-rat-hidetaka-miyazaki,"‘We tried doing something a little Nintendo-esque’

The Duskbloodswill be a departure forElden RingandDark Soulsdeveloper FromSoftware in more ways than one. In addition tofocusing on PvPvE multiplayer actionfor the Switch 2 exclusive,The Duskbloodswill apparently do away with the traditional, doll-like maidens that FromSoftware features in its games.
In their place? A nice, old winged rat.
Game directorHidetaka Miyazaki says in an interview with Nintendothat, like the focus on eight-player multiplayer, he wanted to try something new forThe Duskbloods’ equivalent of the Dark Souls Fire Keeper. Asked about the “winged rat character” seen at the end of the trailer for FromSoft’s new game, Miyazaki says, “That character shares a similar role with the fire keepers from the Dark Souls series. They remain in the hub area, providing the player with advice and guidance.”
Miyazaki says that the developer “tried doing something a little Nintendo-esque in the spirit of the partnership” with that character.
“We tried something cute for a change,” Miyazaki explains. “Although I will say this character is actually an elderly gentleman.”
That’s quite a change for FromSoft, which has thus far populated its games with comely and mysterious women who serve as guides for the player. (SeeDemon’s Souls’ Maiden in Black,Dark Souls’ various Fire Keepers,Dark Souls 2’s Emerald Herald,Dark Souls 3’s Fire Keeper,Bloodborne’s The Doll,Sekiro’s Emma, andElden Ring’s Melina and Ranni the Witch, for examples.)
Perhaps Miyazaki has found the value in elderly gentlemen as player guides for his games, based on the positive response toElden Ring’s Miriel, Pastor of Vows, otherwise known as the “Pope Turtle.” It is nice to mix things up now and then.
The Duskbloodswill be released on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026.

It’s nice to see Switch 2 get GameCube games that are hard to get in real life,2025-04-04T16:02:48Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/552446/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-gamecube-games-fire-emblem-wind-waker,"No more shelling out big bucks just to play some great games
byIan Walker
When the Switch 2 arrives on June 5, it will do so with updated Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack offerings featuring GameCube titles as part of the service’s classics library, providing access to some hard-to-find and/or prohibitively expensive games in the process.
The initial GameCube offerings include all-time greatsThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Soulcalibur 2, andF-Zero GX, but things getreallyinteresting when you peruse the rest of the lineup. The group of Nintendo Switch Online GameCube games teased for the future —Super Mario Sunshine,Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance,Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness,Super Mario Strikers,Chibi-Robo, andLuigi’s Mansion— is comprised of arguable dark horse candidates for the best games on the console. That said, some of them can also be costly, and that’s only if you manage to find someone willing to sell.
Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, for instance, was the first 3D entry in the tactical roleplaying series and is often ranked by fans — alongside its direct Wii sequel,Radiant Dawn— among the best gameplay and storytelling the franchise has to offer. I was forced to play andalmostbeat both via successive rentals from my local Hollywood Video and never owned copies of my own. Unfortunately for anyone wanting to experience this wonderful game secondhand, however, it can be pretty difficult to find in the wild. Resell prices arecurrently hovering around $160for a loose disc or sometimes even over $200 if you want a complete-in-box copy.
Did Nintendo target these games on purpose? It’s still unclear, and their appearance on Nintendo Switch Online probably won’t do anything to lower their cost anyway. But for folks who just want to play the games rather than treat them as collectors items or investments, the Switch 2 could be a godsend. And, sure, while you can technically emulate older games, sometimes you just want a legitimate way to sit down with an old game without having to get your hands dirty trolling shady download sites and worrying about optimal program settings. Now all we have to contend with is the frankly random way in which the service adds games to its classic libraries.

Nintendo delays Switch 2 pre-orders in response to Trump tariffs,2025-04-04T14:49:48Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553133/pre-orders-delayed-trump-tariff,"Proposed tariffs could raise prices by nearly 50%
byMichael McWhertor
Nintendo has delayed pre-orders in the United States for theSwitch 2in response to sweeping new tariffs outlined by the Trump administration earlier this week.Pre-orders were scheduled to begin on April 9, but have been delayed indefinitely, Nintendo said Friday.
Switch 2’s release datein the U.S. is still set for June 5.
“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,” Nintendo said in a statement provided to Polygon. “Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”
Nintendoannounced its next-generation consoleon Wednesday, setting theprice of Switch 2at $449.99. A few hours later, U.S. President Donald Trumpannounced “reciprocal tariffs” on dozens of countries, including territories where Nintendo manufactures its hardware. Trump hit China with an additional 34% duty on Wednesday, and hit Vietnam, where Nintendo has moved some of its production, with a 46% tariff. That could mean Switch 2’s already expensive price tag could go up even further for customers in the U.S.
Response to Nintendo’s prices for Switch 2 and games — which cost upward of $79.99 — for the system have been widely negative. During livestreams broadcast by Nintendo on Thursday and Friday, viewers unrelentingly spammed one request to the company: “Drop the price!” But with Trump escalating a trade war with double-digit tariffs on imported goods, it seems unlikely customers in the U.S. will see a price drop.
It’s unclear at this stage what the result of Nintendo’s assessment of Trump’s tariffs and “evolving market conditions” will ultimately mean for the launch of Switch 2. But in addition to increased costs, it could also mean a lower allocation of consoles for the U.S., which could make the system harder to find.

The Nintendo Switch 2 significantly cuts down Breath of the Wild’s load times,2025-04-04T14:37:11Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/552759/load-speeds-time-botw-fast-travel,"Time to go back to the Korok Forest
byRuss FrushtickandSimone de Rochefort
Nintendo isdipping its toes into the hardware warwith its new console. The Switch 2 will supportDLSS technology and ray tracing, and it’ll launch withSwitch 2 editionsof its flagship Legend of Zelda Switch titles,Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom.
But what do these hardware upgrades actually get you?
We had a limited time with the Nintendo Switch 2 at the New York preview event, but we putBreath of the Wildto a simple test. How long does it take to fast-travel from Lanaryu Tower to the Shrine of Resurrection on the Switch 2, versus the original Switch?
When Link fast travels, he whooshes away in a stream of light, and then the game cuts to a loading screen. And it stays there.
By our math, that’s roughly a 35% improvement, and nothing to sneeze at. It’s no PS4 to PS5 jump, but the wait is noticeably shorter than it used to be. And any reduction in the time I’m spending staring at my reflection in the Switch’s screen is a win for me.
What’s more, we played a sequence in the Korok Forest, which wasnotoriously laggy on the original Nintendo Switch. In our demo of the Switch 2, we didn’t run into any of the same performance issues, with it maintaining a silky 60FPS throughout.
The Switch 2 will bemore expensive than Nintendo fans are used to paying, but at least in terms of performance, there are some real improvements.

Why FromSoft is all in on multiplayer with Switch 2 game The Duskbloods,2025-04-04T14:24:03Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553022/duskbloods-pvpve-from-software-interview-multiplayer,"Game director Hidetaka Miyazaki wants to try something new with PvPvE
byMichael McWhertor
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Dark Souls developer FromSoftware surprised fans — and perplexed some — withthis week’s reveal of a new competitive multiplayer gamefor Switch 2,The Duskbloods. AlongsideElden Ring Nightreign, it’s the second multiplayer-forward game coming from the studio, which is best-known for its immersive role-playing games.
But there’s a reason whyThe Duskbloodsdirector Hidetaka Miyazaki is focusing heavily on competitive multiplayer. In anew interview with Nintendo, the game director and FromSoftware president says, “I’ve always found the PvPvE structure very interesting. It allows for a broad range of game-design ideas, while also letting us leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters.”
Miyazaki unpacks those game design ideas in the interview, saying that the playable characters inThe Duskbloods, which are known as Bloodsworn, have abilities that lend themselves to multiplayer action, including dashes, double jumps, and long-range attacks.
The Duskbloods’ setting, he says, “allows for the depiction of firearms and such, and every character is equipped with some means of attacking from a distance. I feel this is one of the game’s unique aspects when compared with our previous titles. I hope these new action elements are one area that players will enjoy.”
The eight-player PvPvE structure ofThe Duskbloodswill follow a last-player standing rule set, for the most part. But the win conditions in the game’s multiplayer matches vary; players may need to eliminate a specific player or team up with another to take down a boss. Or, they may receive new orders from that creepy moon with wings seen in the game’s reveal trailer.
Miyazaki says that, like past FromSoftware titles, “We’ve therefore designed the PvE boss encounters to present a tough challenge and a sense of accomplishment upon defeating them.”
He also confesses to being “not much of a PvP person,” explaining thatThe Duskbloods’ boss battles should satisfy the FromSoftware fans who come to their games for PvE. “Regardless of whether it’s PvP or PvE, the idea is to provide players with an experience that allows them to learn and hone their skills as they play,” Miyazaki says.
Miyazaki also acknowledges the PvP haters, promising that FromSoftware is not retreating from the tough, single-player focused games that made the studio a household name. “[The Duskbloods] is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward,“ Miyazaki says. “We still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as [Elden Ring] that embrace our more traditional style.“
FromSoftware’sElden Ringis coming to Switch 2 sometime in 2025 with an updated Tarnished Edition.The Duskbloodswill be released in 2026.

Where are all the first-party Switch 2 launch games?,2025-04-03T21:09:47Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/552601/switch-2-game-release-first-party-strategy,"﻿It turns out they’re hiding in plain sight
byOli Welsh
During anhourlong presentation on Wednesday, Nintendo bombarded prospective Switch 2 buyers with information about the new console and its games, including a torrent of ports from third-party publishers. But, once the dust had settled, it was easy to succumb to a creeping anxiety. Where were all the first-party launch titles from Nintendo itself?Mario Kart Worldlooks great, but isit $79.99 great?
Yes and no. Depending on how you define a launch game — and how you define a Switch 2 game — the Switch 2 will launch with anywhere between one and nine Nintendo games. You don’t have to expand these definitions to the absolute limit to realize that the Switch 2 is launching with relatively strong first-party support compared to Nintendo’s past systems. But it is true that Nintendo is approaching this launch a little differently.
First, a little historical perspective: In the last 20 years or so, new Nintendo consoles have launched with only two or three first-party games. For example, the Switch hadThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,1-2-Switch, andSnipperclips, a small eShop game. Further back, the Wii had the admittedly killerZelda: Twilight PrincessandWii Sportsdouble-header; the DS the more dubious pairing ofSuper Mario 64 DSandMetroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt.
In terms of Nintendo-made exclusive games, the Switch 2 has two titles on day one:Mario Kart WorldandNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour. But the latter is a download-only virtual guide to the hardware that most people wouldn’t consider a full launch title. So yes, compared to previous systems, it looks a little light.
But considerDonkey Kong Bananza, which is set for release on July 17 — just six weeks after the launch of the console. This is clearly a major new Nintendo platformer, and given what we know about Nintendo’s conservative approach to finishing games and setting launch dates, it seems likely the game would be ready to hit the June 5 launch day if Nintendo wanted it to. (It could well be finished already.)
It’s probable that Nintendo shiftedBananza’s launch date back as a deliberate marketing strategy, perhaps to extend the hype window beyond launch, perhaps to cover a second wave of stock. Or perhaps out of concern thatMario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananzamight cannibalize each other if launched together, because they’re both major titles. This is a key point. If we considerBananzaa launch title, and I think it’s only right to, then the Switch 2 is launching with two brand-new, exclusive Nintendo games of the highest order — which is arguably a first.
First-party support for Switch 2 goes even further when you considerSwitch 2 Editionsof existing Switch games. The system launches withenhanced versionsofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom, followed quickly in July bySuper Mario Party Jamboree, which has received a pretty extensive update tailored to the console’s GameChat features and camera. In August, Nintendo will release an expanded version ofKirby and the Forgotten Landwith a whole new storyline. Some of these upgrades, especially the Mario Party and Kirby releases, seem substantial enough to be compared to the Deluxe Switch versions of Wii U games likeMario Kart 8andNew Super Mario Bros. U.
(You can only get to nine first-party launch games by including the threeGameCube reissues, exclusive to Switch 2, on Nintendo Switch Online:The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Soulcalibur 2, andF-Zero GX. This is pushing it, I admit, although I would bet these will be some of my most-played games in my first weeks with the new console.)
Through the rest of 2025, we’ll getDrag x Drive,Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,Kirby Air Riders, and Switch 2 Editions ofMetroid Prime 4: BeyondandPokémon Legends: Z-A. All in all, across Switch 2 exclusives and Switch 2 Editions, Nintendo announced 12 titles coming in 2025 during Wednesday’s Direct.
That’s a lot of games by any measure. (Certainly compared to the first-party support given to Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 in their first nine months on the market.) It just looks different, partly because Nintendo is choosing to spread out its release dates, and partly because Switch 2 Editions are a more diffuse concept than the ports and remasters that have been Nintendo’s stock-in-trade on previous consoles. Nintendo is certainly hedging its bets a little with two of its biggest 2025 games,Metroid Prime 4: BeyondandPokémon Legends: Z-A, also coming to the Switch. But however you cut it, Switch 2 first-party support is a lot stronger than it might have seemed at first.

The Switch 2 mouse does work on pants… and lots of other things,2025-04-03T19:36:33Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/552594/switch-2-joy-con-mouse-controller-test-hands-on,"A rigorous experiment with Nintendo’s new controllers
byChelsea Stark
There’s a lot to talk about since theSwitch 2 reveal, and one of the jokey-but-not questions from many folks is:Will the Switch 2 mouse work on my pants?
Which makes sense! Rarely are we doing handheld or console gaming with a table in front of us, let alone a large, luxurious desk mat like the ones at theNintendo Switch 2hands-on event held in New York. I already wrote a bit onhow it feels to play with the Joy-Con’s mouse feature, but let’s get specific: How well does it work on pants? And various other non-mousepad surfaces?
The mouse worked on my corduroy pants no problem, both while aiming duringMetroid Prime 4: Beyond, and when using both Joy-Cons during the strangeDrag x Drivegame. I had to drag both hands across my legs at once to drive the robot wheelchair, but it did work!But I couldn’t just stop there. Urged on by coworkers back home, I tried the mouse on basically any surface I had access to. Does the mouse work on the bare skin of my arm? Yup. The aluminum back of my Macbook Air? Yup. A leather wallet? The only limiting factor there was the surface being small, but the mouse worked.
I asked my friend and former Polygon stafferMegan Farohkmanesh, who confirmed it also worked on her tights. Finally, I tried to use the mouse on the top of my head, for a stunt nobody would actually repeat while gaming. Did it work? Yes. I’m sure TikTok loves this footage.
So generally, will it mouse? Yes. Should it? Probably not, but you can’t doubt my commitment to the bit.

Is Nintendo making a mistake by charging for upgraded Switch 2 titles?,2025-04-03T17:22:47Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/552300/switch-2-edition-upgrade-cost-question,"﻿It hasn’t gone well for Sony. But Nintendo’s strategy is a bit different
byOli Welsh
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
During Wednesday’sSwitch 2 Direct, Nintendo revealed that some games for the original Switch could be upgraded to enhancedSwitch 2 Editionsby purchasing an upgrade pack. This isn’t surprising, coming from a company that has long loved to repackage old games for new consoles and sell them to fans a second (or third, or fourth) time. But it left some observers feeling that Nintendo was nickel-and-diming its fans — and it’s a strategy that comes with risks.
When launching a console that’sfully backward-compatible with its predecessor’s games, console makers have some tricky choices to make. One of the trickiest involves how to handle pricing and upgrades when there are versions of the same game for both platforms — particularly if the platform holder is increasing the price of games on the new system (as Nintendo is).
Both Sony and Microsoft were faced with this conundrum when they launched their most recent consoles, and they made very different choices. Microsoft’s policy is both generous and simple: Any Xbox One games are upgraded to Xbox Series X editions automatically and at no extra cost. If you own the newer console, you can rest easy that you are always playing the best version of the game without thinking about it, and without shelling out for it.
Sony’s policy is a bit less generous, and much more confusing. Some upgrades from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5 versions of games are free. (Quite a few, to be fair.) Many are not; it costs $10 to upgrade a copy ofMarvel’s Spider-ManorGrand Theft Auto 5to the PS5 version, for example. Sometimes this upgrade path was only available for a limited time. Sometimes it’s not available at all, and your only option, if you already own the game on PS4, is to buy it all over again on PS5.
Understandably, this messy, costly system didn’t go down well with PlayStation players. WhenHorizon Forbidden Westwas announced with no upgrade path, fans were so upset that Sony was forced to back down,offer a free upgrade, and pledge to always offer upgrades in the future (albeit for a price). This is the minefield that Nintendo is now stepping into.
There are a few caveats, however. Firstly, Nintendo did not announce pricing for its upgrade packs, and how players feel about the upgrades will depend to a large extent on where this pricing lands. Also, will the upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which improves performance and comes with somecompanion-app features, cost the same as theSwitch 2upgrade forKirby and the Forgotten Land, which adds a whole new expansion to the game? Maybe, maybe not. To complicate things further, theSwitch 2 Edition upgrades forBreath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomwill be included in a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription, but others won’t.
That’s not all. Nintendo is also offering asecond tier of free Switch 2 patchesfor games likeSuper Mario OdysseyandPokémon ScarletandViolet. These don’t count as full Switch 2 Editions, but they will “improve playability” and “may improve performance or add support for features such asGameShare,” depending on the game.
As with PS5, it’s quite a confusing picture — especially since we don’t yet know pricing, or how third-party publishers will choose to handle Switch 2 Editions. (On PlayStation, many — if not most — opted to offer free upgrades.) But there is one important factor that distinguishes Nintendo’s strategy from Sony’s.
The only enhancements offered by many PS5 upgrades were in terms of visuals and performance: higher resolutions and frame rates, ray-traced lighting, or new performance and quality modes. Players felt they were being asked to spend $10 per game to unlock the power of the console they had already bought.
Nintendo seems to have a policy that visual upgrades aren’t enough for a Switch 2 Edition. The Zelda games come with the (admittedly not very compelling) Zelda Notes companion features.Super Mario Party Jamboreehas a new play mode, and makes extensive use of Switch 2 features like mouse controls and the camera.Kirby and the Forgotten Landhas a whole new story.Metroid Prime 4: Beyondhas mouse controls. It seems clear that Nintendo always wants to add value in a Switch 2 Edition, either through additional content, use of the Switch 2’s unique features (beyond its increased processing power), or both. Some of these releases — Kirby and Mario Party especially — would seem to be on a par with the Switch’s Deluxe editions of Wii U games likeMario Kart 8andNew Super Mario Bros. U. (There’s one exception to this rule: The Switch 2 Edition ofPokémon Legends: Z-Adoes not feature any upgrades beyond a visual one, at least for now.)
That should make the upgrade pack cost, however much it may be, easier to stomach. (Charging for upgrade packs will surely make all that extra development time easier for Nintendo to stomach.) It’s a fairer proposition than Sony’s, if hardly a less confusing one. But Xbox owners — and PC gamers, for that matter, who never have to worry about such things — would be justified in feeling quite smug by comparison.

Perhaps one of the more unexpected announcements to arrive out of the Nintendo Switch Direct is that theNintendo Switch 2will have a camera peripheral to supplement the console’s new group chat feature. While the Switch 2 will be compatible withthird-party USB-C webcams, the peripheral manufacturers at Hori are already producing their own adorable version of a camera for the Switch 2 modeled after the Piranha Plant.
Specifics surrounding the carnivorous camera are a bit slim. It isn’t currently advertised on the manufacturer’s website, and it has only been spotted in the wild at European retailerMediamarkt, which has the product listed for around $44, about $6 cheaper than thefirst-party model advertised by Nintendo. It appears that the stem will be detachable from the base and is flexible, to ensure you have the best possible angle. However, the coolest feature is that its mouth can be closed as a privacy shutter for the camera when not in use. Nintendo’s official camera for the Switch 2 has a similar feature, but I’m glad we’re already starting to see weird peripherals for the new console taking root.

It name-dropped a lot of features that are commonly tossed around in the world of PC gaming. For one, the Switch 2’s 7.9-inch 1080p LCD display has G-Sync support baked in, and its variable refresh rate (VRR) support will ensure that you won’t notice fluctuations in frame rate as easily. Nvidia shared that the Switch 2 has “10x the graphical performance of the Nintendo Switch,” and that it uses DLSS to upscale graphics in games. Also, developers will be able to take advantage of ray tracing in the Switch 2.

Nintendo held off announcing the price of theSwitch 2in its bigSwitch 2 Directon Wednesday. Instead, perhaps in preparation for the inevitable sticker shock, the $449 price point was slipped into a news release tucked away in a bevy of other facts. Nintendo also announced that a limited-supply bundle that comes with a copy ofMario Kart Worldwould retail for $499.99. The Mario Kart sequel runs $80 as a standalone game.
Even with rampant inflation of the U.S. economy, theSwitch 2 remains one of Nintendo’s most expensive consoles ever. Further, it’s crossing theonce-sacred $70 price pointfor games — a relatively ubiquitous price for AAA games that most major studios generally adhere to. (That price point has crept up over the years, with first-party Switch 1 games going for $60 in most cases.)
In the wake of Nintendo’s pricey announcements, we’ve seen reactionsfrom folks all across the internet, and even in our own personal group chats with friends, land all over the place. In January, wepredicted that the console would be sold at $399, and in our reader survey, almost 57% of you agreed with us. Just 9% of our respondents predicted that the Switch 2 would cost $449. So now the question stands: Will you buy a Switch 2 for $449.99?
With Switch 2 pre-orders set for April 9, the Nintendo Switch 1still retails for $299.99— the same price as when it launched. The Switch OLED stillgoes for $349.99, and has also never been discounted. A Switch Lite continuesto go for $199.99. Nintendo’s Switch 2competitors, like theValve Steam Deckand theROG Ally X, retail for anywhere from $399 to just under $600, depending on how much storage you’d like.
So tell us: Will you buy the Switch 2? Vote in our poll and sound off in the comments to make your case.

"Switch 2 won’t kill your hands like Switch 1, but it ain’t perfect",2025-04-03T12:47:59Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551854/switch-2-hands-on-review,"Testing the ergonomics of Nintendo’s new console
byRuss Frushtick
If you were handed aNintendo Switch 2, you might not initially realize it. Sure, it might feel a little bigger in the hand, but otherwise the experience of holding Nintendo’s long-awaited follow-up feels familiar, with all the pluses and minuses that go along with that.
Delving a bit deeper, though, the improvements do become apparent. You just have to hunt for them.
When in handheld mode, the Switch 2 is about an inch wider and a half-inch taller than the original Switch. This increased size allows the Joy-Con 2 controllers to hug the new 7.9-inch screen, which is also noticeably bigger than the original Switch’s 6.2-inch display. While playingMario Kart World, I really appreciated the increased screen real estate, allowing me to soak up the image of a cow on a motorcycle doing backflips over Donkey Kong. But I was surprised to find that the increased size really helped with the ergonomics of the device as well.
It’s no secret that the original Nintendo Switch was a one-way ticket to Hand Cramptown. I can’t say that the Switch 2 will alleviate all of the issues people had when playing games in handheld mode, but I have some hope. Because the Joy-Con 2 controllers are a bit longer, I was able to fully grip the controller without my pinkie and ring fingers dangling uselessly under the console. More fingers on the device itself means more support and therefore less wrist and hand strain when playing for long periods of time.
Unfortunately, this is entirely subjective, and someone with smaller hands might not have the same experience. In fact, Polygon’s Chelsea Stark felt that the comfort levels were pretty comparable between the original Switch and the Switch 2, but did note that she really felt the weight difference — the Switch 2 is about 34% heavier, weighing 1.18 pounds with both Joy-Cons attached.
I found the increased size of the new Joy-Cons to be beneficial in other ways. If you’ve ever played a multiplayer game using a single Joy-Con tilted on its side, you understand misery. On the Switch 2, that experience is measurably improved on a few fronts: For one, the added size makes it so the buttons and analog stick aren’t right on top of each other, and your hands aren’t quite so smashed together as they were when holding the teeny-tiny original Joy-Con. The tiny, rectangular trigger buttons in this solo Joy-Con mode are also elevated and far easier to press on the Joy-Con 2, so drifting inMario Kart Worldwill be that much more viable in this setting. Is it as good as holding your own dedicated controller? It is not. It still feels weird and offset, a consequence of the Joy-Con having to work for both handheld and solo play, but it’ll work in a pinch.
Size improvements have also been made to the analog sticks and face buttons, which are slightly larger than they were before. When using Joy-Con 2s in the new grip controller, it didn’t feel like I was totally hamstrung not having a full Pro Controller, like I would have been with the original Switch’s grip. I still don’t think I’d want to play a 60-hour Zelda adventure using just the grip — mostly because swapping between the right analog stick and face buttons still feels unnatural because of the way they’re stacked — but it might allow me to eke out some more play time before having to call it quits.
There are also more subtle differences that make using the Switch 2 far more enjoyable than the original. Connecting a Joy-Con 2 to the device using the new magnetic attachment feels incredible, as it clicks securely into place without the slight wiggle you might have felt with the original Switch’s rail system. There’s also a significantly stronger rumble hiding within the Switch, capable of boosting the feedback with a lot more fervor than before.
But with these improvements, it’s hard not to feel like there’s a pretty significant downgrade in comfort and playability when sticking with the stock Joy-Con 2s over, say, the new Switch 2 Pro Controller. If you play a lot of games, it does feel like the Pro Controller will be a mandatory purchase. Thanks to the new kickstand and the larger screen size, tabletop play does become a much more viable option than before. (It’s a good thing the Switch 2 will bebackward-compatible with the original Switch Pro Controller.)
After eight years, I was hoping more would have been done to make the ergonomics of the Switch 2 a dramatic improvement. The goal of allowing the Joy-Con 2s to function in a variety of circumstances (attached to the tablet, in one hand, sideways as a mini controller, and even as a mouse), probably has a significant impact on making something comfortable to hold for long periods of time. Which is to say: Third-party accessory manufacturers will once again swoop in with all sorts of zany grip solutions to make the Switch 2 a cushier experience. It’s just a shame that Nintendo wasn’t able to solve all of these problems on its own.

Using the Switch 2’s Joy-Con mouse is only kind of like using a mouse,2025-04-03T12:36:35Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551761/joy-con-switch-2-mouse-hands-on-review,"We played Metroid Prime 4 with a Joy-Con mouse. Here’s what that’s like

We played Metroid Prime 4 with a Joy-Con mouse. Here’s what that’s like
byChelsea Stark
Nintendo announced that its Switch 2 Joy-Cons could beused as a mouse— in either hand, even — during itsSwitch 2 Directon April 2. Mice and other pointers have been aiding in making certain game movements more precise for decades, so the idea of a console-based mouse is tempting, if it’s implemented well.
During a hands-on event in New York City on Wednesday, I was able to test the Joy-Cons’ mouse mode on a few different gameplay experiences specifically designed to highlight it. Nintendo is a company known for unique (or sometimes gimmicky) implementations of control schemes, yet the mouse has had decades of refinement for computer gaming. Some of the experiences I had using the Joy-Con as a mouse felt traditional, but some left me scratching my head as to whether they would receive wider adoption.
The new Joy-Con — called Joy-Con 2 — has been given extra heft and sturdiness compared to the first iteration. They fill my hands a bit more comfortably without being too much wider. When I’m sliding them on their sides, it doesn’t seem like they will accidentally tip over. I found that the mouse could also register on different types of surfaces; while Nintendo provided nice, cushy, desk-sized mouse pads to use during demos, I also triedsliding the mouse up and down my corduroy pantsto simulate “gamer conditions” of playing in the wild. There really wasn’t too much of a difference, as long as the surface was wide enough to handle a mouse swipe.
For a demo ofMetroid Prime 4:Beyond, I used the mouse (while standing at a desk, which felt slightly awkward!) to gun down enemies. The movement felt mostly comparable to that of any first-person shooter I’ve played on a computer — although in PC games, mouse controls aren’t usually paired with the lock-on technology Samus still uses inBeyond. But it did feel fairly natural to aim and look around with the Joy-Con mouse. This was slightly complicated by the fact that the face buttons were now rotated, so finding the right one was less intuitive while trying to scan doors, fire missiles, or activate Samus’ morph ball mode. I felt like I was constantly hitting the wrong button during my demo because of the adjustment.
The end of theMetroid Prime 4demo featured a boss covered in glowing weak spots for which I couldn’t use the auto lock-on, meaning I had to rely on the mouse’s precision aiming — or lack thereof, due to the removal of lock-on mechanics — to take it down. I wonder how much this will feature in the full game, and if the Switch 2 version of the game will highlight the mouse more than the Switch version.
Meanwhile, inDrag x Drive, using the Joy-Con as a mouse was less about aiming and precision and more about endlessly sliding it. In a game that feels meant to highlight Switch 2 features rather than be fun, I was endlessly swiping with both hands to build speed as a little robot wheelchair user, then swiping one or the other Joy-Con mouse to turn. The idea is easy to understand, but despite it feeling like a smaller-scale version of rowing, I struggled for a bit to figure out how to move smoothly. Thankfully, throwing passes to my teammates or making baskets felt very generous, because most of my time withDrag x Drivewas spent just on mastering movement. It’s hard for me to envision setting this game up in a room with the amount of space I might need for the mouse movements, even if I could use my legs instead of a flat surface.
I’m so curious to see this concept extended to other games beyond these demos, as a mouse has so much potential for console gaming. But it might require dedicated resources for developers to figure out how to best implement the Switch 2’s mouse functionality — it’s really not like anything else out there, since it can work in either (or even both) of the user’s hands but will still need to accommodate button presses on the Joy-Con as well.

My favorite part of Switch 2’s Mario Kart was before the race started,2025-04-03T12:36:11Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/552191/mario-kart-world-impressions-switch-2,"Though the racing is pretty good, too
byChelsea Stark
Mario Kart Worldanswers the question, “How do you followMario Kart 8?” While the previous entry became fully stuffed with new and throwback racetracks, playingMario Kart Worldat Nintendo’s hands-onSwitch 2preview event blew up all my assumptions of what a Mario Kart track can be — and what the future could hold for the franchise.
The arcade racer hasn’t yet strayed from its format, but that’s about to change whenMario Kart Worldis released alongside the Switch 2 on June 5. In the time I spent withMario Kart Worldduring the preview event, I most enjoyed all the times I wasn’t strictly racing. I was just driving and vibing.
We loaded up for a massive game of Knock-out Tour, where 24 folks compete in a marathon-style race across ever-changing terrain. But because I happened to be one of the first to pick up a console, I spent a long time waiting for everyone else — but not idly. Instead, I was able to drive wherever I wanted across the landscape.
First, I drifted down a snowy road, feeling how my heavy car’s tires dug in the deeper snow off the track. I vaulted across a ramp, soaring longer and farther than I ever had in a Mario Kart game before. I weaved through busy highways, which were a mix of normal vehicles and some extra-large Nintendo variants, some spewing gold coins in their wake. I even whipped around quickly and drove against traffic to get a closer look at a mushroom diner sign that I had missed on my last pass by.
As an aside:Mario Kart Worldseems packed with Nintendo nostalgia, and primed for poring over by superfans. The world is full of small Easter eggs you might not see while racing by, or other drivers you may pass on the road. (I yelled in delight when I got passed by the penguin fromMario 64!) But in Knock-out Tour, I had the option to take roads at my own pace, which feels luxurious, instead of throwing a race for the sake of seeing some detail.
Comparisons toForza Horizon 5seem apt, as it feels like I’m just cruising around until the event starts. While there may not be as robust driving options — Mario Kart is still an arcadey game! — I enjoyed the drive. I wanted to see what was around the next bend, with so many terrain and track types merging together seamlessly.
It also takes off the pressure of responding to items or dealing with the actual race. One of my longstanding criticisms of Mario Kart is how it isn’t always your fault if you lose, and that’s still true on the extremely long Knock-out Tour. I was knocked out pretty early — partially my fault for picking a character based on aesthetics. (Sorry to the beefcake biker version of Bowser; you’re very heavy!)
But it did make me curious and excited to try out the Free Roam mode advertised in Wednesday’s Direct, which seems to offer a lot more variety in driving. (You’ll also drive between courses in a cup, but the hands-on demos only rotated me through single tracks.)
There are so many other things to appreciate: the weird new items, which I haven’t seen all of yet; thesurprisingly deep bench of charactersavailable as drivers. But I can’t wait to cruise around uninhibited and take them in at my own pace.

"Switch 2 Zelda upgrades have achievements, weird GPS voice assistant",2025-04-02T23:51:24Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/552070/switch-2-zelda-notes-app-tears-of-the-kingdom-breath-of-the-wild,"Several new features are tied to a phone app
byTyler Colp
On top of the improved graphical performance for theSwitch 2 versions ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom, there will be a suite of new features in the Nintendo Switch phone app, including an achievement system and, strangely, a voice navigation assistant.
The new service inside the Switch app is called Zelda Notes. It only works for theSwitch 2versions, and is “designed to provide a more streamlined gameplay experience,” according to theoverview trailer.
The app has achievement-like medals you can earn for doing things like traveling long distances, defeating enemies, collecting rupees, and other metrics. Medals are tracked globally and you can view what other players have earned compared to yourself in the app, too.
All I can say is that it’s a very Nintendo move to add achievements to only two Switch 2 games that exist solely on a service inside of an app. You could speculate on whether this means Nintendo is gearing up to finally make its own version of achievements in the year 2025, but we all know within ourselves that this is probably a weird one-off thing we’ll never see again.
Another major feature of Zelda Notes is voice navigation, which looks a lot like a GPS assistant that can tell you where to find things like Koroks, Skyview Towers, Shrines, and more. In the short demo, a player selects a map icon on their phone and the voice calls out directions to a Korok hidden under a rock inTears of the Kingdom.
To me, it’s an odd feature to include for two open-world games about the joys of exploring and discovering things. There’s no shame in using guides when you’re stumped, but I’m not sure these games would be as much fun if you spent the entire time being told where to go. It makes more sense to use it for finding something in a pinch or cleaning up what you missed. Honestly, I’m having trouble trying to think of who Nintendo thinks this is for.
One of the things you can use the navigation assistant to find are a bunch of new voice memories from Zelda, King Rauru, and Master Kohga. These short audio diaries are scattered around the world and let you hear the characters’ thoughts on locations and moments in Hyrule’s history. All the Zelda lore heads out there will have a new reason to boot up their old save files.
The app also lets you share blueprints for yourTears of the Kingdombuilds — a feature that would’ve been nice two years ago — as well as gift items to other players, edit screenshots, roll for small daily in-game bonuses, and get rewards for scanning amiibo.
The Zelda Notes service will go live inside the Nintendo Switch app on June 5, the same daythe Switch 2 launches, along with the upgraded versions ofBreath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom.

Donkey Kong Bananza is not just Mario Odyssey with a gorilla,2025-04-02T23:37:58Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/552075/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-impressions,"Apparently Donkey Kong is basically the Hulk
byRuss Frushtick
While watching the bigNintendo Switch 2 Direct, I’m sure I wasn’t alone in expecting the long-awaited follow-up toSuper Mario Odyssey. When the final trailer kicked off with lush, cartoony environs, it seemed clear that the expectation was about to become reality. But nope, Nintendo’s big surprise game was actuallyDonkey Kong Bananza, a new 3D adventure game starring the king of the Kongs.
But is this just a palette swap? Maybe the developers wanted to make a new 3D platformer, but to mix it up they slotted in Donkey Kong instead of Mario. Effectively, is this the sequel toMario Odysseywe’ve been waiting for?
Big time not.
After having spent 30 minutes playing the game at Nintendo’s press event Wednesday, I can say thatDonkey Kong Bananzamight be the most “fuck everything up” game Nintendo has ever made. Seconds into controlling Donkey Kong, I was set loose in a mine staffed by very sad chimpanzees. And no, I wasn’t there to save them. Apparently this next generation of DK is very obsessed with Bananium, a mineral that looks a heck of a lot like gold and I guess tastes like bananas.
The gameplay consists of Donkey Kong just sprinting through the mine breaking literally everything around him. He’s busting holes in walls, he’s throwing huge boulders — he’s a very mobile, very hungry wrecking ball. There was very little platforming involved, in fact, with much more of a focus on wrecking shit. Every button and trigger but one results in some wrecking-shit variant. There’s the standard horizontal punch, there’s a ground slam, there’s a ground drum (for sending nearby pickups into the air for collection), there’s a grab and throw for hurling boulders. You are just marching around the environments fucking shit up.
This can feel a bit chaotic — and actually resulted in some motion sickness, requiring me to turn down some of the sensitivity settings — but it was a blast. The meditative platforming you might find in a Mario game has been replaced by something entirely different, and entirely in line with Donkey Kong’s persona. Dude loves bananas and wrecking shit.
The game does have some purpose to it. Sometimes you are given mini objectives to keep things moving, like using exploding boulders to open up new pathways. And there are a ton of collectibles hidden within the walls and underground to uncover. The levels appear to be quite large and seemingly filled with a number of different paths you can go down, makingBananzafeel much more in line with what you’d expect from a major first-party Nintendo release. But all of that felt secondary to the pure joy of destroying the world around me.
I cleared out a particularly gold-filled area, only to look back on the chaos I had wrought. It was like a tornado had whipped through the heart of the mine, and no one was spared.

Farewell physical media — some Nintendo Switch 2 games aren’t on the carts,2025-04-02T23:27:29Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551614/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards,"Old man yells at The Cloud
byChristopher Grant
It’s a good thing that theNintendo Switch 2comes with a base 256 GB of internal storage — eight times more than the original Switch’s paltry 32 GB — because some Nintendo Switch 2 games won’t come on the cartridge at all. Instead, so-called game-key cards will simply contain a “key” that you will use to download the game, according toa support page on Nintendo’s website.
“After it’s downloaded, you can play the game by inserting the game-key card into your system and starting it up like a standard physical game card,” the page reads. Here’s how that looks on the retail packaging:
Some additional fine print on how this works:
An internet connection is only required when you launch the game for the first time. After this, the game can be started even without an internet connection. However, like regular physical software, the game-key card must be inserted into the system in order to play the game.
In some ways, this is a new spin on an old trick. Some Nintendo Switch games have been sold at retail, but the packaging simply included a code used to download the game to your account. To be fair, this hasn’t been as common on Switch as it has been on competing consoles, but nevertheless, for the people still committed to purchasing physical games, it riles. This is, in fact, the same tactic that Microsoft (in)famously unveiled alongside the Xbox One; of course, that was over a decade ago, and consumer sentiment has changed. We’re all Game Passing and PS Plus-ing our games, and maybe potentially feel some “ownership” over the digital goods we’re purchasing on Steam. Maybe.
But I’m one of those physical media people! First, I’m scientifically “old.” I was born in the 1970s, my first job was at a video store (ask your parents), and I still have a large collection of video games (and video game consoles ?). I understand that I am not the target demographic, in many ways. But also, until the Switch, the prospect of purchasing digital Nintendo games was foolish! If you lost your Nintendo DS or 3DS on a bus — a not-unheard-of scenario for a portable game console — your digital purchases were gone. Here I am yelling aboutNintendo’s shoddy online servicesin2012 just before the launch of the Wii U, and again in2017 just before the launch of the Switch.
The good news: I don’t need to write that same piece again! Nintendo has kinda figured this out. I still buy my Switch games in cartridge format, not because I’m afraid of losing the Switch (and, by extension, my entire library), but because doing so makes it easier to share games with friends and family, including people in my own household. But I also genuinely worry about what happens when companies — and maybe, specifically here, Nintendo — take their own game servers offline. Can I download what I bought?How do I play older gamesI care about? Microsoft has been working to address theunsatisfactory vibes of digital ownership, and I often point out that my Steam library persists even as so (so, so) many of the developers and publishers behind the games in my Steam library no longer do.
So let’s call this a sign of the times. We don’t know how often Nintendo and its publishing partners will use this “game-key card” solution, and maybe in some cases it’s the right answer — surely some games will simply be too large to fit on this storage device. Switch game cards capped out at 32 GB, while thecoming-to-Switch-2Cyberpunk 2077comes on a massive 64 GB game card, according to a press release. That’s a lot of expensive one-time storage, and with the Switch 2 competing with the PlayStations and Xboxes of the world foreven more third-party titles, you can imagine storage requirements going up from there. Even if it maybe makes sense, I don’t have to like it.
[Update: Added details on theCyberpunk 2077game card size, and information on internet requirements to use game-key cards.]

"Switch 2’s ‘improved’ eShop won’t be such a laggy mess, Nintendo says",2025-04-02T21:56:51Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/551984/nintendo-switch-2-eshop-improvements,"Nintendo’s eShop will reportedly be a smoother experience on the new console

Navigating the eShop on the Nintendo Switch is a trial. Not only does it chug when you’re scrolling through games, it’s borderline impossible to find exactly what you want. Even new games are sometimes hard to find. And there areentire websitesdedicated to doing the heavy lifting for you so you don’t ever have to engage with it. It’s a mess that hasn’t been cleaned up for years.
According to Nintendo developers in arecent official interview, Switch 2’s updated eShop won’t be as awful to use.
“Thanks to the system’s performance capabilities, Nintendo eShop onSwitch 2has been improved and runs smoothly even when displaying a large number of games,” Takuhiro Dohta, senior director of the entertainment, planning, and development department said.
A new Game Finds for You feature on the eShop will highlight screenshots and videos of recommended games. Producer of the entertainment, planning, and development department Kouichi Kawamoto believes it will help you “easily find something interesting without having to search every nook and cranny of the Nintendo eShop.”
That’s good news, because the eShop is currently overrun with clones of popular games, likeUnpacking, and games usinggenerative AI artwith no clear disclaimers. Nintendo didn’t specifically comment on this in the interview, but official curation could be a way around it.
Other common issues with the eShop’s poor search results and wonky wishlist integration weren’t mentioned either. All we have is an extremely brief clipwithin the interview transcriptshowing what the new interface will look like, but it’s too short to get into the details of how everything will work.
Nintendo didn’t spend a lot of time talking about the eShop during theSwitch 2 Directtoday. Instead, the company focused onnew gamesandnew features. Let’s just hope the eShop gets the upgrades it’s needed for so long, so discovering new games isn’t such a pain.

Everything we know about Nintendo Switch 2 backward compatibility,2025-04-02T21:10:18Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551581/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-explained,"More than 180 Switch games may not play properly

Nintendo confirmed back in November 2024, two months before the company evenunveiled the Nintendo Switch 2, that the new console would bebackward-compatible with games for the original Nintendo Switch. Now, after detailing the system’s hardware and software in anhourlong Nintendo Direct presentation, the company has provided the first real specifics on the nature of Switch 2’s backward compatibility.
We now know that theSwitch 2will work with many Switch accessories — including, most importantly, the original console’s Joy-Cons and Pro Controller — as well as games. But as Nintendo has previously hinted, not every Switch game will be playable (or, at least, fully playable) on the Switch 2. Here’s what we’ve learned so far.
Yes, Nintendo confirmed in its April 2 Nintendo Direct that the Switch 2 will support both physical and digital copies of Switch games. The size of the cartridge isn’t changing; it’s just that Game Cards for the Switch 2 will be red, as opposed to the gray ones for the original Switch. (They’ll also have “much faster data reading speeds” than the old ones, said Tetsuya Sasaki, hardware design lead for the Switch 2, in the Nintendo Direct.)
The Switch 2 doesn’t contain any hardware from the original Switch, and Nintendo isn’t relying on software emulation for backward compatibility, either. Instead, the company’s solution falls “somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility,” said Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta in anAsk the Developer interview published by Nintendo. Sasaki explained, “The process of converting game data for Switch to run on Switch 2 is performed on a real-time basis as the data is read in,” which makes it sound similar to the way Proton gets Windows PC games to run on the Linux-basedSteam Deck.
This method allows for adding Switch 2 features, such asGameChatsupport, to Switch games played via backward compatibility. Dohta added, “We believe there are many things we can do, such as making Switch games compatible with GameShare through free updates, as well as leveraging Switch 2’s processing power to enable games to run in higher resolution and with a smoother frame rate.”
Nintendo has not indicated that the Switch 2 will provide across-the-board improvements to graphics or performance when running Switch games, although that will happen with some games. It appears that it will be up to developers and publishers to issue patches to deliver these upgrades.
So far, Nintendo has detailed two different strategies for upgrading first-party Switch games. Select titles — thelist on the Nintendo websitecurrently features a dozen — will get “free updates to improve playability on the Nintendo Switch 2 system.” The games in question run the gamut from launch-year titles likeSuper Mario Odysseyto recent releases such asThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. In addition to performance improvements, these patches can add elements like support for Switch 2 features such asGameShare.
The other upgrade route sounds like it will offer more significant additions and improvements to certain Switch games — but this one will cost you money. Nintendo will sell what it calls an “upgrade pack” for these titles; the company hasn’t yet said how much it will charge. A bundle of a game and its upgrade pack will be known as a “Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.”
At this point, the company has announced upgrade packs for six games:Kirby and the Forgotten Land,The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,Super Mario Party Jamboree, and the upcoming titlesMetroid Prime 4: BeyondandPokémon Legends: Z-A(both of which are scheduled to launch in 2025).
The details vary greatly depending on the game. For the new Pokémon game, all you get is “improved performance with higher frame rate and resolution.” Both of theZelda upgradeswill deliver that, along with faster load times, HDR, and support for the new Zelda Notes service.Metroid Prime 4: Beyondwill be playable on Switch 2 with mouse controls, thanks to the Joy-Con 2. And the upgrade packs for bothSuper Mario Party JamboreeandKirby and the Forgotten Landwill offer new content.
That would be a tall order, and the answer is no — but the level of support, as seen ona page on the Nintendo website that details the Switch 2’s backward-compatibility functionality, does seem impressive so far.
Nintendo is currently working its way through the entire library of Switch games one by one, conducting “limited testing” with each game to see if it works on the Switch 2. “It might not be that all Switch games run perfectly in time for the launch of Switch 2, but we will continue our efforts so that we can support as many Switch games as possible,” said Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto in the Ask the Developer interview.
Nintendo says that as of April 1, it has tested 122 first-party Switch titles and found only one that doesn’t work with the Switch 2 —Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit. That package came with a cardboard contraption that turned the Switch into a pair of virtual reality goggles, and the Switch 2 is a bigger device, so it simply can’t fit into it.
However,Nintendo Labo won’t be completely dead on the Switch 2: Toy-Con 01, Toy-Con 02, and Toy-Con 03 will each work to some degree. Those three titles and six otherscan only be played on the Switch 2 using Joy-Cons from the original Switch, because they rely on something unique about those controllers. Some games, likeWarioWare: Move It!, need the infrared camera in the right Joy-Con, which doesn’t exist in the Joy-Con 2; others, likeRing Fit Adventure, use an accessory that the Joy-Con 2 can’t fit into.
By Nintendo’s count, more than 15,000 third-party games have been released for the Switch. In the company’s testing so far, it has found141 titlesthat don’t boot up at all on the Switch 2, including popular games such asDead by Daylight,Doom Eternal, andFortnite. (Thankfully,Fortniteappeared in the April 2 Nintendo Direct as a Switch 2 launch title, which takes care of that concern.) An additional47 gamesare listed as “playable” with “some in-game compatibility issues”; these includeAlan Wake Remastered,Fall Guys, andStreet Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.
It’s possible that those numbers will go up as Nintendo tests more games, but it’s also likely that some titles will come off these lists as the company works with third parties to address the compatibility issues.
Yup! With a few exceptions, peripherals such as the Switch’s Joy-Cons and Pro Controller will be compatible with the Switch 2. You can checkNintendo’s support sitefor a full list of Switch accessories to see whether the Switch 2 supports them.
As far as the Joy-Cons go, note that because the Switch 2 uses a magnetic hookup for its Joy-Con 2 controllers — rather than the sliding mechanism for the original Switch and its Joy-Cons — it isn’t possible to connect Switch Joy-Cons to the Switch 2; they can only be paired and used wirelessly. (That also means that you won’t be able to charge the Joy-Cons unless you slide them back onto your Switch, or you have a Charging Grip or Charging Stand for that system lying around.)
The Switch Pro Controller can be charged by plugging it into the Switch 2 dock or one of the system’s two USB-C ports, but it must still be paired wirelessly in order to be used. In other words, awired connectionisn’t supported with the Switch 2 as it is with the Switch.
No, unfortunately. While Nintendo made a point of saying in its April 2 Nintendo Direct presentation that the Switch and Switch 2 have the exact same depth — they’re both 13.9 mm (0.55 in) thick — the original Switch’s dock is not compatible with the Switch 2. The issue could come down to physical differences in the bottom edge of the console that prevent it from sitting in the old dock. But it’s more likely that it’s related to the innards of the Switch 2’s dock, which include a fan to keep the tablet cool while it’s running games at resolutions as high as 4K.
The Switch 2 features 256 GB of onboard storage, and it can be expandedonly with microSD Express cards. This is a flash memory standard with significantly faster read and write speeds than the garden-variety microSD cards that the original Switch supports.
You can slot a microSD card from your original Switch into the Switch 2, but all you’ll be able to do with it is view or copy screenshots and videos that you’ve captured in Switch games and saved to the card.

Donkey Kong wears pants now — is this Seth Rogen’s doing?,2025-04-02T21:01:47Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/551826/donkey-kong-bananza-pants-seth-rogen,"Something’s up with Kong’s bottom
byMichael McWhertor
Donkey Kong will break new ground in his newSwitch 2game,Donkey Kong Bananza. I mean that literally, in the sense that the 3D action-adventure game is about destruction and digging into the hard earth with DK’s meaty fists. ButBananzawill also push the Donkey Kong series forward by putting pants on Nintendo’s iconic ape. That’s right, Donkey Kong is no longer just weirdly wearing a tie but otherwise completely naked; this Kong wears trousers (and suspenders).
Do we have actor, producer, andceramics enthusiastSeth Rogento thank for this? Maybe.
Rogen, whovoiced Donkey KonginThe Super Mario Bros. Movie, previously said in a behind-the-scenes interview about his role, “It’s a fun character, it’s a fun world. I would be thrilled to see Donkey Kong go on more adventures. Maybe give him some pants this time.”
That movie hasdefinitely had an impact on Donkey Kong’s current design. But it is strange that Donkey Kong, who has famously not worn pants over the course of his career, is now just wearing britches out of nowhere. Other Kongs, like Funky Kong, Tiny Kong, and Lanky Kong, have worn pants, but DK’s immediate family, including Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong, have been content Donald Ducking it for decades. So it clearly isn’t a shame thing.
Only rarely has DK worn anything below the waist, including what I’d consider non-canonical appearances in games likeSkylanders: SuperChargers,where he wore a full outfit. Otherwise, including at events like the Olympics, Kong keeps things banana out. (Of his pockets. Because he has no pants pockets to put bananas in.)
It’s clear fromDonkey Kong Bananzascreenshots that at a certain point in the game, Donkey Kong willacquire(or lose) the pants. So it’s not like Nintendo has suddenly found new modesty regarding DK’s bare bottom, which will be presented with more realistic detail and seen directly from behind inBananza(as opposed to side-on in the Donkey Kong Country games). The game’s trailer also shows many other apes wearing slacks, jeans, and bottoms, so maybe this is a new thing that primates in the Mario universe do.
We’ve asked Nintendo to shed some light on Donkey Kong’s new pants-wearing habit, and will update when the company responds with answers to this mystery.
But we may have to wait until July to fully understand the reasons behind Donkey Kong’s new wardrobe.Donkey Kong Bananzawill be released onNintendo Switch 2on July 17.

Switch 2 Direct’s technical difficulties swallowed up a whole new game reveal,2025-04-02T19:53:40Z,https://www.polygon.com/pc/551732/switch-2-direct-astroneer-starseeker-co-op,"The developers ofAstroneerwere robbed of their trailer debut

Nintendo’s Switch 2 Directstream suffered technical issues at the most inopportune time for the developers ofAstroneer. Near the end of Wednesday’s presentation, a trailer for their new game debuted on the stream during a period where many viewers were stuck looking at a glitchy mess.
“Hey so uh one of the mainNintendo Switch 2 Directstreams completely ate our trailer due to I guess technical difficulties?” System Era Softworks social media manager Lotus Dwyer wrote onBluesky.
The new game is calledStarseeker: Astroneer Expeditions, and if things had gone right, you could’ve recognized the similarities to the studio’s previous game almost immediately. It’s a cooperative game with colorful planets full of weird creatures and plant life. TheBluesky postwith the trailer describes it as a game about “the joy of discovery and the camaraderie that emerges from an evolving, cooperative experience,” which suggests your crew of goofy astronauts will visit many different planets than the one we saw.
Over on theSteam page, the description points out that each planet will have different objectives that can only be completed by using your team’s set of tools. Between missions, you’ll return to “an ever-evolving space station” known as the ESS Starseeker to get upgrades and plan your next expedition.
System Era Softworks saysStarseekertakes place in theAstroneeruniverse, but isn’t a direct sequel.Astroneerwill continue to be updated “for years to come.”
Starseekeris coming to the Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X in 2026. You can sign up to playtest an early version of the game in the future viathe official Discord server.

Nintendo wants to compete in a new type of console war,2025-04-02T19:26:30Z,https://www.polygon.com/analysis/551719/nintendo-switch-2-console-war,"Why Nintendo wants Madden and Borderlands on its new handheld
byChris Plante
Nintendo took an unusual approach to the past two decades of video game console wars. It stayed out of them. But with today’sNintendo Switch 2 info dump— packed with big-name third-party games rarely seen onNintendo hardware— the House that Mario Built appears ready to rejoin the fray. Why now? Credit a collision of confidence, opportunity, and necessity.
Sony and Microsoft have spent generations bloodying each other in a battle for the most extravagant visuals, courting favor with major publishers like Activision and Electronic Arts. Meanwhile, Nintendo swam in the opposite direction, favoring cheaper, less powerful machines that prioritized toy-like novelty over raw specs.
The historic successes of both the Wii and the Switch obscure how risky this gamble has been. The slower hardware — with a few, better-forgotten exceptions — couldn’t run the latest entries in gaming’s most popular franchises, including Madden, Call of Duty, and Grand Theft Auto. Survival hinged on Nintendo’s ability to produce multiple exclusive hits each year, with smaller indie titles filling the gaps.
With the Switch, everything went Nintendo’s way — by both design and good fortune. The publisher assembled arguably the greatest first-party lineup in history. Indie development exploded. And a new wave of beloved IP —Minecraft,Fortnite, Roblox — designed for smartphone-level specs meant that Nintendo’s hardware, unintentionally, could play some of the biggest games on the planet.
And yet, today, Nintendo’s hourlongSwitch 2reveal stream featured anabundance of titlesonce rare on its systems. 2K Games showed off new entries in the WWE, Civilization, and Borderlands franchises. Other developers, like IO Interactive, pledged to bring hits once best experienced on Xbox or PlayStation, like Hitman and the upcomingProject 007. Square Enix showed theremakes ofFinal Fantasy 7, and EA appeared, committing EA Sports FC and Madden to the platform.
It’s possible that coming off the success of the Switch — a far cry from Nintendo’s grim posture after the Wii U — the gamemaker feels positioned to push into the third-party territory ceded to Sony and Microsoft, the latter of which seems to be clinging to its hardware business by its fingertips. After all, Nintendo has sold over 150 million Switch consoles — more than the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S combined.
It’s also possible a mix of luck and industry trends will once again favor Nintendo. Sony and Microsoft’s reluctance to fully leave the PS4 and Xbox One era behind — coupled with a generation raised on mobile gaming — has trained AAA developers to build for underpowered hardware. TheSwitch 2will still trail behind top-tier machines in horsepower, but that may no longer matter. Most major franchises simply don’t demand cutting-edge specs.
Both of those are likely a piece of the puzzle. But I believe Nintendo’s decision to release amore expensiveand slightly morepowerful devicemay have less to do with past console wars and more to do with its biggest threat in the present. In 2025, Valve’s Steam Deck does what the Switch doesn’t: It lets players enjoy most AAA games anytime, anywhere — and offers many of the same indie titles at steep discounts. (That it also runs emulated games from every Nintendo console ever released surely isn’t lost on the company either, as it continues its crackdown on third-party emulation.)
If Nintendo once again ignores third parties and their graphical needs, it would find itself competing against a growing number of handhelds that offer more power and more games, often with better specs — albeit higher prices.
Inexplicably, Microsoft and Sony burned an entire hardware cycle without answering the Switch’s key selling point: portability. It took a PC gaming marketplace — with almost no hardware pedigree — to offer legitimate competition. And Nintendo, with the Switch 2’s higher price, greater power, and suite of PC-like social features, seems to be taking the threat seriously.
Yes, Nintendo has reentered the modern console wars. Maybe, one day, Sony and Microsoft will too.

Switch 2 games are breaking the $70 game price barrier,2025-04-02T19:00:55Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551684/game-prices-mario-kart-world,"Nintendo’s new Mario Kart is pricey
byMichael McWhertor
We knew there was a new Mario Kart coming to Switch 2, but we didn’t expect it to cost this much. After showing off the open-world racing gameMario Kart Worldon Wednesday during itsSwitch 2 Nintendo Directshowcase, Nintendo revealed that the game will have a $79.99 price tag. That’s new territory for Nintendo, which just two years ago made headlines bycharging $69.99forThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
ButMario Kart World’s high asking price doesn’t appear to be the standard for Switch 2 software. Nintendo also confirmed Wednesday thatDonkey Kong Bananza, coming to Switch 2 in July, will cost $69.99. Still, these are indicators that Nintendo is comfortable charging more not just for the Switch successor, but for its next-gen games too.
Those prices may only represent the digital versions of those Switch 2 games. Pricing announced in some territories shows that Nintendo plans to charge even more for the physical editions of games likeMario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananza.
Nintendo has not announced prices for other games or the Switch 2 upgrade packs that were revealed as part of Wednesday’s Nintendo Direct, though it did put a price on another Switch 2 launch game,Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, if only in Japan. That virtual exploration of the Switch 2 hardware will cost 990 yen for a digital copy, which will probably translate to a sub-$10 price in the U.S.
Price increases on software aren’t uncommon during next-generation console transitions. When the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 launched, standard game pricing jumped from $49.99 to $59.99, a price point that held steady for more than a decade. In 2020, alongside the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, prices crept up further, with some publishers charging $69.99 for certain games. Nintendo itself caught up with that trend withTears of the Kingdom,following Microsoft’s lead, with its first $69.99 game.
Despite the reality of inflation, the increasing cost of game development, and the value often associated with live-service games like Mario Kart, reaction to pricing for Switch 2 games has beenwidely negative. Combined with thehigh price of the Switch 2itself, Nintendo may have a harder time reaching the success of the original Switch than some expected.

All the ways you should prep to pre-order a Nintendo Switch 2,2025-04-02T18:39:25Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551622/switch-2-pre-order-reservation-queue-nintendo,"You and everyone else will be trying to get one, but these tips will boost your chances

The Nintendo Switch 2 is launching onJune 5. Pre-orders were initially going live on Wednesday,April 9, but those plans have been postponed due toNintendo assessing the “potential impact of tariffs.” A new pre-order date will be shared at a later time.
The original article follows below.
While I wish to exist in a world where you could easily click “buy” and be guaranteed a console come launch day, it’s not so simple in reality. Hundreds of thousands of people, if not more, are going to be showing up simultaneously, putting a strain on both servers and allocated pre-order stock. In other words, you’ll be lucky to score a pre-order reservation.
That said, there are ways you can prepare yourself for whenever the Switch 2 goes up for pre-order in the hopes of boosting your chance of success. You can sign up to be among the first to know when retailers go live with pre-orders — and, if you’re a longtime Nintendo Switch player, you might be eligible to skip the usual online retailer rush.
Starting with Nintendo,the company is accepting sign-upsfor those hoping to reserve a Switch 2, but there are multiple requirements in place, likely to quash the number of consoles resellers can get their hands on. To express interest in pre-ordering a Switch 2 from Nintendo, you must do the following by April 2:
Only if you meet that criteria can you submit the form to express interest in reserving. That said, there’s no guarantee that you’ll be chosen to receive an invite. But if you are chosen, you’ll get an email from Nintendo on or after May 8 to purchase either the $449.99 model, or the $499.99 model that includesMario Kart World. If you receive an invitation, you’ll have 72 hours to follow through with a purchase.
Whether you qualify for Nintendo’s strict pre-order process or not, it’s a good idea to sign up for email notifications at Best Buythrough this page. Doing so will ensure that you get an email with a specific pre-order time for the Switch 2. Additionally, it’ll loop you into a newsletter that’s only about the Switch 2,its games, and related content (you won’t receive other Best Buy newsletters).
GameStop has aproduct page up for the Switch 2, and you’ll want to enter your email address to receive communications about the specific pre-order details.
Additionally, if you plan to pre-order at GameStop, you should know that it’srunning a promotion beginning April 9that lets customers get up to $175 trade-in credit for their Switch consoles when reserving a Switch 2. The amount of trade-in credit you’ll get depends on the model you’re trading in, as well as its condition and whether you have all of the components.

TheNintendo Switch 2will cost $449.99, and will beavailable to pre-order April 9. The closest thing to a discount on it comes fromGameStop, which is offering slightly boosted trade-in value for your old Switch starting the day that pre-orders begin. You’ll only get the following trade-in credit if you’re reserving a Switch 2. Although, if you reserve a Switch 2 from GameStop and later realize you want to trade in your Switch, you’ll be able to modify your reservation with a boosted trade-in through April 30.
Your Switch OLED will knock $175 off the cost of the Switch 2. Outside of this promo, GameStop’s offer for OLEDs sits at $143, which is less than half of the console’s original cost. If you have the standard Switch with removable Joy-Con (be it the launch edition or the revised model with better battery life), you’ll get $125 in credit, up from $110, a measly third of its original price. As for the Switch Lite, you’ll get an even $100 in credit, up from $71.50. If you’re a GameStop Pro member, you’ll get an extra 10% added to the trade-in credit.
In order to get these trade-in valuations, your hardware needs to be in “good condition” and come with all “necessary” components, which I’m guessing means what normally comes with each console when you first opened the box.

"Even with inflation, Switch 2 is one of Nintendo’s priciest consoles ever",2025-04-02T17:13:06Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551545/price-history-comparison-inflation,"It’s-a me, economic anxiety over inflation and US tariffs
byChristopher Grant
January’s Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event took the wraps off the console, but left a lot of details unanswereduntil now. After the initial reveal, I put togetheran analysis of the possible pricingfor the console, using Nintendo’s own historical pricing strategies to guide my thinking. My conclusion then was that it would cost $399.
I…was wrong. The Nintendo Switch 2 will debut in Junestarting at $449.99, with a $499.99 version that includesMario Kart World.
At that price, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be the most expensive console Nintendo has ever released, by some margin. And even adjusted for inflation, and when considering the various bundle packages of previous Nintendo consoles, the Nintendo Switch 2 will still be the most expensive Nintendo console ever made!
It’s not quite June yet, so I can’t update this chart to reflect the inflation-adjusted price to the same date of the Switch 2 launch, but the prices from February of this year are pretty illustrative of the change here.
[Ed. note:An earlier version of this list didn’t include information on pack-in games included in some console releases, and didn’t include the various NES bundles and prices. Adjusted for inflation, only the very first NES release — a tricked-out bundle originally limited to test markets only — would be more expensive than the Nintendo Switch 2. Once you compare it to the more widely released Control Deck release just a few months later, the relative cost of the Nintendo Switch 2 is clear.]
But it wasn’t just me that was wrong! Nearly 57% of ourpoll respondents agreedwith my predicted $399 price, and just 9% thought it would come in at $449. (If that was you, congratulations!) Is that indicative that Nintendo will have a hard time moving units at $449, or simply that people didn’t think Nintendo would go that high? It’s too early to say.
Earlier reporting from Bloomberg, citing multiple industry analysts, pegged the pricebetween $399 and $499, so… nailed it?
On price, the analysts Bloomberg spoke to are unanimous in expecting the Switch 2 to cost at least $399 — which, again, agrees with Polygon’s own analysis. Some think it could go higher, to $449 or even $499, driven by the cost of components and fears over the impact of U.S. tariffs. At $499 it would be the same price as a PlayStation 5 (and $50 more than a digital-only model).
Here again is a list of all of the current-gen consoles, now including the Switch 2 and its confirmed pricing:
At $449, the Switch 2 will go toe to toe on pricing with the all-digital variants of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, which is in keeping with the Switch’s 2017 launch price that matched the $299 being asked for the PS4 Slim and Xbox One S. It’s worth noting, however, that $299 in 2017 dollars still comes in under $400 in today’s bucks, when adjusted for inflation. It’s not just you — everything really is just more expensive!
One last consideration: While the Switch 2’s specs actually put it a notch above the Steam Deck in some key categories, like resolution and including a 4K-compatible dock out of the box, I didn’t expect Valve’s portable gaming PC to beat Nintendo on pricing. The Steam Deck APU is going on three years old at this point, and a little long in the tooth, but it’s hard to argue against the value embedded in Valve’s storefront. (I boughtUndertalefor $1 recently just to have another copy.) So with Valve continuing to make a name for itself, and with Microsoftreportedly entering the portable gaming spacethis year in partnership with Asus, Nintendo no longer has the exclusive lock on the portable gaming market.
Update: I updated the headline and some of the opening paragraphs, along with the first pricing comparison chart, to reflect that when evaluated on a more like-to-like basis the Nintendo Switch 2, with and without a pack-in game, is in fact the most expensive Nintendo console ever released, when adjusted for inflation.

Switch 2 exclusive The Duskbloods is giving off strong Bloodborne vibes,2025-04-02T16:25:58Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551375/switch-2-duskbloods-bloodborne-sequel-fromsoftware,"But maybe we’re just seeing what we want to see
byIan Walker
Duringtoday’s Switch 2 breakdown, Nintendo showed off an exclusive FromSoftware game for the upcoming console calledThe Duskbloods, which despiteits online multiplayer focuslooks kind of like aBloodbornesequel in everything but name.
The Duskbloodsreveal opens with a man taking a nap in an ornate chair. A woman, who appears to be lying on the floor so as to avoid the moonlight streaming through a nearby window, grabs his hand and seemingly leaves behind a circular brand. In true FromSoft fashion, she imparts cryptic dialogue through it all, telling some unseen presence, “I give you my blood. I give you my life. Turn a wheel and transport him to a night of moonlight, to humanity’s very dusk.”
What follows is a smattering of cutscenes and gameplay showcasing a semi-Gothic world that at points looks like a mashup ofBloodborneandElden Ringas well as something completely new and steampunk-y. A futuristic train zooms through a grimy industrial district. A heroic figure, clad head to toe in clunky, Iron Man-like armor, jetpacks from a cliffside and flies above a very Victorian-era skyline. A broken, metallic man hovers dramatically in a cathedral with what looks like a rifle slung across his back.
Some of these aesthetics fly in the face of what one might expect from aBloodbornesequel, sure, but it still feels like the FromSoft team wants us to viewThe Duskbloodsas a spiritual successor.Bloodbornetold a deeply symbolic story about humanity’s connections to blood and the moon, specifically its mythical ties to reproduction. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that our first look atThe Duskbloodsmakes frequent allusions to similar motifs, even if the game ultimately has nothing to do withBloodborne.
Small details support this hypothesis as well.Bloodborneis the only game in the Soulsborne pseudo-genre to feature guns, and several firearms feature prominently inThe Duskbloods. Theofficial FromSoft websitementionsThe Duskbloodsplayers throwing themselves into “a violent fray for ‘First Blood’,” which sounds an awful lot likeBloodborne’s elder god-linked Old Blood. And this may be a stretch, but a man near the end ofThe Duskbloodstrailer strikes a pose (see the top of this blog post) similar toBloodborne’s iconic Make Contact gesture.
It’s easy to understand why folks want to seeBloodborneinThe Duskbloods. Developed for PlayStation 4 in cooperation with Sony’s Japan Studio (rest in peace),Bloodbornehas been locked to a single platform since its 2015 launch. Fans are hungry for any acknowledgement of its existence, and they’ll eagerly tune into every major gaming event hoping forBloodborneto make an appearance.
It’s a shameThe Duskbloodsmay be resigned to the same fate due to its Switch 2 exclusivity, but its existence may be a clue as to what’s going on withBloodbornebehind the scenes. Sony owns that property, so any futureBloodborneproject would need its approval even if FromSoftware’s developers were to develop a remaster or even a follow-up. It’s possibleThe Duskbloodsis FromSoft’s way of finally giving folks what they want without the hassle of getting Sony’s okay.
The Duskbloodslaunches on the Switch 2 in 2026.

They’re just letting anyone drive in Mario Kart World,2025-04-02T16:21:26Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551483/mario-kart-world-roster-drivers-racers-characters,"Ain’t no rule says a cow can’t play Mario Kart
byMichael McWhertor
Switch 2 launch titleMario Kart Worldwill feature 24-player races for the first time in series history. That bigger player count therefore warrants an expanded roster of racers, which means Nintendo is now forced to let anyone and anything from the Mario series get behind the wheel. From Moo Moos to Fish Bones (you know, the animated bones of dead Cheep Cheeps), no restrictions will be placed on who is licensed to drive in the sequel toMario Kart 8 Deluxe.
Yes, the classic lineup of racers will be present inMario Kart World. Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Toad, and Toadette — they’re all here as part of the roster. But so are the dolphins and penguins from the world of Super Mario, which are known as Dolphins and Penguins, respectively. Piantas fromSuper Mario Sunshineare playable, as are Para-Biddybuds fromSuper Mario 3D Land, Snowmen fromSuper Mario 64, and Sidesteppers fromMario Bros.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxehad a whopping 48 playable characters — including the game’s DLC, but not including variants — andMario Kart Worldlooks like it might rival or eventually beat that, based on the huge number of characters Nintendo has already shown (more than 40!). We’ll likely get more details on who’s capable of riding a kart, motorcycle, plane, and snowmobile — even if they don’t have arms and legs — during a dedicated Nintendo Direct forMario Kart World, which is coming on April 17.
For now, here’s who we can expect on theMario Kart Worldroster, based on the game’s debut trailer. (Confirmed playable characters are listed first in bold.)
Mario Kart Worldwill be released on June 5, the same day Nintendo Switch 2 launches.

The Nintendo Switch didn’t make it easy to let you connect with friends and strangers over the internet. TheSwitch 2, on the other hand, is fully embracing connectivity. To that end, a stand-up camera will be launched alongside the Switch 2 onJune 5that can be used with its GameChat feature.
GameChat functionality varies on a per-game basis, butNintendo’s Switch 2 Directshowcase showed it putting faces within the Switch 2 Edition ofSuper Mario Party Jamboree, letting gamers overlay their faces on their game screens.
The official Switch 2 Camera is $49.99 (and isdetailed here), and it plugs into the Switch 2’s USB-C port. You can use it when the console is docked to your TV, or when you’re holding it in your hands. The camera specializes in capturing a wide angle shot, and Nintendo claims that its high-sensitivity image can adjust brightness. There’s also a physical privacy shutter that can be activated when you don’t want the camera to look at you.
If you don’t want to buy Nintendo’s camera, you might have luck plugging in one you already own — assuming it plugs in via USB-C — as Nintendo confirmed USC-C support for third-party cameras. It’s likely there will be some restrictions and limitations, but before you buy a new camera, try plugging in your own, either directly or, if needed, with a USB-A to USB-C adapter. In the Switch 2’s software, there will be a “Test USB Camera” feature to check compatibility with the console.

We have a full view ofNintendo Switch 2 gamesnow theApril 2 Directhas come and gone — including a number of exclusives andlaunch titles, and that all-importantrelease datefor the console itself.
It follows months of slim pickings following the console’s initial hardware-focused reveal in January, which also saw developers and publishers holding fire of their involvement until now.
The following Switch 2 games list explains the exclusives, third-party games, and confirmed developers and publishers for the console from the launch and beyond.
Update (April 8):Added two new games —Mouse Workand a Switch 2 version of the recentSuikoden I&II HDremaster.
First, let’s look at the exclusive games coming to the Switch 2, whether that’s from Nintendo itself or from third-parties:
As well as the above full exclusives, there’s a series of“Nintendo Switch 2 Edition”titles, which are Switch 1 games “patched” to make the most out of the Switch 2 hardware (and is different tobackward compatibility). These are available as both “upgrade packs” if you own the Switch 1 version, or as standalone editions for the Switch 2:
Elsewhere, those with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription will get the following“GameCube Classics”from launch day:
As well as the above list of exclusives and Switch 2-specific editions of Switch 1 games, here’s a breakdown of other games confirmed for the Switch 2 from third-parties that are either already on other systems, or are debuting on multiple platforms:

FromSoftware announces The Duskbloods as a Switch 2 exclusive,2025-04-02T14:30:49Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/550315/fromsoftware-new-game-the-duskbloods-switch-2-direct,"﻿The creators of Elden Ring are making a game for the Switch 2
byAna Diaz
FromSoftware, the renowned development studio behind popular games likeElden Ringand the Dark Souls series, announced a brand new game at theNintendo Directon Wednesday. It’s calledThe Duskbloodsand it’s set to be released sometime in 2026, exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2.
The Duskbloodsis an online multiplayer game that supports up to eight players, per thegame’s official website.
The developers aired a short trailer that showed off some of the world and general concepts behind the game. It’s dripping in dark, gothic vibes and the opening intro references an unknown knight of “light.” The game appears to feature a completely original concept with a new world and cast of characters (one of which looks like it preys on a monster like a vampire). That said, the title of the game has many wondering if it’s set in theBloodborneuniverse.
The news comes just after FromSoftware made another big announcement at the Nintendo Switch 2 event. Its global hit,Elden Ring, will be getting a Switch 2 port so even more people will be able to take up the journey and fight as The Tarnished. (TheElden Ring Tarnished Editionport will be released in 2025).
As for non-Switch 2 news, FromSoftware still has some other projects cooking. The studio’s next big game,Elden Ring Nightreign, is set to be released on May 30. There was no mention ofNightreignat the Direct and as of writing, thefast-paced, co-op spinoffwill be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.
For those who want to learn more, game director Hidetaka Miyazaki will share more aboutThe Duskbloodsin a developer diary series called Creator’s Voice on Friday.
Update:We have updated this article to include additional details onThe Duskbloodsfrom a press release.

A new Donkey Kong 3D adventure is coming to Switch 2,2025-04-02T14:25:12Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551135/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-release-date,"Donkey Kong Bananza is out this summer
byMichael McWhertor
A big new Donkey Kong 3D platforming adventure is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo announced Wednesday during itsNintendo Directshowcase dedicated to the new console. It’s calledDonkey Kong Bananza, and it will send (fresh new look) Donkey Kong to heretofore unexplored, underground territories where he’ll smash, grab, and throw things at anyone who stands in his way.
Donkey Kong Bananzawill be released on July 17, about six weeks after theNintendo Switch 2 launchesin June, and it’ll cost $69.99.
WhileDonkey Kong Bananzalooks to be primarily a 3D adventure, a trailer for the Switch 2 game reveals it will apparently have some side-scrolling elements too, in the style of the Donkey Kong Country games.Donkey Kong Bananzawill be DK’s first fully 3D adventure sinceDonkey Kong 64; subsequent games have largely focused on classic side-scrolling action.

Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4 (finally!) debut alongside Nintendo Switch 2,2025-04-02T14:17:25Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551272/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-release-date,"“Tomorrow” is June 5, 2025

If it’s felt like roughly 3-1/2 years since the last installment of Toby Fox’sDeltarune, the wildly popular follow-up to his wildly popular debut gameUndertale, that’s because you have a very good sense of time, congratulations. But after what has been an interminable wait — just scan the official subreddit if you don’t believe me — the next installment, comprised of Chapters 3 and 4, will make its debut alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, 2025, for $24.99.
The first chapter ofDeltarunedebuted in October 2018 as a free download, with the second chapter coming in September 2021, also for free. Fox has said subsequent chapters would not be free, and he’d release more at once … the question then, has been, when? TheDeltarunefan community has met this wait with in-jokes, poring over every missive from Fox to glean clues for a release date, often settling on “tomorrow” as the obvious answer. While not quite “tomorrow,” June 5 feels like an acceptable compromise.
“Deltarune Chapters 1-4 will be released on June 5th as a launch title for Nintendo Switch 2,” Foxposted on Bluesky. “It’s also coming to Steam, Switch, PS4 and PS5 the same day!” This of course leaves off any Xbox platforms which, considering the first two chapters never made an appearance there, stands to reason. Steam users canadd the game to their wishlistnow, if that’s your kind of thing.
In an newsletter Fox revealed the asking price and noted that he feels the price is comped to just these four chapters of Deltarune. “You only have to buy the game once - upcoming Chapters will be added as free updates,” he writes. “That’s not factored into the cost, though. I only feel right charging for what there currently is, not what I say there will be.”
And that’s it for clues as to when the remaining three planned chapters will be released! But let’s not be greedy, a release date and price is enough to chew on for now. For everything else announced at today’s Nintendo Switch 2 event,see here.

Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders will kick off on April 9,2025-04-02T14:16:01Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/550597/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date-online-when,"The $449.99 console will miss its intended pre-order date due to the ‘potential impact of tariffs’
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Following the new tariffs instated by the Trump administration, the originalApril 9 pre-order date for the Nintendo Switch 2 has been postponed. The new pre-order day hasn’t been set, and will be shared by Nintendo at a later date. ItsJune 5 release dateis unchanged.
The original article follows below.
While it’s possible that Nintendo has done everything in its power to ensure that it can meet demand, it seems likely still that Switch 2 pre-orders may be tough to secure ahead of its launch. We’ll have more details when Nintendo shares them on the big day.
Fortunately, paid Switch Online subscribers who, as of April 2, have purchased a minimum of 12 months of the service and have 50 total gameplay hours will get priority access to a batch of pre-orders directly through Nintendo. While you won’t get a loyalty discount, your loyalty has been rewarded with an opportunity to score a console on launch day. You can register your interest in getting a console through theMy Nintendo Store sign-up page, and the first batch of invites will go out on May 8 (look for an email fromno-reply@noa.nintendo.com). If you get an invite, you’ll have 72 hours (three days) to buy before the opportunity passes you by.
TheNintendo Switch 2will come with 256 GB of internal storage, and will cost $449.99. A version of the console that includesMario Kart Worldwill cost $499.99. As for expandable storage to fit more games, it’ll utilizemicroSD Express cards, which have the same form factor as the original Switch’s microSD cards, but are as fast as SSDs. Those start at around $45 for a 128 GB model, or $60 for a 256 GB version. While theSwitch 2 will be backwards compatiblewith most Switch games, you’ll need a microSD Express card to play any type of game on the Switch 2.

Kirby Air Riders for Switch 2 is the sequel we’ve been waiting for,2025-04-02T14:15:44Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551278/kirby-air-riders-announcement,"22 years later, Nintendo is giving us the goods
byJulia Lee
At long last, it’s finally happened.Kirby Air Rideis getting a sequel:Kirby Air Ridersfor theNintendo Switch 2later this year.
We don’t know much about the game yet, but seeing the newly refreshed graphics is enough. The game is being directed by the man, the myth, the legend himself, Masahiro Sakurai, who also directed the original game (and is, y’know, Kirby’s original creator). Notably, this was the last Kirby game Sakurai directed, moving on to direct the Super Smash Bros. series starting withBrawlin 2008.
If you’re not hip to one of the best multiplayer games for the GameCube, let me break it down for you.Kirby Air Rideis a fast-paced racing game where you don’t press any button to accelerate — your warp stars and rides are running fast and hot on their own. You are controlling which directions the rides are going, and pivotal to any Kirby game, you can suck up enemies to copy their abilities and take out your allies. There’s beautiful winding paths, great music, and just overall great vibes.
But the meat ofKirby Air Ridethat set it apart from other racing games was its “City Trial” game mode, where you would be plunked down against three others in a huge city map, and you’ll have five minutes to collect as many power-ups as you can — and if you’re lucky, find the three parts of a legendary air ride machine. After those five minutes of chaos are up, there’ll be a match of some kind, whether it’s a race, a duel, a contest to see who can take out the most enemies, etc. Whoever wins that, wins the game! That being said, you don’t really know which mini-game will appear at the end, so your investment into a ride that can glide infinitely may be wasted when it turns out you have to fight King Dedede.
That being said, the new look forKirby Air Ridersdidn’t show off any new version of City Trial, but it’ll likely live on in the new title, as it’d be criminal to launch this game without it.

Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Cyberpunk 2077 lead a rush of AAA Switch 2 ports,2025-04-02T14:09:44Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551088/final-fantasy-7-remake-third-party-aaa-switch-2-ports,"Freed from the constraints of the original Switch, publishers are making up for lost time
byOli Welsh
Big publishers who haven’t been able to bring their biggest multiplatform games to the Nintendo Switch due to its relative lack of processing power are racing to release ports of these titles on the more powerful Switch 2. We got our first indication of this during Wednesday’sSwitch 2 Direct, with the announcement of Switch 2 versions ofElden Ring,Split Fiction,EA Sports FCandMadden NFL,Hogwarts Legacy,Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3+4,Hitman World of Assassination(plus developer IO Interactive’s forthcoming James Bond game),Yakuza 0,Borderlands 4,Street Fighter 6,Civilization 7,Cyberpunk 2077,WWEandNBA 2K,Final Fantasy 7 Remake.
Cyberpunk 2077will be available from day one, June 5, as Switch 2 launch games. So willStreet Fighter 6,Civilization 7,Hitman,Hogwarts Legacy,Yakuza 0, andSplit Fiction, and several other third-party games.Final Fantasy 7 Remakeis currently in development and will head to Switch 2 at a later date.Indie developers are also getting involved:Hades 2,Silksong, andDeltarunechapters 3 and 4 will be coming to Switch 2, among many others.
The show of third-party support for the Switch 2 during the Direct is likely just the tip of the iceberg; Nintendo hasreportedly been very selectiveabout the partners it has been willing to share Switch 2 developer kits with up to this point. At the moment, it seems to be big publishers like Square Enix, EA, and Capcom who’ve been given access, along with select major independent studios.
Nevertheless, it’s a marked shift in tone from the launch of the Switch, when third-parties, wary of Nintendo after the failure of the Wii U, were slow to get on board. By the time they did, they only had a narrow window to release ports likeDoomandThe Witcher 3before the gap between the handhelds’ capabilities and the power requirements of modern AAA games became too large to bridge.
The Switch 2 has now narrowed that gap, and this time publishers are keen to get involved from day one. Perhaps it was the 150-million-plus sales of the Switch that persuaded them?
Correction: This article has been updated to clarify thatFinal Fantasy 7 Remakewill not be available on the Switch 2 at launch.

byMaddy Myers
We’ve been fascinated bythe Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con’s mouse functionalityever since it was teased during the very first Switch 2 reveal, by way of aJoy-Con gliding aroundon a featureless black surface.
At Wednesday’sSwitch 2 Nintendo Direct, we finally got more details about how the Joy-Con mouse works, and more importantly, the games that are going to make use of this feature.
Multiple Switch 2 games will be implementing the mouse. Here’s a list of all the games that will be enjoying some newfound mouse support:
In the case ofMario Party Jamboree, the mouse won’t work on the original Switch version. And if you own the original Switch 1 version of the game, you’ll need to buy an “upgrade pack” to get the game on your Switch 2. That version of the game will also make use of the chat and webcam features (courtesy ofthe Switch 2’s new C button).

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomfans will be able to see the era-defining Nintendo titles in a new light on Nintendo Switch 2 with a duo of enhanced visual upgrades, Nintendo announced Wednesday during itsNintendo Direct presentation about the new console. If you already own the games, you won’t automatically have the Switch 2 version and will need to purchase an upgrade pack to get it. However, Switch Online subscribers who have the Expansion Pack tier and own copies of these games will get the upgrades for no additional cost, according toNintendo.
The Switch 2 version of each game will include a “Zelda Notes” feature, which will provide game tips to players; you can use this Switch 2-only feature via the Nintendo Switch app on smart devices. It can help you find Korok seeds, for example. That’s in addition to enhanced resolution and frame rates and HDR support.
Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomhave earned their place among the greatest video games of all time, and delivered on the promise of a truly open-world Zelda game where you could see a mountain in the distance and then go climb it. Both games managed this feat on the Switch, which, as a device designed for both big-screen and handheld play, was significantly underpowered compared to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (and later, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X).
Of course, this experience wasn’t without its compromises; at launch forBreath of the Wild, certain areas of the world exhibitednotable performance problems, especially when played in the Switch’s docked mode. Less than a month later,Nintendo issued a patch that made significant improvementsbut didn’t completely alleviate frame-rate drops below 30 frames per second.
Now, the Switch 2’s beefed-up hardware will be able to renderBreath of the Wild’s version of Hyrule with a much fuller degree of fidelity and fluidity.
Update: Added that Switch Online subscribers with the Expansion Pack tier get both Switch 2 Edition versions ofBreath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomfor no added cost if you own them already.

"Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is a virtual guide to the console, but you have to pay for it",2025-04-02T13:42:52Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551133/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-announced,"This is the new 1-2-Switch… kinda
byOli Welsh
Nintendo loves to create games that show off the unique features of its consoles, likeWii Sports,Nintendo Land, and1-2-Switch. TheNintendo Switch 2version of this will be the rather functionally namedNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, in which your tiny avatar will run around on a giant Switch 2 console and explore its features and secrets through the medium of minigames and tech demos.
It looks like the sort of game that might come installed on the console for free, butNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tourwill be a paid, digital-only game. Perhaps that indicates that it’s a bit more substantial and fun than you might expect. It will be available at the console’s launch.
One of the minigames featured is a top-down golf putting game that uses the Joy-Con 2’s mouse and gyroscope sensors so you can push the Joy-Con around on a surface like it’s the head of your golf club. Another seemed to relate to the console’s 3D audio capabilities. Elsewhere, as your avatar explores the Switch 2, clicking on question marks will explain facts about the console, like how the Joy-Con 2’s magnetic attachment works.
Update (April 7):In aninterview with The Verge, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser confirmed thatNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tourwill cost $9.99. Defending the decision to charge for the game, he said, “As this game was being developed, what’s been packed into it is a depth of minigame experiences. They’re very deep, they’re very repeatable. And so, as we looked at that depth of play experience and opportunity, we felt that $9.99 was a fair price to ask for that.”

Nintendo’s GameShare will let you play with friends using just one game copy,2025-04-02T13:34:33Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551126/gameshare-multiplayer-direct,"So which friend will be the one who buys all the multiplayer games?
byJulia Lee
Even if you only own one copy of a game, you and your friends can all get in on the fun together using GameShare, which was shown as part of the April 2Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.
This appears to run similarly to the “Download Play” option for the Nintendo DS. For example, one person may own a copy ofBig Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain, but using the new GameShare option, your friends can jump in and join you to play, even if they don’t own it.
This feature will only work with select games, but the stream did show off a few confirmed titles — includingSuper Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury,Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker,Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics,Super Mario Odyssey, and the aforementionedBig Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain.
The stream also noted that there will be Nintendo Switch 2 games that use this feature, though none were announced yet.
The GameShare feature makes sense, as Nintendo recently also announced the ability to loan your buddies your games usingVirtual Game Cards. In an era of shared Netflix passwords and Steam Family groups, Nintendo understands that not everyone can afford to buy every great title on the market — and that’s what I appreciates about them.

The new Switch 2 Pro controller has a headphone jack,2025-04-02T13:34:06Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/550667/switch-2-pro-controller-wireless-audio,"No USB headset necessary. Just grab a pair of wired headphones
byCameron Faulkner
Nintendo is launching a new version of its beloved Switch Pro controller alongside theSwitch 2. In addition to some welcome upgrades — namely its Chat button that pulls up the GameChat feature — there’s one new feature that’s easy to overlook. That’s because other consoles have supported it for the better part of a decade: wireless audio passthrough. The $79.99 Switch 2 Pro controller has a 3.5mm headphone jack positioned under its D-pad and right analog stick. We’ve waited eight years for this!
While the Switch 2 Pro controller likely won’t launch until June 5 (the same day as the Switch 2 itself) and a price wasn’t confirmed, we’re keeping an eye on when it’ll be available to pre-order. Unless Nintendo is keen on opening the door for more controller manufacturers, this controller likely retains all of the same specialized hardware features that distinguished its predecessor from third-party options, including HD rumble, NFC support for amiibo figures and cards, gyroscopic aiming in games that support it, plus the ability to remotely wake up the Switch from sleep mode.
It remains to be seen as to whether it’s backwards compatible with the original Switch, what kind of fun messagemay be printed on the controller PCB, and whether it uses the sameCTR-003 rechargeable battery, which was originally built into the Nintendo 3DS.

Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on Thursday, June 5, Nintendo announced Wednesday during itsNintendo Directshowcase dedicated to the new console.
Nintendo will have two options available at launch: a base version that includes the Switch 2 console for $449.99, and a bundled version that includes a digital copy ofMario Kart Worldfor $499.99.Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2will start on April 9.
Switch 2 comes with the following, according to Nintendo:
A handful of games from Nintendo will be available at launch, includingMario Kart World,Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, and upgraded Nintendo Switch 2 Edition versions ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
The launch of Switch 2 will arrive more than eight years after the original Switch, which Nintendo released in March 2017 for $299. At $449.99, the Switch 2 will be Nintendo’s most expensive console at launch, not accounting for inflation. Currently, Nintendo sells three models of the original Switch, ranging from $199.99 for the Switch Lite to $349.99 for the Switch OLED Model.

The Nintendo Switch 2 uses fast microSD Express cards — here’s where can you buy one,2025-04-02T13:23:45Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/549531/switch-2-microsd-express-card-specs-price-where-to-buy,"Still just as small, but this microSD type has SSD speeds
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
We’ve suspected that theNintendo Switch 2will use microSD cards, just like the original Switch, for the purpose of storing more games than can fit on its internal storage. But Nintendo shared during its Direct showcase that the Switch 2 supports microSD Express cards, which retain the same size and shape of microSD cards, but boastgreatlyenhanced read and write speeds.
Will you need one when the Switch 2 launches on June 5? Yes, as regular microSD cards will not work in the new console for the purpose of playing games. However, you can insert one to look at screenshots and videos that were captured on your original Switch, perNintendo’s support article. The good news if you buy a microSD Express card? They’re backwards compatible with all supported original Switch games. The not-so-good news? They’re kind of expensive.
Compared to the tremendous value of buying a high-capacity microSD card, where $75 or so can get you 1 TB, microSD Express cards aremuchmore expensive at the moment. That’s partially because only a couple of companies manufacture microSD Express cards. Plus, while the tech is a handful of years old, the Switch 2 is the first mainstream gaming device to support it.
As mentioned above, there’s a good reason for the price increase: these cards are classified as NVMe SSDs. To that end, they can read and write data about four times faster than your run-of-the-mill microSD card, resulting in faster everything, from downloads, updates, and loading. It’s likely system boot times will be faster, too.
Correction: A previous version of this story indicated that microSD cards aren’t compatible with the Switch 2 at all. They are supported in a limited fashion when inserted into the Switch 2. Users can only look at screenshots and videos, not access games or saves.

byIan Walker
After months of speculation, we now know what happens when you press the Switch 2’s mysterious C button thanks totoday’s Nintendo Direct presentation.
The C button is all about GameChat, a new Switch 2 feature that looks a lot like Discord video chat. It allows you to communicate with friends in both handheld and docked modes using a microphone built into the gamepad as well as share your screen.
GameChat even works between people playing different games. Nintendo has also included built-in parental controls that will make it necessary for kids to get permission to use these features.
Switch 2 will also launch with a camera that puts you on screen, either overlaid on top of the gameplay or by yourself.
Nintendo Switch Online will be required to use GameChat, but the feature will be available without a membership through March 31, 2026.
The C buttonfirst appearedas a new, unmarked Joy-Con button during the Switch 2 revealback in January. Speculation as to its purposebegan immediately. Most thought about functionality first, guessing it might be for sharing screenshots or launchinga Miiverse-style social media hub, but others went a more silly route by envisioning the button as summoning the late, great Peter Falk as Lieutenant Frank Columbo or making a funny noise and nothing else.

Mario Kart World goes open-world and off-road on Nintendo Switch 2,2025-04-02T13:13:32Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551079/mario-kart-switch-2-release-date-details,"Nintendo follows up its biggest hit ever with a Switch 2 launch title
byOli Welsh
As suggested by theinitial Switch 2 reveal, the big launch game for Nintendo’s new system will be an all-new Mario Kart. It’s calledMario Kart Worldand will launch alongside the console on June 5, Nintendo revealed duringWednesday’s Switch 2 Direct. The game has a $79.99 price tag, although you can getMario Kart Worldfor less if you pre-order it as part of aSwitch 2 bundle priced at $499.99.
Mario Kart Worldis an open-world racing game in the style of Forza Horizon, in which fields of 24 racers compete across a huge map with different regions. It has many features associated with more realistic racing games, including a photo mode, dynamically changing weather conditions, and time-of-day that will affect the racing experience.
Players will be able to go off-road and drive “virtually everywhere in this world” in a free-roam mode, while the drive from one race to another during a traditional Mario Kart four-course Grand Prix will be an integral “part of the competition.” Knockout Tour races are a new battle royale-style variant that see players racing from one side of the map to the other, getting knocked out at checkpoints as they go.
The trailer showed off a wide variety of custom vehicles, including snowmobiles, jet skis, and karts adapted for actual flight — not just gliding. On some levels, it’s possible to perform the Mario Kart equivalent of wall-running and grinding rails. The cast of characters encompassed all the Mario Kart favorites and a few wild cards (like a playable cow), and it seemed as though custom outfits will be a thing inMario Kart World.
There’ll be more detailed aboutMario Kart Worldin a dedicated Nintendo Direct on April 17.
Nintendo’s focus onMario Kart Worldat the launch of the Switch 2 is easy to explain: Its predecessor,Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, has been a smash hit on the original Switch, selling an astonishing 67 million copies. It’s the best-selling Switch game by a large margin. In fact, if you add sales of the original Wii U version to bring the total to almost 76 million,Mario Kart 8is thefifth-best-selling game of all time. It’s also, arguably, Nintendo’s biggest hit ever —Wii Sportshas shipped more copies, but that was bundled free with the Wii console in many territories.Mario Kart 8was so successful that Nintendo kept adding to it throughout the Switch’s lifespan, unleashing six waves of new courses and characters through the Booster Course pass.
So it’s no surprise that Nintendo should peg Switch 2 marketing to a hugely popular series that both defined and dominated the kart racing genre, and that has been a perennial on every Nintendo system sinceSuper Mario Kartdebuted on the SNES in 1992. Mario Kart is one of the biggest games series in the world. WillMario Kart Worldcontinue the trend?
Update: This article has been updated to includeMario Kart World’s price.

Everything announced at Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct,2025-04-02T13:07:00Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/550857/switch-2-direct-all-games-news-trailers,"A mix of games, hardware, and Switch 1-compatible reveals
byMatt Patches
After months of speculation, Nintendo announcedthe Switch 2 consoleon Jan. 16 — and that was about it. With close-ups of the new unit and a few shots of a (theoretical) new Mario Kart, Nintendo went the Nintendo route of meeting extreme demand by doing whatever the hell it wanted on whatever timetable it felt like. The reveal came with a promise: more news on April 2.
The day has come. Inan hourlong Nintendo Direct presentationon Wednesday morning, Nintendo unveiled much, much, much more about its plans for Switch 2, which launches in June. To quote Mario: WAHOO! Here’s what went down.
TheNintendo Switch 2 will be released worldwide on June 5, 2025. In the U.S., the console by itself will cost $449.99, while a $499.99 package will be bundled with a digital copy of the launch titleMario Kart World. Nintendo will begintaking pre-orders on April 9, one week from now.
A new Mario Kart game was teased during the Switch 2’s initial reveal, but now it’s official:Mario Kart Worldis arriving for the console’s launch.
This version’s twist: The weather changes, off-roading is highly encouraged, and you keep on driving to the next course? Packing in 24 racers in each race makes this the most open-world experience of any Mario Kart, and there’s the promise of tons of social multiplayer modes.
Get ready for a revolutionary pitch: You can now communicate with friends and family while playing a game!
The Switch 2 has a microphone built into the console itself, versus the controller, but Nintendo promises that even if your bro is blending a protein shake in the same room, noise canceling tech makes it no problem to keep talking without a headset.
Nintendo emphasized the use of parental controls in order to contrast itself to the Wild West of Discord. But the big reveal? Turns out that Switch 2’s mysterious C button launches GameChat.
Nintendo is reinventing Zoom. While you can play your games and talk to your buds using GameChat, the new camera accessory — arriving at launch — can give your multiplayer sessions a video-call-esque twist.
While the Switch allowed for local play on one console using two Joy-Cons, the Switch 2’s GameShare function will allow pals to to play each other in a local setting using a single shared game — even if the friend doesn’t own a copy.
All the new technology packed into the Switch 2 excited the team at Nintendo so much, they decided to make an entire game that allows player to learn about and experiment with the various features. InNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, which feels like the Nintendo equivalent ofAstro’s Playroomon PlayStation 5, puts players in charge of a lil’ guy who goes around exploring a giant version of the console, as well as playing minigames that take advantage of the Joy-Con 2’s motion controls and mouse capabilities.
There are three types of games playable on Switch 2: Switch 2 exclusives, Switch 1 backward-compatible games, and “Nintendo Switch 2 Edition” games, which upgrade Switch titles with console-specific enhancements.Super Mario Party Jamboree, for instance, will be rereleased (but free to current owners) with new games like Bowser Live, which sees the king koopa doing karaoke? And the player sings? Lots of wacky stuff — but it’s all possible with the Switch 2’s more interactive capabilities.
Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomwill also receive enhanced editions for the Switch 2, boasting upgraded graphics and HDR support, plus a GPS-like Nintendo app integration that can direct you to hidden korok seeds. ATears-specific add-on lets friends share Zonai device builds using QR codes on the Nintendo app.
Optimized for the Joy-Con 2’s motion controls, this new game drops players into a wheelchair basketball match. Yes, Nintendo did aMurderball. The trailer shows of the unique moves needed to score and outpace your opponents.
Elden Ring,Split Fiction,Hogwarts Legacy,Hades 2,Street Fighter 6,Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4,Hitman World of Assassination, andCyberpunk 2077were among the many Switch 2 ports revealed during the Nintendo Direct. And a number of games, includingCivilization 7, will implement the Joy Con 2’s new mouse functionality.
Zelda is back for Switch 2, in the classic way Nintendo is known for before tentpole Zelda releases. The next installment ofthe hack-and-slash Hyrule Warriors seriesis a prequel toTears of the Kingdom, and chronicles the Imprisoning War, which was detailed over cutscenes in the original game. Now you can play them! The game will launch this winter.
Dreams can come true. Nintendo confirmed GameCube games will officially hit its online platform when Switch 2 launches in June. And the company will release a brand-new GameCube controller, complete with a GameChat-friendly C button, for the full nostalgic feel. Some major titles were teased in the presentation:The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Soulcalibur 2, andF-Zero GX— complete with multiplayer mode!
While fans probably expectedElden Ring Nightreignnews, and prayed for moreBloodborne, FromSoftware instead made a huge splash at the direct with something totally original. Full of mythical beasties, razor-sharp weapons, swirling magic, and gothic architecture, it’s calledThe Duskbloods. Nintendo promised we’d know much more information on the game — which will be available exclusively on Switch 2 — before it launches in 2026.
Kirby Air Ridersis a sequel to GameCube’sKirby Air Ride, and finds the puffy hero zipping around on stars once again. Two racing games promised for Switch 2? Classic Nintendo. But the nostalgia is real forKirby Air Riders, and the new game aims to faithfully reproduce its prismatic thrills. The game will launch in 2025.
The redesigned Donkey Kong, who reverted to his more retro look after a reintroduction inThe Super Mario Bros. Movie, is finally getting a new, stand-alone 3D platformer. DK will be smashing through an underground world dubbed Ingot Isle, in a game that looks like a worthy successor to his earlier adventures. The game drops the month after the Switch 2 launch, on July 17.

It’s been a huge few days for the Switch 2, with a jam-packedNintendo Directand our first opportunity to get hands on the console and try some of the new games and features. While a lot of the reveals have been exciting (Moo Moo inMario Kart!), the steep prices for theSwitch 2andgameshaveleft many questioningwhether investing in the new console is worth the cost.
We were lucky enough to get totry out the Switch 2, and theJoy Cons’ new mouse mode, and our early impressions can give you a sense of what to expect when the console launches in June. Below, you can find all of our Switch 2 coverage from this week, including news, takeaways, and analyses.

After many months, if not years, ofleaksand speculation, it’s finally official: Nintendohas announcedandfully revealedits next console. It’s calledNintendo Switch 2, and as the name implies, it’s a very similar design to the Switch — a hybrid handheld console with detachable controllers that can be connected to a TV via a dock.
While it may seem an obvious move, the iterative system is an unusual strategy for Nintendo, which has often chosen to innovate with its new hardware, finding new control systems and new forms of play. But, with 150 million units sold after eight years on the market, the Switch is Nintendo’s second most successful gaming system ever (after the Nintendo DS), and thethird-best-selling console of all time. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the company decided, for once, that its previous console design wasn’t broken and didn’t need fixing. Switch 2 also launches into a changed market, where players have come to expect that they will be able to carry their game libraries forward from one machine to another, which precluded a radical change.
Christopher Grant
January’s Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event took the wraps off the console, but left a lot of details unanswereduntil now. After the initial reveal, I put togetheran analysis of the possible pricingfor the console, using Nintendo’s own historical pricing strategies to guide my thinking. My conclusion then was that it would cost $399.
I…was wrong. The Nintendo Switch 2 will debut in Junestarting at $449.99, with a $499.99 version that includesMario Kart World.

We have a full view ofNintendo Switch 2 gamesnow theApril 2 Directhas come and gone — including a number of exclusives andlaunch titles, and that all-importantrelease datefor the console itself.
It follows months of slim pickings following the console’s initial hardware-focused reveal in January, which also saw developers and publishers holding fire of their involvement until now.
Cameron Faulkner
The Nintendo Switch 2 is launching onJune 5. Pre-orders were initially going live on Wednesday,April 9, but those plans have been postponed due toNintendo assessing the “potential impact of tariffs.” A new pre-order date will be shared at a later time.
The original article follows below.
Cameron Faulkner
Following the new tariffs instated by the Trump administration, the originalApril 9 pre-order date for the Nintendo Switch 2 has been postponed. The new pre-order day hasn’t been set, and will be shared by Nintendo at a later date. ItsJune 5 release dateis unchanged.
The original article follows below.

During anhourlong presentation on Wednesday, Nintendo bombarded prospective Switch 2 buyers with information about the new console and its games, including a torrent of ports from third-party publishers. But, once the dust had settled, it was easy to succumb to a creeping anxiety. Where were all the first-party launch titles from Nintendo itself?Mario Kart Worldlooks great, but isit $79.99 great?
Yes and no. Depending on how you define a launch game — and how you define a Switch 2 game — the Switch 2 will launch with anywhere between one and nine Nintendo games. You don’t have to expand these definitions to the absolute limit to realize that the Switch 2 is launching with relatively strong first-party support compared to Nintendo’s past systems. But it is true that Nintendo is approaching this launch a little differently.
Chelsea Stark
There’s a lot to talk about since theSwitch 2 reveal, and one of the jokey-but-not questions from many folks is:Will the Switch 2 mouse work on my pants?
Which makes sense! Rarely are we doing handheld or console gaming with a table in front of us, let alone a large, luxurious desk mat like the ones at theNintendo Switch 2hands-on event held in New York. I already wrote a bit onhow it feels to play with the Joy-Con’s mouse feature, but let’s get specific: How well does it work on pants? And various other non-mousepad surfaces?
Oli Welsh
During Wednesday’sSwitch 2 Direct, Nintendo revealed that some games for the original Switch could be upgraded to enhancedSwitch 2 Editionsby purchasing an upgrade pack. This isn’t surprising, coming from a company that has long loved to repackage old games for new consoles and sell them to fans a second (or third, or fourth) time. But it left some observers feeling that Nintendo was nickel-and-diming its fans — and it’s a strategy that comes with risks.
When launching a console that’sfully backward-compatible with its predecessor’s games, console makers have some tricky choices to make. One of the trickiest involves how to handle pricing and upgrades when there are versions of the same game for both platforms — particularly if the platform holder is increasing the price of games on the new system (as Nintendo is).
Alice Jovanée
Perhaps one of the more unexpected announcements to arrive out of the Nintendo Switch Direct is that theNintendo Switch 2will have a camera peripheral to supplement the console’s new group chat feature. While the Switch 2 will be compatible withthird-party USB-C webcams, the peripheral manufacturers at Hori are already producing their own adorable version of a camera for the Switch 2 modeled after the Piranha Plant.
Specifics surrounding the carnivorous camera are a bit slim. It isn’t currently advertised on the manufacturer’s website, and it has only been spotted in the wild at European retailerMediamarkt, which has the product listed for around $44, about $6 cheaper than thefirst-party model advertised by Nintendo. It appears that the stem will be detachable from the base and is flexible, to ensure you have the best possible angle. However, the coolest feature is that its mouth can be closed as a privacy shutter for the camera when not in use. Nintendo’s official camera for the Switch 2 has a similar feature, but I’m glad we’re already starting to see weird peripherals for the new console taking root.
Ian Walker
A slew of new amiibo were quietly revealed in addition toall the Switch 2 infoshared on April 2, confirming details gleaned from Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filingsa month ago.
Thenew figures, based on characters fromThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the KingdomandStreet Fighter 6, will launch alongside theSwitch 2on June 5. Six Sage descendants Tulin, Yunobo, Riju, and Sidon represent the Zelda franchise, while Street Fighter newcomers Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly join the previously released Ryu and Ken figures as part of the fighting game’s amiibo offerings.
Cameron Faulkner
A custom Nvidia processor is at the heart of theNintendo Switch 2, giving it power to push up to 120 frames per second in handheld mode, or up to 4K at 60 frames per second while docked.
While Nintendo has been cagey to share more details on its partnership with the graphics and AI giant, Nvidia published ashort press releaseconfirming the collaboration — and diving a little more deeply into the tech found in Nintendo’s surprisingly capable handheld.
Zoë Hannah
Nintendo held off announcing the price of theSwitch 2in its bigSwitch 2 Directon Wednesday. Instead, perhaps in preparation for the inevitable sticker shock, the $449 price point was slipped into a news release tucked away in a bevy of other facts. Nintendo also announced that a limited-supply bundle that comes with a copy ofMario Kart Worldwould retail for $499.99. The Mario Kart sequel runs $80 as a standalone game.
Even with rampant inflation of the U.S. economy, theSwitch 2 remains one of Nintendo’s most expensive consoles ever. Further, it’s crossing theonce-sacred $70 price pointfor games — a relatively ubiquitous price for AAA games that most major studios generally adhere to. (That price point has crept up over the years, with first-party Switch 1 games going for $60 in most cases.)
Chelsea Stark
Mario Kart Worldanswers the question, “How do you followMario Kart 8?” While the previous entry became fully stuffed with new and throwback racetracks, playingMario Kart Worldat Nintendo’s hands-onSwitch 2preview event blew up all my assumptions of what a Mario Kart track can be — and what the future could hold for the franchise.
The arcade racer hasn’t yet strayed from its format, but that’s about to change whenMario Kart Worldis released alongside the Switch 2 on June 5. In the time I spent withMario Kart Worldduring the preview event, I most enjoyed all the times I wasn’t strictly racing. I was just driving and vibing.
Russ Frushtick
While watching the bigNintendo Switch 2 Direct, I’m sure I wasn’t alone in expecting the long-awaited follow-up toSuper Mario Odyssey. When the final trailer kicked off with lush, cartoony environs, it seemed clear that the expectation was about to become reality. But nope, Nintendo’s big surprise game was actuallyDonkey Kong Bananza, a new 3D adventure game starring the king of the Kongs.
But is this just a palette swap? Maybe the developers wanted to make a new 3D platformer, but to mix it up they slotted in Donkey Kong instead of Mario. Effectively, is this the sequel toMario Odysseywe’ve been waiting for?
Russ Frushtick
If you were handed aNintendo Switch 2, you might not initially realize it. Sure, it might feel a little bigger in the hand, but otherwise the experience of holding Nintendo’s long-awaited follow-up feels familiar, with all the pluses and minuses that go along with that.
Delving a bit deeper, though, the improvements do become apparent. You just have to hunt for them.
Chelsea Stark
Nintendo announced that its Switch 2 Joy-Cons could beused as a mouse— in either hand, even — during itsSwitch 2 Directon April 2. Mice and other pointers have been aiding in making certain game movements more precise for decades, so the idea of a console-based mouse is tempting, if it’s implemented well.
During a hands-on event in New York City on Wednesday, I was able to test the Joy-Cons’ mouse mode on a few different gameplay experiences specifically designed to highlight it. Nintendo is a company known for unique (or sometimes gimmicky) implementations of control schemes, yet the mouse has had decades of refinement for computer gaming. Some of the experiences I had using the Joy-Con as a mouse felt traditional, but some left me scratching my head as to whether they would receive wider adoption.
Tyler Colp
On top of the improved graphical performance for theSwitch 2 versions ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom, there will be a suite of new features in the Nintendo Switch phone app, including an achievement system and, strangely, a voice navigation assistant.
The new service inside the Switch app is called Zelda Notes. It only works for theSwitch 2versions, and is “designed to provide a more streamlined gameplay experience,” according to theoverview trailer.
Christopher Grant
It’s a good thing that theNintendo Switch 2comes with a base 256 GB of internal storage — eight times more than the original Switch’s paltry 32 GB — because some Nintendo Switch 2 games won’t come on the cartridge at all. Instead, so-called game-key cards will simply contain a “key” that you will use to download the game, according toa support page on Nintendo’s website.
“After it’s downloaded, you can play the game by inserting the game-key card into your system and starting it up like a standard physical game card,” the page reads. Here’s how that looks on the retail packaging:
Tyler Colp
Navigating the eShop on the Nintendo Switch is a trial. Not only does it chug when you’re scrolling through games, it’s borderline impossible to find exactly what you want. Even new games are sometimes hard to find. And there areentire websitesdedicated to doing the heavy lifting for you so you don’t ever have to engage with it. It’s a mess that hasn’t been cleaned up for years.
According to Nintendo developers in arecent official interview, Switch 2’s updated eShop won’t be as awful to use.

Nintendo confirmed back in November 2024, two months before the company evenunveiled the Nintendo Switch 2, that the new console would bebackward-compatible with games for the original Nintendo Switch. Now, after detailing the system’s hardware and software in anhourlong Nintendo Direct presentation, the company has provided the first real specifics on the nature of Switch 2’s backward compatibility.
We now know that theSwitch 2will work with many Switch accessories — including, most importantly, the original console’s Joy-Cons and Pro Controller — as well as games. But as Nintendo has previously hinted, not every Switch game will be playable (or, at least, fully playable) on the Switch 2. Here’s what we’ve learned so far.
Michael McWhertor
Donkey Kong will break new ground in his newSwitch 2game,Donkey Kong Bananza. I mean that literally, in the sense that the 3D action-adventure game is about destruction and digging into the hard earth with DK’s meaty fists. ButBananzawill also push the Donkey Kong series forward by putting pants on Nintendo’s iconic ape. That’s right, Donkey Kong is no longer just weirdly wearing a tie but otherwise completely naked; this Kong wears trousers (and suspenders).
Do we have actor, producer, andceramics enthusiastSeth Rogento thank for this? Maybe.

Nintendo’s Switch 2 Directstream suffered technical issues at the most inopportune time for the developers ofAstroneer. Near the end of Wednesday’s presentation, a trailer for their new game debuted on the stream during a period where many viewers were stuck looking at a glitchy mess.
“Hey so uh one of the mainNintendo Switch 2 Directstreams completely ate our trailer due to I guess technical difficulties?” System Era Softworks social media manager Lotus Dwyer wrote onBluesky.
Chris Plante
Nintendo took an unusual approach to the past two decades of video game console wars. It stayed out of them. But with today’sNintendo Switch 2 info dump— packed with big-name third-party games rarely seen onNintendo hardware— the House that Mario Built appears ready to rejoin the fray. Why now? Credit a collision of confidence, opportunity, and necessity.
Sony and Microsoft have spent generations bloodying each other in a battle for the most extravagant visuals, courting favor with major publishers like Activision and Electronic Arts. Meanwhile, Nintendo swam in the opposite direction, favoring cheaper, less powerful machines that prioritized toy-like novelty over raw specs.
Michael McWhertor
We knew there was a new Mario Kart coming to Switch 2, but we didn’t expect it to cost this much. After showing off the open-world racing gameMario Kart Worldon Wednesday during itsSwitch 2 Nintendo Directshowcase, Nintendo revealed that the game will have a $79.99 price tag. That’s new territory for Nintendo, which just two years ago made headlines bycharging $69.99forThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
ButMario Kart World’s high asking price doesn’t appear to be the standard for Switch 2 software. Nintendo also confirmed Wednesday thatDonkey Kong Bananza, coming to Switch 2 in July, will cost $69.99. Still, these are indicators that Nintendo is comfortable charging more not just for the Switch successor, but for its next-gen games too.

Thefull revealof theNintendo Switch 2was largely focused on all the new games you can play. The hardware specs weren’t the focus, but Nintendo dropped a detailed list of what’s inside the Switch 2 on its website. Most of what we knew from the original announcement video and some leaks turned out to be true: It’s a bigger, better handheld console with a full slate of upgraded hardware.
Here’s what we now know, specs-wise, about the Nintendo Switch 2.

A big new Donkey Kong 3D platforming adventure is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo announced Wednesday during itsNintendo Directshowcase dedicated to the new console. It’s calledDonkey Kong Bananza, and it will send (fresh new look) Donkey Kong to heretofore unexplored, underground territories where he’ll smash, grab, and throw things at anyone who stands in his way.
Donkey Kong Bananzawill be released on July 17, about six weeks after theNintendo Switch 2 launchesin June, and it’ll cost $69.99.

All our predictions for the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct,2025-04-01T19:16:59Z,https://www.polygon.com/analysis/550710/switch-2-nintendo-direct-predictions,"Less than 24 hours remain until Nintendo’s big Switch 2 Direct
byMichael McWhertor
It’s the dawn of the final day. On Wednesday, April 2, Nintendo promises to give its fans a closer look atSwitch 2, the successor to its wildly popular portable-console hybrid. And while Nintendo is famously secretive and unpredictable, there’s a lot we already know about Switch 2.
Still, there are manyunanswered questions about Switch 2, and Nintendo’s ability to keep information under wraps and preserve surprises means that what we think we know about the next-generation Switch likely pales in comparison to whatthis week’s 60-minute Nintendo Directwill reveal.
That said, here are our best predictions for the impending Nintendo Direct that’s all about Switch 2.
With the Switch 2 expected to launch as early as June, Nintendo will likely reveal the release date, price, and when customers can pre-order the system. Based on what we’ve heard,Switch 2 pre-orders should go live at most retailers on April 9, giving Nintendo fans a window to consider their purchases and not have to scramble to pre-order one immediately after the Nintendo Direct. (In some territories, like Nintendo’s home base in Japan, the Direct won’t conclude until late at night.)
Switch 2, based on what we’ve heard, is expected to launch in the first half of June.
We expect the price to besomewhere between $399 and $449. Nintendo may be waiting until the very last minute to decide price, which — inthiseconomy — seems like a tough decision to make.
Nintendo not only added a brand-new button to the Switch 2 Joy-Cons, it’s beenteasing that new C button’s functionalityahead of time on its recently launched Nintendo Today app. What the C button does is still a mystery for now, but all signs point to a new chat tool or community-focused feature.
We’ll find out what the C button is for, officially, on Wednesday. But based on Nintendo’s increasing fascination with big multiplayer games, and last year’sNintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program, which tested “the boundaries of mass multiplayer functionality and gameplay” on Nintendo’s servers, we expect some sort of big, Nintendo-controlled community feature or MMO-scale game to be shown — and that would be a great opportunity to showcase the new C button functionality, if it is indeed chat- or community-focused.
We’re getting a new Mario Kart, that’s for sure. But what else Nintendo has planned for Switch 2 is a big mystery. We expect at least one game to show off theSwitch 2 Joy-Cons’ new mouse-control featuresand probably a new Super Mario game.
Nintendo also has to give Switch owners a long list of reasons to upgrade to Switch 2, and the best way to do that is through compelling software.Mario Kart 9would be a big deal, of course, but we expect Nintendo to show up with a teaser or announcement of at least one other big franchise, like Animal Crossing, Super Smash Bros., or Splatoon.
But Nintendo will also likely showcase how well Switch games run on Switch 2. Maybe the best way to do that would be to showThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildorTears of the Kingdomrunning on Switch 2, at higher resolution and with better frame rates. First details on“Switch 2 Edition” versions of gameswill definitely be a talking point.
Third-party software publishers will likely open the floodgates of their back catalogs to bring games from PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X to a new console. But don’t expect that flood of ports to be showcased at the Nintendo Direct. Instead, we anticipate that only a handful of major third-party publishers like Capcom, Sega, Microsoft, and Ubisoft will get some space during the Direct to show their support for Switch 2.
Nintendo is reportedly being cautious about which third-party developers are getting Switch 2 development kits ahead of launch, but we expect that to change once details about the new system are in the wild.

Why this possible C-button sound effect has us hoping for Miiverse on the Switch 2,2025-04-01T17:50:18Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/550523/switch-2-c-button-mii-miiverse-sound-effect-tease-joy-con,"What do you hear?
byIan Walker
A new post in theNintendo Today appteases the potential functionality of thatC button we’ve all been discussingfor months with a very Mii-like sound effect as part of the countdown toWednesday’s Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct.
If you live in a region where it’s already April 2, you may have seen a short Nintendo Today video specifically promoting the C button. Over the course of seven seconds, we’re shown aJoy-Con attached to a Nintendo Switch 2before a quick zoom into the C button. A finger presses the button. The button makes asound. The sound is a nonsensical mixture of an activation jingle and what sounds likea Mii speaking.
Does this mean Miis are back? Maybe! And maybe it’s a sign Nintendo is launching a Miiverse-like social media platform —a fan favorite featurefrom the Wii U and 3DS era — that will be launched with the C button. Listen to the sound above about a million times and get back to us.
When Nintendo first revealed the Switch 2back in January, the new Joy-Cons showcased alongside the device featured a mysterious, unmarked button. Everyonealmost immediately assumedthis meant the C button was returning after it skipped multiple console generations, speculation that was awardedearlier this weekthanks to another Nintendo Today post. Even so, we’ve remained in the dark as to what the C buttonactually does.
Whether the C button opens a new Miiverse-style chatting app, allows for saving screenshots and video recordings, or just makes a funny noise and nothing else, we’re almost certain to learn more during tomorrow’s Switch 2 presentation. Stay tuned!

Nintendo’s new doomscrolling alternative app has one great feature,2025-03-31T19:26:45Z,https://www.polygon.com/impressions/549801/nintendo-today-app,"After conquering the alarm clock, Nintendo makes a good calendar
byMichael McWhertor
Nintendo now has a way to distance itself from toxic social media platforms it can’t control with a new daily news app called Nintendo Today. While Nintendo Today in its current state is little more than a thinly populated newsfeed, the app’s calendar feature might make the thing worth installing.
Four months ago, Nintendoreleased a Spotify-like appthat only plays Nintendo music. Appropriately namedNintendo Music, the app gives the Mario and Zelda maker the means to control how fans listen to its games’ themes and soundtracks, officially, without having to rely on (or share revenue with) a third party.
Nintendo made a similar move with the Nintendo Switch Online app, a messaging and chat platform that serves as an alternative to messaging platforms like Discord — which has been integrated by rivals Sony and Microsoft on their consoles. The NSO app includes game-specific services (like Nooklink forAnimal Crossing: New Horizons), but the main draw is supposed to be interacting with your online friends and using voice chat during online play. You know, stuff many people would actually prefer to do on Discord.
Nintendo Today is Nintendo’s latest attempt to carve out its own space, where it can send news directly to its fanbase. Like its famous Nintendo Direct presentations, the app seems like a way to bypass media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and X (formerly Twitter), which have become exponentially less pleasant to engage with as time progresses.
The company has already used Nintendo Today to break news. On Friday morning, less than 24 hours after announcing the app, the company placed a 25-second video at the top of the feedannouncing the 2027 release date for the live-action movie based on The Legend of Zelda. It has also “leaked”new images of the Switch 2itself. The newsfeed also includes a few timely morsels, like a countdown to this week’sNintendo Direct: Switch 2 showcaseand a few trailers from thelatest Nintendo Direct. The feed is otherwise populated with supplementary fluff, like a brief history of the Fire Emblem series, orchestral performances of video game music, and funny “pearls of wisdom” from Animal Crossing’s beloved otter, Pascal.
Nintendo Today’s attempt at newsbreaking comes with a fault, at least at launch. Despite having opted in to notifications from the app, Nintendo Today didn’t actually alert me to Friday’s news about The Legend of Zelda movie. I had to (gasp!) actuallyopen the app manuallyin the morning to check what was new for myself. Hopefully, like the app’s brief second-day outage, these are just growing pains.
It’s Nintendo Today’s calendar, though, that will likely keep the app installed on my phone. In addition to delivering adorable daily animations based on Nintendo series like Pikmin, Super Mario, and Animal Crossing, there’s surprisingly useful information in here. The calendar keeps track of past and upcoming events, like Nintendo Direct streams and real-world events like the opening of Nintendo’s San Francisco retail store. It also tracks release dates for games and demos, and in-game events. Thanks to the latter feature, I can now keep tabs on upcoming events forAnimal Crossing: New Horizons, ensuring I never miss a Bunny Day or fishing tourney.
Nintendo Today’s calendar currently keeps track of in-game events for 11 titles, includingSplatoon 3,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Tetris 99, andMario Kart Tour. As someone with a short attention span who relies on various notifications to keep me informed and on task, I’m looking forward to seeing how well the app can help me keep track of real-world and virtual events. (Frankly, I’m also greatly anticipating things like release dates leaking through the app. That’s bound to happen.)
Like other Nintendo-developed smart-device apps, Nintendo Today is a slick but nascent tool that does about half of what I’d ideally want it to do. It’s doubtful that Nintendo Today will ever achieve the goal of fully replacing any of services like Facebook, Instagram, and X, at least from a news-delivery perspective, but it’s off to a decent start.

Playing Nintendo’s greatest triumph on its biggest failure,2025-03-28T21:38:57Z,https://www.polygon.com/zelda/547697/breath-of-the-wild-wii-u,"Thoughts on revisiting the forgotten Wii U version of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
byOli Welsh
AsShigeru Miyamoto never actually said, “A delayed game is eventually good, but a bad game is forever bad.” This sliding-doors concept gains an additional, poignant dimension when consideringThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, because that game’s delay affected more than its quality. Originally planned for release in 2015 as a Wii U exclusive,Breath of the Wild’s shift to early 2017 moved it onto the launch lineup for the Nintendo Switch. It went from propping up a failed console to becoming the game thatdefined the Switch, and redefined Nintendo, for a whole new era.
That halo has made it easy to forget that the Wii U version ofBreath of the Wildwas actually released. Not for the first time, Nintendo chose a Zelda game to play the dual role of swan song for one generation and curtain-raiser for another (appropriately for the Zelda series, with its preoccupation with the closed loop of history). In 2006,Twilight Princesswas released on both the outgoing GameCube and the brand-new Wii. On that occasion, you could see the cracks. The Wii’s novel motion controller was an awkward fit forTwilight Princess, and the game’s deliberate classicism clashed with the bright, casual, carefully neutral aesthetic Nintendo was advancing with other launch titles likeWii Sports. It was clearly a GameCube holdover in ill-fitting clothing.
Nintendo was not about to let the same thing happen toBreath of the Wild— this time, it optimized the game for the new console and retrofitted it into the old. Firing the Wii U version up recently, I found exactly the same game that had seared itself into our collective consciousness. Producer Eiji Aonuma, director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, and their team had taken care to stamp out anything that might have tied it to the idiosyncrasies of the Wii U hardware.
If anything, it is the Wii U version that feels out of place, mostly due to its performance issues. Nintendo took advantage of the small amount of extra headroom afforded by the Switch’s specs to output a higher-resolution image when docked, and to push the physics engine and environmental detail past the point the Wii U was comfortable with. Mostly,Breath of the Wildplays great on Wii U, but it suffers from a very choppy frame rate when subjecting Bokoblins to physics-based carnage, panning past deep vistas of the Hyrule landscape, or visiting densely detailed locations like Kakariko Village.
It’s not unplayable, but not what you expect of Nintendo; that the company was happy to live with this level of performance says a lot about the extent to which it had already moved on from the Wii U. The game also looks a little hazy and washed-out by comparison to the Switch version, whether played in 720p on a big TV or on the Wii U Gamepad’s inferior screen.
Otherwise, though,Breath of the Wildis entirely uncompromised on Wii U. Or is it? Playing the game on a TV, with the chunky slab of the Gamepad in your hands, you get a faint, vestigial sense of a more bespoke Wii U experience that might have been. When Link collects his Sheikah Slate and downloads a map onto it, it seems like a deliberate echo of the console’s unique dual-screen functionality. Surely we were meant to have the map open in our laps as we played, or to be navigating Link’s inventory on the touchscreen. In fact, Nintendo haddemonstrated touchscreen featuresforBreath of the Wildback in 2014, but stripped them out to ensure total parity with the Switch version — and because, Fujibayashi said, looking between the two screens could be distracting.
PlayingBreath of the Wildon Wii U is very fun becauseBreath of the Wildis very fun. (Have you heard? It’s a good game.) It’s also a little sad, because as misbegotten as the Wii U was,Breath of the Wildshould have been its crowning glory. Instead, this version is a slightly hobbled afterthought living in the shadow of the definitive masterwork it became on another console. It sold 1.7 million copies on Wii U, and 32.6 million on Switch.
Playing such a familiar game in this unfamiliar form brought home to me how prophetic the design of the Wii U was. At the time, it was poorly understood, but without it, the Switch could never have happened. The Wii U wasalmostthe right idea atslightlythe wrong time. The Gamepad’s form factor, which once felt so ungainly, feels totally natural in the era of the Steam Deck. And the magic of instantly switching your gameplay from the TV to the tablet in your hands hasn’t dimmed. This is the entire concept of the Switch, just with the roles reversed.
The other day, I fancied playingBreath of the Wildin the evening, but didn’t want to hide from my family in my office, where the Wii U was plugged in. With a sudden jolt of delight, I realized —remembered— that I could just bring the Gamepad to the sofa and continue playing there. With the Wii U, Nintendo imagined a better world where your gaming could fit around and into your life. With the Switch, it made that world a reality.

The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC and the other new games out this week,2025-03-28T21:09:39Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/546675/best-new-games-releases-march-31-last-of-us-part-2-remastered,"This week’s games balance horror and joy

The new game releases this week waver between horrifying and charming. Sometimes the premise of a game is pretty sad on its face, but the stuff you do isn’t as bleak. That’s the case for a couple games arriving this week. However, that’s not true forThe Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, a game fully committed to misery. There are cheerful moments in it, though, so it technically counts. Just don’t go into it expecting to spend 40 hours riffing on Ellie’s guitar.
Koiradrops just before the rest of the games on the list arrive on Thursday. It’s a game about exploring a forest with a lost puppy, and if I think too hard about where that story might go I’ll cry. Then there’s Naughty Dog’s bleak, post-apocalyptic shooter where you can’t go 45 minutes without watching something awful happen.Sandalso comes out on that day and brings a fun twist to the extraction shooter genre: spider tanks. AndCaligoandSephiriaare two games that look more pleasant than they actually are. One of them lets you play as a bunny warrior, though.
Here are our most anticipated game releases for the week of March 31.
Release date:April 1Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PCThis little adventure game is for dog lovers. Your character finds a puppy and goes on an adventure in a magical, musical forest. It’s like a single-player co-op game as you solve puzzles and work together to find home.
Release date:April 3Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PCJust in time for theHBO show’s second season,The Last of Us Part 2is finally coming to PC. This version will have improved graphics, the No Return roguelike mode, and a whole developer commentary mode to learn how the game was made.
Release date:April 3Platforms:Windows PCMuch likeRust,Sandis another survival game with a straightforward title. OK, it’s more than that: It’s also an extraction shooter where everyone drives weird spider tanks. Basically, the game looks like Mad Max with rocket launchers.
Release date:April 3Platforms:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis dreamlike walking simulator is coming to consoles this week. This game has a variety of places to explore, like pretty fantasy forests and hellish nightmare worlds. This is a game full of surprises.
Release date:April 3Platforms:Windows PCYou’re a bunny in a pixel world of animals, artifacts, and roguelike action. This early access game is all about finding gear and equipping yourself to protect the other animals of the land. And even though it’s not finished yet, it already has four levels and over 250 items to find.

"Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders to start in early April, leaks say",2025-03-28T20:33:27Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/549116/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date-when,"Get your credit cards ready
byMichael McWhertor
Pre-orders for theNintendo Switch 2will open on Wednesday, April 2 — if you believe retailer Best Buy Canada, which announced that pre-order date in a blog post (and thenquickly pulled it) on Thursday. A new report fromInsider Gaming, citing documents from an unnamed “large U.S. retailer,” says pre-orders for Switch 2 will open a week later, on April 9.
Nintendo itself hasn’t announced when pre-orders for Switch 2 will go live, so it’s unclear if the company will start taking pre-orders the same day it holds itsNintendo Direct: Switch 2 showcase(April 2), or if it will give us another week to consider the next-gen system’s merits. Polygon has reached out to Nintendo for comment and will update when the company responds.
While Nintendo hasn’t announced a release date or price for its new system, Switch 2 is expected to launch in early June, meaning that pre-orders would likely be open for about two months.
In between Nintendo’s full reveal of Switch 2 and its expected launch, the company will hold a series ofhands-on Nintendo Switch 2 Experience eventsacross the globe.
Anticipation for the Switch successor is high, and Nintendo is reportedlystockpiling a large number of Switch 2 consolesto meet that demand. That demand may fluctuate based on how much Nintendo will charge for Switch 2, but that’s something we’re bound to know soon enough.

The big questions going into the Switch 2 reveal,2025-03-28T18:30:59Z,https://www.polygon.com/analysis/548500/nintendo-switch-2-questions-before-reveal,"Nintendo’s full reveal will hopefully answer all of these unknowns
byMichael McWhertor
This story was first published in Switchboard, a newsletter from Polygon that delivers all the latest Switch 2 news, reporting, and rumors directly to your inbox.Sign up hereto get it weekly.
This time next week, we’ll know a lot more about theNintendo Switch 2. A newNintendo Direct showcasededicated to the top-secret handheld console will air on the morning of Wednesday, April 2. That presentation will offer a first look at new games, hardware details, and hopefully much more.
Ahead of the event, we have a long list of questions that Nintendo still needs to answer. Here are some of the biggest unknowns about Switch 2.
Some of the biggest questions we’re hoping will be addressed during the Nintendo Direct surround the new Joy-Con controllers. Will they have Hall effect joysticks, as previously reported? And does that mean stick drift is a thing of the past?
How will the rumoredmouse control features of the Joy-Conswork? More crucially, do Joy-Cons actually feel good as mice? Are players going to need a dedicated mousing surface, or will a coffee tabletop or couch surface suffice?
Importantly, how do the new, larger Joy-Cons feel in the hand? Will those bigger shoulder buttons work as well as we’d hoped? And what does thatnew “C” button on the right Joy-Condo?
The Switch’s Joy-Cons were a pretty radical reinvention for game controllers, both revolutionary and quite flawed. That’s why the full reveal of the Joy-Con (2.0) controllers will be so fascinating to watch, to see how Nintendo moves its design forward and fixes the original version’s shortcomings.
Officially, we only know of one Nintendo-developed game coming to Switch 2 at this point: a new Mario Kart game. But Nintendo has reportedly been building up a strong library of internally developed Switch 2 games, and while we have some ideas about which dev teams could be working on which franchises, Nintendo is excellent at keeping secrets and delivering surprises.
Arecurrent-gen Switch games being developed with Switch 2 in mind, meaning will they support higher resolutions and improved frame rates? (Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Editionmay have already answered this question.)
Frankly, I think we’re all wondering which Nintendo franchises will show up during the Switch 2’s first year. Will Nintendo have a new 2D or 3D Mario ready for launch?
Beyond franchises, perhaps the most exciting thing yet to be revealed is the Switch 2’s equivalent ofWii Sports,Nintendo Land, and1-2-Switch— a game or games that will show what the new system is capable of and what differentiates it from the original Switch.
Which third parties will show up for Switch 2? And how strongly? Both Microsoft and Ubisoft seem ready to step in and support Switch 2 with a long line of AAA games that couldn’t fit on a Switch, but seem like a perfect fit for Switch 2.
Microsoft has publicly voiced interest in Switch 2, meaning franchises like Halo, Call of Duty, Forza, and Fallout could make a strong showing on Nintendo’s new console. If Microsoft does fully embrace Switch 2, it could be a windfall not just for the Xbox maker, but for Nintendo fans, who will have a big, broad range of very good franchises to play on their new systems.
Ubisoft is a longtime supporter of Nintendo consoles out of the gate, and it has a back catalog of Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy games from the past decade it could repackage for the new and more powerful Nintendo handheld. Other publishers like Sega, Capcom, and Electronic Arts could follow with remasters and rereleases. Suffice it to say, AAA game makers have a potentially big new revenue stream with Switch 2, and I expect owners of the new system to be flush with choice.
That smorgasbord also includes indie games. Nintendo has shown strong support for independent game developers during the Switch era, with dedicated Indie World showcases, which I expect will continue on Switch 2. Are Switch indie devs like Team Cherry and Supergiant Games ready to drop their long-awaited sequels on Switch 2?
A late spring/early summer release for Switch 2 is looking more and more likely, based on the timing of Nintendo’s hands-on events for the console and Polygon’s own sources. We’ve heard that an early June launch is planned.
If that’s the case, a firm date should be announced at April’s Nintendo Direct. June is just two months away; retailers will need time to get up to speed and customers will need to get pre-orders in for Switch 2’s launch.
A bigger unknown, and one that feels a little fluid at this point, is price. While $399 seems like the sweet spot for Switch 2, a weak yen, fluctuating component costs, and price uncertainty related to tariffs threatened by the Trump administration could have an impact on Nintendo’s pricing decisions. Some analysts arepredicting a potentially higher price— upward of $499 — and if that’s the case, there will be one more question that’s yet to be answered: Will Switch 1 owners pay that much?

Nintendo’s Legend of Zelda movie gets 2027 release date,2025-03-28T13:41:44Z,https://www.polygon.com/movies/548607/zelda-movie-release-date-2027-nintendo,"Release date revealed via Nintendo Today!
byMichael McWhertor
The live-actionThe Legend of Zelda moviewill be released worldwide on March 26, 2027, Nintendo announced Friday. Nintendo revealed the film’s release date through its new smart-device app,Nintendo Today, not through more traditional social media channels like Instagram, YouTube, or X (formerly known as Twitter).
Nintendo’sZelda movie was announced in 2023. Nintendo is partnering with Sony Pictures Entertainment for the project, with The Legend of Zelda co-creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Hollywood veteran Avi Arad producing. Miyamoto said in 2023 that he’d been working on the movie for “many years now.”
Wes Ball, director of the Maze Runner film trilogy andKingdom of the Planet of the Apes, will helm the live-action adaptation of the fantasy franchise.Ball told Polygonlast year that he wants his take on The Legend of Zelda to be more “grounded” and “real,” and not based on fully motion-captured computer graphics.
Nintendo has another movie coming next year: anew animated film set in the world of Super Mario Bros. For the follow-up to 2023’sThe Super Mario Bros. Movie, Shigeru Miyamoto hinted that “We’re thinking about broadening Mario’s world further, and it’ll have a bright and fun story.” The new Super Mario movie is coming to theaters April 3, 2026.
Nintendo’s choice to eschew traditional media channels certainly indicates confidence in its new Nintendo Today app as either a replacement or first choice to deliver news like The Legend of Zelda movie’s release date. That app is available to download from Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store, and requires a Nintendo Account.

Nintendo suggests there will be enhanced Switch 2 versions of some Switch games,2025-03-28T13:24:25Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/548599/nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-enhanced-upgrades,"Small print for Virtual Game Cards mentions ‘Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games’
byOli Welsh
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
In the small print ofan explainerabout its newVirtual Game Cardsystem for digital purchases, Nintendo appeared to confirm that some Switch games will get enhanced versions forSwitch 2— or at any rate, versions native to the Switch 2 console.
A footnote to the article reads, “Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system.” The note also implies that the Switch 2 will use the Virtual Game Card system as well, and will be able to exchange Switch 1 games with an original Switch.
The Switch 2 is confirmed to be fully backward compatible with its predecessor’s software, so it will be able to play (almost) any Switch game regardless. But Nintendo’s mention of “Switch 2 Edition games,” as opposed to “Switch 2 exclusive games,” suggests that some Switch games will get cross-gen versions that run natively on Switch 2 rather than through the backward-compatibility layer.
This opens the door to enhanced versions of back-catalog titles, such asThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, as well as upcoming Switch releases likeMetroid Prime 4: Beyond. It’s an expected move that has been made commonplace by the latest generations of PlayStation and Xbox consoles. But it’s still the first indication from Nintendo that it will go down this route for cross-gen releases.
It remains to be seen whether Nintendo will charge extra for Switch 2 Edition games. Sony did so for some PlayStation 5 upgrades of PlayStation 4 titles, while Microsoft elected to offer what it called Xbox Series X Enhanced versions of Xbox One games for free.
How the Switch 2 handles backward compatibility, and any potential performance enhancements for older games, is one of the bigger questions about the system ahead of itsfull reveal on April 2. This fine print answers one of our questions about it, but many more remain.

Game of the Year 2025 predictions: The front-runners and challengers to come,2025-03-27T21:22:23Z,https://www.polygon.com/awards/546327/game-of-the-year-game-awards-2025-frontrunners,"What’s in pole position for gaming’s top prize? Let’s make some predictions
byOli Welsh
The 11th Game Awards, scheduled for Dec. 11, will come at the end of a watershed year for gaming that will see the launches ofNintendo Switch 2and (in theory)Grand Theft Auto 6. Both of those releases will likely loom large over theGame of the Yearcompetition at the leading awards ceremony for the game industry — the Oscars of gaming, as it were. But they are not the whole story. Even the first few months of 2025 have seen a number of surprisingly strong GOTY contenders come to light.
The Game Awards’ voting bodyis composed of a wide range of international games media (Polygon included), with a 10% contribution from fan voting. There area number of strong indicatorsfor what will perform well in the Game of the Year category. A high Metacritic rating (preferably over 90) is a must; role-playing games and action-adventures are strongly favored, as are games with strong narrative elements; indie and multiplayer games struggle harder for recognition than AAA single-player adventures. We used these metrics to correctly predict last year’s winner,Astro Bot. (We also got four of the six nominees right, and correctly called 14 other categories.)
Below, you’ll find our predictions for the most likely nominees, of which there are six each year, for Game of the Year 2025. Unlike the film industry, where most titles are known quantities well in advance, you never really know what kind of impact a video game will have, or how good it will be, until it’s out. With that in mind, this list only includes games that are already out. We’ll update these rankings throughout the year as new games are released. We’ll also list some likely upcoming contenders, and in future updates, we’ll predict some of the 2025 GOTY race’s dark horses, too.
Why it could win:Critical consensus is still the most reliable indicator of success at The Game Awards, and as the only game released so far this year with a rating over 90 on both Metacritic and OpenCritic, Hazelight’s co-op adventure is the clear front-runner in this regard. It’s got a legacy advantage, too: Hazelight’s previous game,It Takes Two, won GOTY in 2021, and since then has amassed amassive popular following. As a story-led action-adventure,Split Fictionalso belongs to a genre that the Game Awards jury has been known to favor in the past.
Weaknesses:PerhapsIt Takes Two’s win will count against it if jury members are looking for something different to reward. Also, whileIt Takes Two’s intensely personal story about divorce was unquestionably a strength,Split Fictionhas been praised more for its design than its abstract and overworked tale of writers adrift in virtual reality.
Why it could win:This could bethis year’sBlack Myth: Wukong: an ambitious hit game from a developer operating outside the gaming establishment, delivering on core gamers’ ardent desire for massive solo adventures made without compromise.Deliverance 2is a realistic medieval RPG with strong storytelling, and critics really liked it (its Metascore is 88). Another similar game might be the 2015 GOTY winner,The Witcher 3. This is right in The Game Awards’ sweet spot.
Weaknesses:Black Myth: Wukongdidn’t win GOTY— much to its producer’s chagrin. Just likeBlack Myth’s Game Science, Kingdom Come developer Warhorse is considered politically radioactive by some, after founder Daniel Vávra madepro-Gamergate commentsin 2015. Perhaps more to the point, the game is a challenging time sink that isn’t that broadly played among journalists and jurors, despite respectable sales.
Why it could win:Monster Hunter’s steady climb from co-op curio, through handheld sensation, to AAA champion climaxed with the huge sales and glowing reviews ofWilds. It’s slick, it’s gorgeous, and it’s sanded off Monster Hunter’s rough edges. (As a rule, the Game Awards jury isn’t keen on rough edges.)
Weaknesses:AlthoughWildsgestures toward a more conventional RPG storytelling style than previous Monster Hunters, this is still a deeply systemic game in which the equipment grind matters way more than players’ personal investment in the characters, and that’s not The Game Awards’ favorite look for a GOTY winner.
Why it could win:It only missed the deadline for the 2024 awards by a week or two, but MachineGames’ take on the indelible movie hero was swiftly acclaimed for all the things the jury likes to see: strong, performance-led storytelling, polished tech, high production values, a good mix of action and more cerebral play, and Troy Baker. It would almost certainly have been nominated for a GOTY 2024, and April’s PlayStation 5 release will be a big help in keepingGreat Circlein the conversation all the way up until the 2025 nomination process begins.
Weaknesses:PS5 release notwithstanding, 12 months is anawfullylong time to stay relevant in the race. The Game Awards do not typically reward licensed games. And the mid-80s Metacritic and OpenCritic scores are good, but indicate the critical consensus on this game is a little softer than it first appeared.
Why it could win:Obsidian Games’ traditional fantasy RPG is an interesting case. Its initial critical reception was on the soft side, but it has had a long tail and strong word of mouth, as players found its dependable, old-fashioned qualities — satisfying combat, excellent writing, and moreish loot — tough to turn away from. Genre-wise, as an undemanding and strongly narrative-focused RPG, it’s in a Game Awards sweet spot.Avowedis definitely undervalued, and though it will probably get pushed out of the likely nominees over the course of the year, it’s the definition of a dark horse.
Weaknesses:It would be very, very surprising for a game with a mere 80 Metascore to get nominated for Game of the Year. Surprising, but not unprecedented:Black Myth: Wukongmanaged it with an 81 Metascorelast year.
Why it could win:It might not be enough to save Ubisoft, but the whole gaming community heaved a sigh of relief when the first major Assassin’s Creed in four and a half years turned out to be good. This is AAA open-world gaming done right, with lavish production values and memorable characters.
Weaknesses:For whatever reason, the Game Awards jury is not that keen on Assassin’s Creed. 2018’sOdysseyis the only game in the series to score a Game of the Year nomination, and though it was nominated in four categories, it won none. Perhaps, like Call of Duty, the series’ heavily commercialized ubiquity is seen as a disqualifier by the judges.Shadows’ 81 Metascore is certainly too low to buck that trend.
Grant Theft Auto 6:It’s been such a long time since there was a mainline Grand Theft Auto game that The Game Awards weren’t around whenGTA 5was released. It’shard to see anything beating Rockstar’s behemoth— if, and it’s a big if, it makes its 2025 release date.
Metroid Prime 4: Beyond:Nintendo may well have multiple GOTY contenders in Switch 2’s release year, but the only one we know about for sure is Retro Studios’ very long-awaited return to the first-person sci-fi adventures of Samus.
Hades 2:Assuming it emerges from early access this year, Supergiant’s roguelike sequel will likely be leading the indie contenders for the year — out to avenge the original game’s perceived snub at the 2020 awards. (It’s eligible regardless, but the jury prefers not to nominate early access games.)
Death Stranding 2:Hideo Kojima is a Game Awards favorite and the originalDeath Strandingcontended strongly in 2019, although it ultimately lost toSekiro.Death Strandingwas divisive at the time, but in the years since, multiple rereleases have helped players get their heads around this singular vision, and with PlayStation’s full muscle behind it, the sequel is sure to make a big splash.
Ghost of Yōtei:No publisher has a better record at the Game Awards than Sony, and its other contender this year is this open-world samurai adventure — again, a sequel to a game (Ghost of Tsushima) whose reputation has only grown over time. If nothing else, this more rarefied, bespoke-feeling release will probably edge out the similarly themedAssassin’s Creed Shadows.
South of Midnight:The Game Awards jury is sure to love the culturally specific, character-forward storytelling of Compulsion Games’ occult adventure in the Deep South, which likely stands in for a delayedFable(and potentially replacesIndiana Jones) as Xbox Game Studios’ most likely contender. But its gameplay is an unknown quantity, and Compulsion’s record is a little patchy.

"Nintendo reinvents digital games as swappable, lendable Virtual Game Cards",2025-03-27T15:15:04Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/547859/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-cards,"This is a life-changing update for families of Switch users
byOli Welsh
In a surprise announcement during Thursday’s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed a major change to the way digital game purchases will be handled. From now on, digital Switch games will become Virtual Game Cards that can be swapped back and forth between consoles, and even borrowed by family members.
For players with multiple Switch consoles, Virtual Game Cards can be swapped between the systems at will. Local communication between the two systems is required, but only the first time. An internet connection is required when “ejecting” or “loading” a Virtual Game Card, but not at any other point to use the game.
Crucially, there are no restrictions on the number of accounts on a Switch that can use the Virtual Game Card. In this way, it behaves just like a physical game card — and unlike the previous digital purchases, which can be used by every account on the owner’s primary console, but only by the owner on a secondary console. They also require an internet connection to work on a secondary console.
Answering another key frustration of families of Nintendo Switch users, Virtual Game Cards can be lent to other family members whose accounts are grouped together. These loans last 14 days, after which the Virtual Game Card is automatically returned to its owner. You can only lend one game to each family member at a time.
As a member of a family with multiple Switch players, I can confirm that this is a literally life-changing update, despite the restrictions Nintendo has placed on it. I have only bought physical Switch games for years for precisely this reason, and have been unable to usefully share my digital library. No longer!
Nintendo made no mention of the Switch 2 during its Virtual Game Card announcement.

Nintendo Direct March 2025: All the news and announcements,2025-03-27T15:01:49Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/547894/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-announcements,"byMaddy Myers
The current-generation Nintendo Switch got an official send-off today in a Nintendo Direct featuring tons of announcements for the console. In a 30-minute presentation, we got to hear about a newRhythm Heavengame, a newTomodachi Life, some updates onMetroid Prime 4: BeyondandPokemon Legends: Z-A, and more.
Meanwhile, Nintendo’s Switch successor,Nintendo Switch 2, will get its own direct next week onWednesday, April 2. Expect even more game announcements and release dates then.

Nintendo’snewest Nintendo Directcomes at a strange time — less than a week before the company is set tolift the veil on Switch 2and the next generation of Nintendo software. Thursday’s Nintendo Direct was all about games coming to the original Switch, which may feel ancient in 2025, but with more than 150 million Switch consoles on the market, the console still has a massive audience that needs new games.
As Nintendo is set to move on to Switch 2, this seems like the last big Nintendo Direct for the original Switch, making the showcase something of a sendoff for the popular console. But at least two of the games Nintendo announced Thursday aren’t coming until 2026, indicating plenty of life still left in the current-gen console.

In a surprise announcement during Thursday’s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed a major change to the way digital game purchases will be handled. From now on, digital Switch games will become Virtual Game Cards that can be swapped back and forth between consoles, and even borrowed by family members.
For players with multiple Switch consoles, Virtual Game Cards can be swapped between the systems at will. Local communication between the two systems is required, but only the first time. An internet connection is required when “ejecting” or “loading” a Virtual Game Card, but not at any other point to use the game.

There are three things I love above all else: coffee shops,cozy games, andDisney. And I learned duringThursday’s Nintendo Directthat someone apparently directly probed my brain and made a game combining all three of those great loves in a new game, coming out today on Nintendo Switch, calledDisney Villains Cursed Café.
In this game, you take on the role of a potionista — that’s a barista for potions — as you work at a rundown café turned potion shop. You serve up concoctions to Disney villains, who are all rocking some slick modern AU clothes that really match up with their personalities. OfcourseGaston would be coming right from his golfing session with that little visor.

You read that right — there’s a brand-new Rhythm Heaven game,Rhythm Heaven Groove, coming to Nintendo Switch… in 2026. Nonetheless, fans are likely thrilled to have any update on any new game in a series that hasn’t had a new title since 2015 for the Nintendo 3DS.
Rhythm Heaven Groovelooks to be what it says on the tin: a head-boppin’ rhythm RPG that has players clicking to the beat to get to the next level. In true Rhythm Heaven form, the game will have tons of mini-games inside, but all of the games will test your sense of timing. You might even have to practice polyrhythms!

Nintendo has revealed a bit more aboutMetroid Prime 4: Beyond, due later this year — but made no mention of the strongly rumored possibility that there will be a Switch 2 version as well as a the planned 2025 release for the original Switch. The game’s release date remains a vague “2025.”
During Thursday’s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo showed a new trailer that revealed Samus will gain new psychic powers as she explores the jungle planet of Viewros. The powers enable Samus to manipulate magnets and doors with her mind, and even bend the trajectory of her beams.

A new Nintendo Direct showcase will be streamed live on Thursday, March 27. The new Direct will focus on games coming to the original Switch, not the upcomingNintendo Switch 2, Nintendo announced Wednesday.

Thursday’s Direct will stream live at 7 a.m. PDT/10 a.m. EDT onNintendo’s official YouTube channel. The presentation will run for around 30 minutes, Nintendo said. You can watch the new Nintendo Direct in the embedded video above.

Nintendo has revealed a bit more aboutMetroid Prime 4: Beyond, due later this year — but made no mention of the strongly rumored possibility that there will be a Switch 2 version as well as a the planned 2025 release for the original Switch. The game’s release date remains a vague “2025.”
During Thursday’s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo showed a new trailer that revealed Samus will gain new psychic powers as she explores the jungle planet of Viewros. The powers enable Samus to manipulate magnets and doors with her mind, and even bend the trajectory of her beams.
The trailer ended with the surprise reveal of an all-new look for Samus’ iconic suit: metallic red and gunmetal gray, edged with purple highlights. Is this a… psychic suit?
The trailer showed organic-looking enemies that will attack Samus as she explores the jungle, scanning stone figures and other ancient relics to make her way forward. The origin and purpose of Samus’ new psychic powers is presented as the game’s central mystery. At one point, an alien figure says to Samus, “Chosen One, we welcome you.” At another, an old spaceship is seen entangled in the vines of the jungle.
“The threads intertwining beyond space and time are beginning to weave a new tale,” said the trailer’s narrator, gnomically.
It’s still worth keeping an eye on the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct next week, on April 2, to see if a Switch 2 version ofMetroid Prime 4: Echoesmaterializes, along with a release date.

The 5 best cleaning games,2025-03-26T21:18:14Z,https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/547346/best-cleaning-video-games-cozy-house-flipper-unpacking,"From House Flipper 2 to Crime Scene Cleaner, these are the best of the best

Spring is here, and that means it’s time for spring cleaning! No, I’m not referring to my actual home, which I guess I’m also going to clean at some point, but we aren’t going to discuss that today. I am referring, of course, to the far more soothing experience of cleaning up a virtual space in a video game. There’s just nothing quite like the sensation of moving a mop icon on top of a digital dirt pile and clicking, clicking, clicking until it all disappears. If real-life mopping were that satisfying and simple, maybe I would actually do it (instead I own thisrobot mop, which isgreat, but again, that’s not why we’re here).
You might not know it, given how often I talk aboutmy love ofElden Ringorparrying inDark Souls, but cleaning games are one of my favorite video game genres — the perfect counterpoint to a tough FromSoftware title, if I may say so. Also the perfect end to a tiring real-life day! The five games on this list have seriously soothed my brain, and now I pass them on to all of you.
Where to play:PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Windows PCDespite the title,House Flipper 2(and its predecessor,House Flipper) is not so much about flipping properties for resale as it is about doing miscellaneous cleanup jobs in a small town. Beyond brief email correspondence and cellphone calls with your boss, you never really need to interact with anybody in-game; you just go to various locations and use different cleaning implements and power tools to make total shitheaps into sparkling-clean, move-in-ready living spaces. You earn digital currency as you go, so you can unlock more tools to work even faster, but take it slow — every mission is a meditative experience worth treasuring.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Windows PCThe title of this game makes it sound like you might be some sort of official crime scene cleaner for a police department, but nope. You’re playing as a civilian who needs cash badly to help his sick daughter with expensive medical treatments, and you end up working for the mob to clean up crimes. It’s lucrative, OK? Despite the grisly title and dark premise,Crime Scene Cleaneris absolutely a comedy game, with the protagonist constantly delivering sarcastic one-liners about his predicament. Plus, the crimes requiring cleanup have often unfolded in bizarre and fun locations to explore, such as a museum filled with dinosaurs’ remains… and now, human ones.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Mac, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox OneAt first,Unpackingseems like a charming little experience in which you do the titular activity that no one enjoys doing in real life but that feels strangely satisfying in this game, perhaps due to the cute interior designs and animation style on display. Over time, though, you’ll realize there’s a story here of a specific person moving from place to place and living an entire life, reflected in the things they need to unpack at each one. The result is poignant and sweet.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Mac, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XDepending on what type of brain you have,A Little to the Left’s cleaning-oriented puzzles will either leave you frustrated or extremely satisfied… or both. This game isn’t so much about clicking on messes to make them disappear; instead it’s a series of hyper-specific object-based puzzles, most of which involve simply straightening things up. Others are more like aesthetic mind games that require you to figure out an ideal orientation for a certain set of objects (should they be ordered by size, by color, by shape…?). I couldn’t always tell what each puzzle required me to do, but for most of them, it was obvious enough and gave me the nice brain buzz when I figured it out. You can skip any puzzle you get stuck on, thank goodness.
Where to play:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XThe cleaning game to beat all cleaning games,PowerWash Simulatoris also an incredible advertisement for power washers, which are actually as fun in real life as they are in this game. Real life doesn’t have the fun crossovers that this game does, though, where you get to clean up Lara Croft’s messy mansion or Shrek’s swamp. More and more DLC packs keep on getting released, soPowerWash Simis truly the gift that keeps on giving for fans of this genre.

Nintendo currently has one title on its publishing slate for Switch,Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Many third-party publishers still have Switch games coming, but the existence of a new Nintendo Direct dedicated to the original Switch certainly indicates there may be more from Nintendo itself. Nintendo is rumored to have a handful of remakes and remasters for the original Switch, but maybe there will be a surprise or two as well.

The Nintendo Switch traumatized my family and I cannot forgive it,2025-03-25T22:00:25Z,https://www.polygon.com/opinion/543105/the-nintendo-switch-traumatized-my-family-and-i-cannot-forgive-it,"﻿If I have to buy another fucking Joy-Con, I’m going to scream
byCharlie Hall
Halfway through October 2021, my youngest daughter, just 7 years old at the time, came to me with concern in her eyes. TheNintendo Switchwouldn’t turn on, and its last few moments of operation were concerning. Something about a download that had just completed, she said, and a button that said “update.” That was the end of the line for that particular unit, but only the beginning of my troubles with a console that would proceed to try my patience until this very day — an experience that makes me loath to considerbuying the Nintendo Switch 2.
The Hall family had been victim to a technical snafu as old as mobile devices themselves: the dreaded low-power firmware update. That’s when a device, like an iPhone or a graphics card or a $250 red-and-black plastic hunk of shit, loses power while it’s upgrading its most important layer of software. Firmware refers to the pieces of code that tell a device that it’s a device and not a 398-gram brick, and as I took the tripartite console from my daughter’s tiny little hands — where it was cradled like a dead bird — I knew that it was a total loss. But that wasn’t the worst part.
Inside that black mirror of despair were dozens of tiny, furry neighbors — herdigital friends fromAnimal Crossing: New Horizons. The newisland backupfeature had only recently been introduced, and her idiot father hadn’t yet taken the time to perform the arcane rites required to save a Nintendo Switch game to the cloud.
Her friends were all dead, of that I was sure. So, too, was the bell-selling knickknack shop that she and her older sister had built from scratch before showing it off on the Polygon Twitch channel. My house, my wife’s house, thosedamnable ladders and bridges that took weeks to build, and, of course, the peach trees that we all loved so much… none of them were ever coming back.
Ultimately, it’s my fault. I’m the user here, and it was my error. But I get to beangry at Nintendofor not making something like backing up hundreds of hours of irretrievable gameplay, shared joyfully during the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, just a little bit easier, or — dare I say it — a feature that gets turned on automatically from the start.
Everything about the Switch is a quirk, and some of them are more obnoxious than others
But Nintendo doesn’t treat the cloud like other console manufacturers do. It doesn’t treat online storefronts like other console manufacturers do, either. Or onboard storage. Or game cartridges. Or online multiplayer. Or friends lists. Or televisions, for that matter. Everything about the Switch is a quirk, and some of them are more obnoxious than others.
While having our original Nintendo Switch replaced by a refurbished one set me back pert near $120, I’ve easily spent at least that much buying additional controllers over the years. Both of the Joy-Cons that shipped with our original Switch suffered fromJoy-Con drift, something that my children suffered through wordlessly for months before I realized it.
“What is happening to Mario?” I asked one day while watching the girls play in the basement.
“Oh, that’s just how the controllers work now,” said my oldest. I was incredulous. There is no scenario where I would accept anything other than absolute obeisance from a human input device, but here my kids were making do, trying to complete nefarious jumping puzzles with a joystick that was barely capable of walking a virtual avatar in a straight line. Suffice it to say that they eventually lost the taste for piloting the tiny red plumber — especially when it took the better part of two months to get our controllers back after being repaired under the warranty.
When the next two broke, I just threw them away. It wasn’t even worth a trip to the post office for me.
Today we’re in a better place, thanks. The girls both have healthy relationships with video game consoles like the Xbox Series X, with iPhones and iPads, and with Windows PCs, as well as a catalog of games that each of them can call home. But they remain literally afraid of the Nintendo Switch, a console that let them down multiple times for various reasons. I can’t even coax them to bring it along for road trips.
They won’t forget that experience, and I won’t either. And that’s why I’m waving off the Nintendo Switch 2. I’ve got enough to worry about in the year of our lord 2025 that risking a visitation from another wonky portable console isn’t even on my radar.

Sunderfolk, the ambitious co-op tactical adventure game built on a love of tabletop games, is coming to consoles and PC on April 23, developer Secret Door and publisher Dreamhaven announced Tuesday. Curious players can try outSunderfolkwith a first look demo through Nvidia’s GeForce Now game-streaming service from March 25 through April 7.
Secret Door’s debut title is inspired by tabletop games likeGloomhavenand Dungeons & Dragons, and uses smart devices as a controller, à la Jackbox games.Sunderfolkis designed to be played by one to four players on a large TV screen or monitor, with the game itself running on a PC or console. Players interact with the game throughSunderfolk’s dedicated controller app, which will be free to download for Android and iOS devices.
Sunderfolk’s creators hope their game will bring players together by bypassing the complexity and setup times required for learning new tabletop games. “Our goal withSunderfolkis to leverage modern technology tomake game night something everyone can enjoy,” said Chris Sigaty, studio head of Secret Door and veteran of StarCraft and Warcraft game development.
InSunderfolk, players choose from one of six anthropomorphic heroes: an Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, or Rogue. Each character has their own strategic role and passive ability, and can be customized with weapons, armor, trinkets, and skills. Character abilities are represented by cards; players personalize their deck of skill cards as they progress through the adventure to create a well-rounded party. It is an incredibly fun and easy game to get into, and a great social experience, based on myhands-on time withSunderfolk.
Sunderfolkwill be available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Steam), and Xbox Series X on April 23. The game costs $49.99.
In addition toSunderfolk’s release date announcement, Dreamhaven and internal studio Moonshot Games also revealed a new project,Wildgate, a crew-based first-person shooter with ship combat.
Dreamhaven also announced Tuesday that it will publish competitive auto battlerMechabellum, which is currently available on Steam.

As far as what the lineup includes, there’s a sleek 27-inch 4K OLED monitor with a 240 Hz refresh rate that I have my eyes on. This display was announced atCES 2025, and should be similar to theAlienware AW2725Qthat I tested out. Even more unique is Samsung’s27-inch Odyssey 3D gaming monitor, which utilizes eye-tracking tech to make visuals appear like they’re popping out of the screen. Think of it like the top screen of the Nintendo 3DS, but with 2D-to-3D conversion tech that’s significantly more advanced. Only games supported by Samsung’s Reality Hub app will work in 3D, and it won’t display DRM content in 3D. Also, it’ll only work with Nvidia graphics cards.
Prices and release dates for these monitors haven’t been shared yet.

The 10 games that defined the Nintendo Switch,2025-03-24T20:55:02Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/545093/nintendo-switch-most-important-games,"The console’s key games tell the story of a changing Nintendo
byOli WelshandMichael McWhertor
What games do you think of when you think of Nintendo’s Switch? There are several obvious answers; Nintendo’s in-house studios never fail to leave their mark on a system with a handful of brilliant games. Yet one of the most notable things about the Switch, as it prepares to cede the limelight toSwitch 2after eight years on the market, is that it has been less software-dependent than, perhaps, any Nintendo console since the NES.
Of course the Switch wouldn’t be the success it has been without its biggest games. In its first year,The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandMario Kart 8 Deluxehelped the console find a massive audience. Yet both started as games for Wii U, Nintendo’sleastsuccessful platform. The Switch really was a case of a console that carved out a space for itself by arriving with the right form factor at the right time. The games that worked well on it found a console that was uniquely capable of adapting itself to suit them and helping them find players, rather than the other way around.
The Switch began a new era for Nintendo as a platform holder that began to look a little more like the others, even if it continued to play by its own rules. The games that defined the console aren’t necessarilythe bestor the biggest. Shockingly, they don’t include a mainline Mario platform game. They’re the games that described what the Switch meant to players, and how it changed Nintendo — and the rest of the game industry.
Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ unprecedented success on Switch was a mixed blessing. It was in no small part a blockbuster hit due to the devastating worldwide pandemic that forced us indoors and into isolation around its release.New Horizonsgave many of its players a taste of connection and community when they couldn’t physically meet up with friends, family, and colleagues.
ButNew Horizonswas more than just a digital alternative to real-world socializing. It was a place where we made new virtual friends, found comfort in routine, and exercised control over our lives, albeit imaginary ones lived on our own private islands. The coziness of Animal Crossing was a refuge during a difficult stretch.
That’s not to say thatNew Horizonswasn’t an enjoyable evolution of the Animal Crossing experience on its own merits. It was. There was joy to be found in building and customizing a home — and even in paying it off — and exploiting the game’s quirks to amass riches. Millions of us delighted in daily interactions with Isabelle, Blathers, and the Nook boys, and waited with anticipation as new villagers visited our town, praying that we’d pull a “dreamy.” It was a brief taste of video game monoculture, fueled by the state of the world, and a defining moment in the Switch’s success. —Michael McWhertor
Breath of the Wildhas become so inextricably linked with the Switch that it’s easy to forget it was also released on Wii U, and in fact was announced as a Wii U game before we even knew what the Switch was. Nintendo’s decision to pivot it to a cross-gen release gifted the Switch what might be the greatest launch title of all time.
Beyond that, it marked a creative turning point for Nintendo as a game developer, and sent a clear message that the Switch was ushering in a new era for the company. The game’s bold, nonlinear, systemic design was a huge departure for the Zelda series, synthesizing many influences from beyond Nintendo’s Miyamoto-worshipping bubble into something that was distinctive and original, but also felt like it had been made in a world whereSkyrimandMinecrafthad happened. The sequel,Tears of the Kingdom, took things even further by giving players an astonishing, almost game-breaking level of creative freedom.
Breath of the Wildturned one of Nintendo’s oldest franchises into its most modern. It also outsold every mainline Mario game on the Switch, a first for the Zelda series. It was quite clear that Nintendo would never be the same again. —Oli Welsh
Switch was a platform for second chances. Many of Nintendo’s games that failed to break through on the poorly selling Wii U found new life on Switch, including the Splatoon franchise,Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, andCaptain Toad: Treasure Tracker. But none of those ports and rereleases have enjoyed the incredible success ofMario Kart 8 Deluxe, a souped-up version of the 2014 kart racer that has since gone on to outsell its predecessor eight times over.
Mario Kart 8 DeluxeistheSwitch game; two out of every five Switch owners have a copy. It was so successful for Nintendo that, five years afterDeluxelaunched, the company released 48 more courses and eight additional characters as DLC. In an equally important move, Nintendo included that DLC as part of its Nintendo Switch Online subscription, part of the company’s plan to offer more than just multiplayer connectivity and classic games.
It’s telling that the first game Nintendo has shown for Switch 2 is a new Mario Kart.Deluxenot only brought in all-new fans of the Mario Kart franchise, it helped get the storied franchise back on, ahem, track. —MM
Let’s be honest; the Switch is not the ideal platform to playThe Witcher 3. Nintendo’s console is manifestly underpowered for a game that was cutting-edge in 2015 and remained a technical showpiece when Nintendo’s console launched two years later. At the time, Nintendo was also not a natural home for such bloody, sexy, world-weary fare.
This is precisely why the Switch port ofThe Witcher 3is so important. It’s significant that anyone tried to make it, and incredible thatthey pulled it off. Nintendo had long left the world of AAA gaming behind, and even during the success of the Wii, big publishers tended not to bring their marquee titles over because they were too technically demanding or aimed at a perceived different market. When the Wii U flopped, many third parties deserted Nintendo altogether.
The Switch, however, was not just a huge sales success — with its appealing form factor and the undeniableBreath of the Wild, it had thrust Nintendo back into the hearts of the core gaming community. All of a sudden, third parties were clamoring to be part of it, and a few studios began to specialize in cramming AAA titles onto Switch’s aging mobile chipset and into the tight confines of its game cards. A wave of “miracle” ports began with2016’sDoom, and of these, the 2019 port ofThe Witcher 3was the white whale. Not long after, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X widened the technical gulf again to a point where the ports would start to dry up — but you can expect the floodgates to reopen on Switch 2. —OW
“Everyone is here!” Nintendo promised withSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate. The game maker not only kept that promise, it overdelivered with one of the most impressive expansions to any Nintendo franchise ever. In addition to stacking the game’s core roster with 69 playable characters, including every fighter who’d ever appeared in a Smash Bros. game and surprising newcomers like Castlevania’s Simon and Metroid’s Ridley, the game’s developers pulled off what felt like impossible licensing deals. Banjo and Kazooie. Kingdom Hearts’ Sora.Final Fantasy 7’s Sephiroth.Minecraft’s Steve and Alex.
The massive growth of the Switch and the fervor for more Super Smash Bros. seemed to feed off of each other. Led by tireless game makerMasahiro Sakurai, the yearslong development ofSuper Smash Bros. Ultimateresulted in the series’ biggest entry yet, so gargantuan that one has to question if Nintendo and Sakurai can ever top it.
And whileSuper Smash Bros. Ultimatewas a major step forward for the franchise,Nintendo’s approach to esportsand its games being featured at non-Nintendo-sanctioned events hasn’t evolved much during the Switch era. —MM
Who would have seen Labo coming? Nintendo’s DIY “build-and-play” line of accessories let Switch owners craft cardboard “Toy-Con” versions of real-world items like a 13-key piano, fishing rod, and motorbike — and evena VR headset— for an all-new play experience that evoked the wild accessories released during the Wii era.
In retrospect, it’s almost shocking that Nintendo Labo arrived just 13 months after the release of the Switch. What now feels like a late-life cycle attempt to reinvigorate the Switch with a gimmick was just another moment of unexpected innovation from Nintendo.
While interest in Labo died out fairly quickly (building the Toy-Cons was 90% of the fun), it was a reminder of the uniqueness and adaptability of the Switch Joy-Cons to act as more than just conveniently detachable controllers — an idea that Nintendo would later explore with the similarly creative and unexpectedRing Fit Adventure. —MM
It might seem strange to chooseScarletandVioletto represent Pokémon on this list. Of the Switch’s mainline Pokémon titles,SwordandShieldwere better received by fans and even sold better (by a hair’s breadth). But it’s precisely because of theirperformance woesanduninspired designthatScarletandVioletare, sadly, more symptomatic of the Switch era.
The runaway success of the Switch always represented a risk that Nintendo might rush too keenly to capitalize, letting its famous quality control standards slip in the process. As far as its internal studios were concerned, iron discipline was maintained, but Nintendo didn’t have as much success in keeping its partners at The Pokémon Company and developer Game Freak in check.
The Switch saw 12 Pokémon games released in six years, including four (soon to be five) major Game Freak titles; the developer releasedScarletandVioletand the superiorPokémon Legends: Arceusin thesame year. It was just too much, andScarletandVioletbore the signs of an exhausted studio trapped in a content grind. You really can have too much of a good thing. —OW
Pairing the greatest video game of all time with the hot genre of the moment forTetris 99felt both like a uniquely classic Nintendo move and surprisingly forward-thinking for the company. While other game makers chased variations on the battle royale shooter, Nintendo and developer Arika took a different approach, resulting in a frenetically fun, all-ages take on what is traditionally a violent genre.
Shadow-dropped as a bonus perk for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in 2019, the release ofTetris 99brought fresh buzz to the Switch. Its success spawned even more variations on the battle royale formula from Nintendo, withSuper Mario Bros. 35andF-Zero 99. (Arika also created a99-player battle royale version of Pac-Manfor Bandai Namco.)
Tetris 99’s most lasting impact, however, may be its role as a value add for NSO subscribers. Nintendo, having already mined most of its back catalog from the NES and SNES era forNintendo Switch Online’s classic games offerings, will need more games likeTetris 99to keep Switch 2 owners interested and subscribed to the service. —MM
The Switch era has run parallel with a surge in interest in Japanese-made RPGs, and it’s very much not a coincidence. Japanese publishers and developers naturally flooded to the console, which had huge sales in their home market, at the same time as the overseasanime boomcreated just the right cultural environment for these games to have an international moment. Nintendo saw the opportunity and lent a hand, often shining a light on Japanese-made games in its Direct broadcasts, and occasionally stepping in to co-publish games like Square Enix’s gorgeous throwbackOctopath Traveler.
Nintendo was well placed to benefit from this snowball effect with some of its own games, including the Xenoblade Chronicles series. But the ultimate example was 2019’sFire Emblem: Three Houses. Intelligent Systems’ tactical RPG series had always been beloved within its specific niche, but the audience the Switch had amassed for anime-flavored RPGs turned it into something bigger — a sort of viral hit, powered by players’ obsession over the game’s characters and relationships and its Harry Potter-style system of rival school houses.Three Housesshowed how the Switch was, and remains, one of the most fandom-friendly platforms around. —OW
While major third parties took a little longer to turn their oil tankers in Nintendo’s direction, the indie developer scene saw the potential of Nintendo’s machine almost instantly and rushed to take advantage. For several years, it was common for indies to release their hits on Steam and Switch first, and worry about PlayStation and Xbox later. The Switch’s humble tech was no barrier to these games, and the immediacy of their designs often suited portable play perfectly.
The two games that most symbolize the Switch’s indie era are 2018’sHollow Knightand 2020’sHades— both fantastically refined action games in popular genres that are tricky to get right (Metroidvania and roguelike, respectively). Both found huge audiences, thanks in part to the Switch’s enormous reach. Of the two, it’s probably Team Cherry’sHollow Knightthat is more closely associated with the Switch — if only because its long, long-awaited sequelSilksongwas first announced at a Nintendo Direct, and the increasingly desperate anticipation of new info about the game ahead of every Direct since has become a meme. —OW

A Nintendo game trend that looks like it will continue on Switch 2,2025-03-22T15:15:36Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/544241/nintendo-switch-2-multiplayer-mmo,"Nintendo’s been flirting with big multiplayer numbers this generation

Former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata passed before the Switch launched in 2017, but he left the company with a vision that it’s beginning to make good on — one that will be crucial to the Switch 2.
“Mr. Iwata was the head of development, so he put a lot of thought and time into Switch,” veteran game designer and Nintendo fellow Shigeru Miyamoto toldTimein 2017. “[T]he idea of Nintendo Switch being a device you can take out and anywhere, and the idea of it being a system that really allows networking and communicating with people, I think that’s something Mr. Iwata put a lot of emphasis on.”
The originalSwitch was pitched partly on the idea of bringing people together to play, with locally played games like1-2-SwitchandSnipperclips. But Nintendo clearly has bigger multiplayer ambitions, as some of its recent game output shows.
Despite its creativity and innovation, Nintendo can often seem behind the curve when adopting new technologies or game ideas. Nintendo abandoned the technological console arms race in 2006 with the launch of the underpowered Wii, proving it doesn’t need to win on graphics. The company instead prefers to follow the “Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology” philosophy — creating new ideas using mature, reliable technology — that Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi described in his bookGunpei Yokoi Game Kan.
Nintendo has also been notoriously slower than its competitors in adopting online multiplayer features in its games, sometimes relying on clunky solutions like Friend Codes and theNintendo Switch Online smartphone appto bring players together. Meeting up with friends inAnimal Crossing: New Horizonswas a notoriouslypainful process.
But Nintendo has been keeping pace with a multiplayer trend during the Switch era, experimenting with ever larger numbers of players.Tetris 99,F-Zero 99, andSuper Mario Bros. 35— these competitive multiplayer games borrowed from popular last-player-standing games (PUBG,Fortnite) to modernize classic 8- and 16-bit franchises with huge player counts.
Nintendo likewise bumped up player counts in party gameSuper Mario Party Jamboree, which featureda 20-player mode called Koopathlon, andEverybody 1-2-Switch!which let up to 100 players get into the action through smartphone support. Even a flagship game likeSuper Mario Bros. Wondersupported online lobbies for up to 12 players (andborrowed some smart multiplayer ideasfrom the Dark Souls franchise).
We’re already seeing some of that in thenew Mario Kart game for Switch 2, which looks like it will double the number of simultaneous online competitors seen in previous Mario Kart entries from 12 to 24.
Some of these massively multiplayer games have arrived near the end of the Switch’s life cycle, suggesting that Nintendo is getting started with its massively multiplayer ambitions.
Last year, the company started theNintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program, a mysterious beta that Nintendo developed to “test the boundaries of mass multiplayer functionality and gameplay on our servers.” How Nintendo will implement its MMO-like ideas remains to be seen, but there are certainly strong Nintendo franchise candidates that could benefit from introducing higher player counts.
Bringing even bigger audiences together to experience the joy of play through Nintendo IP like Super Mario Bros. and Animal Crossing — as well as brand-new experiences — could be the culmination of Iwata’s vision.

How a Mega Man fan project got an official Capcom license,2025-03-21T21:39:03Z,https://www.polygon.com/q-and-a/539004/mega-man-hand-drawn-guide-interview,"It’s been a wild ride for Hand-Drawn Game Guides

It’s been a wild ride for Hand-Drawn Game Guides
byMatt Leone
Back in 2021, Philip Summers launcheda Kickstarter campaignfor Hand-Drawn Game Guides, a series of books that resembled traditional strategy guides, apart from the fact that they were all illustrated by Summers. The campaign was a hit, generating over $300,000 in pledges, but like a number of fan projects utilizing game company IPs, it was pulled before the countdown ended.
He ended up changing plans due to legal concerns, going on to work on other projects and releasing the planned guides from the campaignas free downloads. From the outside, that seemed like the new path for Hand-Drawn Game Guides.
But then, in January 2025, Summers returned to Kickstarter with a surprise announcement — he’d struck a deal with Capcom to make an officially licensed entry in the series:Hand-Drawn Game Guides: Mega Man. That campaign was also a success, and Summers is now working on the book and intending to release it later this year.
In an effort to spotlight game-related books and documentaries, Polygon is running an email interview series with the people behind them. We previously connected with Julian Rignall about his not-quite-an-autobiographyThe Games of a Lifetime, Paul Vogel about his Housemarque documentaryThe Name of the Game, Lewis Packwood about his obscure game hardware bookCurious Video Game Machines, and Oliver Harper about hisStreet Fighter 2documentaryHere Comes a New Challenger. Below, Summers discusses how the Mega Man project came about and where he wants to take Hand-Drawn Game Guides in the future.
Polygon: When you launched the Kickstarter campaign, a lot of people were surprised that the book was licensed by Capcom. How did that come about behind the scenes?
Philip Summers:Lucas Thomas from Nintendo Force Magazine/NF Publishing was a fan of the original Hand-Drawn Game Guides campaign and basically remembered me all these years later! He has been expanding into book publishing and wanted to work on a property officially. With some work he was able to get the license from Capcom to create Mega Man books and asked if I would be willing to resurrect the Hand-Drawn Game Guides concept and do it legit this time. We still needed to pitch the book to them for approval, so we created a sequence of pages to present. They liked what they saw and we were able to move ahead from there.
There’s a long history of game books running into legal issues with copyright holders. Do you have any advice for others looking to do similar projects?
Unfortunately I don’t have any real advice on how to go about jumping through some of these loopholes. In the years since my original campaign shut down, I’ve come to find that different companies respond to different types of projects and they all have their own reasons. What I can tell you is that if you plan on launching something like a Kickstarter where your funding totals are public and the project heavily features IP that you don’t have the rights to, it’s highly likely it will get shut down.
In the Mega Man Kickstarter campaign, you mentioned the possibility of doing more Mega Man books after this one. What’s the status of that?
At this point it’s too early to tell. I think we’ll have a much better understanding of where we stand once the book is completed and shipped. Assuming people are happy with it, and Capcom is happy with it, I think it’s fair to say we’ll be able to move onto the next one, which the obvious choice isMega Man 2. Though I really loveMega Man Xtoo!
Long-term, what are your plans for Hand-Drawn Game Guides? Is the idea to get official licenses for other games and make this a regular thing?
For sure! I have a whole list of games I’d love to work on, and if we end up putting out a great product we’re hopeful more companies will be receptive to letting us give one of their classic games the Hand-Drawn Game Guides treatment. This is a side gig for me, so I can only work so quickly, but who knows maybe that could change one day too.

You are Phil Spencer. Which Ubisoft IP do you buy?,2025-03-21T21:29:31Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/544628/ubisoft-ip-sale-microsoft-phil-spencer-not-assassins-creed,"Just a little one. As a treat
byOli Welsh
According toone very annoyed Ubisoft investor, citing a private report by investor service Mergermarket, Ubisoft has been holding secret talks with Microsoft, Electronic Arts, and other publishers who are interested in acquiring some of the troubled publisher’s franchises.
This is interesting in the context of Ubisoft’s current struggles; the floundering publisher hasn’t had a hit in a while, is losing the confidence of investors, and is “exploring strategic options” that include going private and breaking up the company. Thelatest reportssuggest Ubisoft is looking to create a new entity that will hold on to some core intellectual property. Things are so bad that even a stellar launch forAssassin’s Creed Shadowswon’t necessarily fix it all.
It’s also an interesting prompt for assessing the Ubisoft catalog. What properties does Ubisoft have that are worth buying, but that Ubisoft itself can do without? What can Ubisoft sell without throwing its soul into the bargain?
So, I propose a little thought exercise. You are Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming. You have spent many billions acquiring publishers like Bethesda and Activision Blizzard, and studios like Obsidian and Double Fine, in a seeming attempt to own all of gaming (if not to actually sell Xbox consoles). But you are not quite satiated yet, and the spectacle of a floundering French publisher conducting a yard sale of storied franchises is too tempting to resist. Maybe just a little one? As a treat?
What will you choose? For the purposes of this exercise, we’ll assume that Assassin’s Creed is not for sale; it’s Ubisoft’s flagship, and without it the publisher might as well just close up shop. To a lesser extent, the same goes for Far Cry. And we’ll also assume that all the Tom Clancy games are off the table. It’s true that some parts of the Clancyverse seem ripe for the picking — for example, Splinter Cell, a fondly remembered stealth action series (with strong links to Xbox) that Ubisoft is currently doing nothing with. But it seems unlikely that the Clancy estate would be interested in breaking these properties up — and there’s no way Ubisoft is letting go of Rainbow Six, which is one of its most reliable cash cows.
So, what’s left in the shop window to tempt a browsing Microsoft exec?
Well now. This one is quite tempting, isn’t it? A largely dormant action-adventure franchise, recently revived by a quality Metroidvania, but with a major reboot wallowing in development hell. You never really had anything to match Uncharted with. This could be it, maybe… although corporate might not like the optics of an American giant swooping in to acquire the most famous Middle Eastern gaming icon. Especially in… the current climate.
You never really had a platforming mascot to speak of, but this one is just soprofoundlyFrench it’s impossible to imagine it as a standard-bearer for the greenest, most American game console. Respectfully, it’s a hard pass.
The same ought to apply to Ubisoft’s funny little rabbit guys, but if you squint, they look an awful lot like Minions. And Minions arehugewith kids. Family franchises are a bit of a blind spot for Xbox. On the other hand, the only decent games the Rabbids have ever been in also starred Mario, and Furukawa-san over at Nintendo probably won’t be into it. (You need to call him, though, about putting every single one of your franchises on Switch 2 — it never hurts to ask!)
This is a multiplayer game you’ve never heard of about medieval warriors beating each other up. But there’s a note on the sticker that Ubisoft reckons it has35 million players? That can’t be right. Have your team pull the data on that one. Might be worth it, if it’s cheap. Who doesn’t like swords?
You actuallydohave Forza Horizon at home. So it’s a pass.
Oh man, you remember loving the original one on PlayStation. And didn’t they do that wacky one that was all about a ghost policeman possessing cars? That was cool. You have enough driving games, but this one’s a little bit different, a bit funky. Ask if they’ll throw it in with something else.
[You have a Kinect trauma flashback and curl up in a ball on the floor.]
You didn’t spend $7.5 billion acquiring The Elder Scrolls for nothing. Except, apparently you did, because the next one is never coming out, and Obsidian could probably churn out three Might and Magic games for you by next week. Still though… nah.
Somehow, despite buying half the game industry, you don’t really have any GTA-style open-world games, and to Ubi’s credit, Watch Dogs got quite good; you remember thinking the last one,Legion, was pretty fun. If theyreallywon’t let you have Assassin’s Creed (note to self: up offer by $0.5-1 billion), you could see yourself owning this. But then… it’s not actually GTA or Assassin’s Creed, is it? It’s not even Far Cry.
Nowyou’re talking. A franchise that was maybe never actually popular, but that has ascended into fanboy myth status. A directionless vaporware project that’s been stuck in development hell for somewhere between 10 and 20 years. But you couldsaveit, Phil. Think of the gamer cred! Think how cool your T-shirt reveal would be! It’s just so Xbox. It’s just soyou. Where’s Satya’s company card?

Xenoblade Chronicles X might run at 60 fps on Switch 2,2025-03-21T17:17:42Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/544485/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-60-fps-switch-2,"An unused 60 fps mode raises a lot of questions
byIan Walker
A programmer poking around the newly releasedXenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Editionon Switch has discovered references toan unused 60 fps modein the game’s code, fueling speculation of a potential upgrade on Switch 2 when Nintendo’s next console rolls around later this year.
Switch modder MasaGratoR shared a screenshot of theXenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Editioncode to X on March 19. Henotedthat this 60 fps mode is “implemented only partially” because it “causes weird issues” when activated.
“Gameplay is rendered every second frame, so even though it outputs 60 FPS you get in fact 30 usable frames,” MasaGratoRaddedwhen asked about the issues presented by the higher framerate. “Cutscenes sometimes are working fine, sometimes some objects are jittering like hardcoded to be 30 FPS, sometimes it’s again every second frame rendered.”
While it’s entirely possible this code is just leftover evidence of the developers at Monolith Soft trying to get 60 fps working on the original Switch, the Switch 2 specssuggested by leaksshould be more than enough to handle such a framerate boost. Nintendo has yet to say whether or not backwards-compatible Switch games will be upgraded on Switch 2.
Xenoblade Chronicles Xfirst launched on Wii U in 2015, somehow cramming a massive, roleplaying adventure into a tiny space andgarnering praiseas one of the best games on the doomed console.Definitive Edition, available on Switch since March 20, features improved visuals and new story content.

Future Games Show trailer reopens the story of banger horror comic I Hate This Place,2025-03-21T17:13:36Z,https://www.polygon.com/trailer/544255/i-hate-this-place-horror-game-comic-adaptation,"Its original title was ‘F*ck This Place’
bySusana Polo
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
I Hate This Place, the 2022 horror series from writer Kyle Starks and artist Artyom Toplin, wasone of my favorite comicsthat year. And now, as revealed in the Future Games Show, it’s a neon-colored isometric open-world survival horror game that I’ll probably be too chicken to play.
I Hate This Place— originally announced asFuck This Place, which is a way better title, but, like, I get it — starred Gabby and Trudy, a lesbian couple who see the cattle ranch they just inherited as their ticket to financial stability. Unfortunately, the family ranch is secretly a locus for every horror genre simultaneously: hauntings, alien abductions, a Strange Entity in the Forest, Secret Knife Killer Hiding Among You, the Place Won’t Let You Leave, Survivalist Cult Apocalypse, and so on.I Hate This Placewas kind of like… “Fast Car” meetsThe Cabin in the Woods.
The new game adaptation is being developed by Bloober Team (2019’sBlair Witch,The Medium), under the company’s new horror imprint Broken Mirror Games, and appears to focus on an original story set in the comic’s titular Place, potentially a prequel. “Players take on the role of Elena, whose fight for survival begins when she unwittingly awakens a malevolent force,” says a joint news release from Bloober Team andI Hate This Place(the comic)’s Skybound Entertainment. The game will feature “retro ‘80s comic book aesthetics,” where the original comic was set in the modern day.
“Each location is lovingly crafted to tell its own disturbing story through stylish visuals that blur the line between reality and nightmare in a world where everything wants you dead.” According to the news release, gameplay will feature “tense gunfights and melee combat that rewards ingenuity over brute force, all while crafting essential tools to survive the harsh and unforgiving wilderness long enough to reach safehouses before nightfall, with the day & night cycle having an impact on gameplay dynamics.”
I Hate This Placeis currently set to launch in Q4 of 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch. It’s available to wishlist onSteamand theEpic Games Store, and you could pick up the comic that inspired it onAmazon,Bookshop, or at your local store.

Nightdive Studios announces launch date for System Shock 2 remake,2025-03-20T21:05:29Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/543748/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-edition-launch-release-date-nightdive-studios,"The System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Edition comes to PC and consoles June 26
byAlice Jovanée
System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Edition(formerly titledSystem Shock 2: Enhanced Edition) will be arriving on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch on June 26, courtesy of Nightdive Studios. Announced at the Future Game Show Spring Showcase, the25th Anniversary Editionbrings a fresh coat of paint to the classic 1999 sci-fi horror game and will be the first classic System Shock title playable on consoles.
This effort isn’t nearly as extensive as the excellentSystem Shockfrom 2023, butSystem Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Editionstill features a massive graphics overhaul with updated textures and ultrawide support, in addition to new audio recordings and a litany of quality-of-life improvements to make the game more palatable for modern audiences. Nightdive took a similar approach to its Enhanced Edition of the originalSystem Shock, turning the previously obtuse title into what many consider the ideal way to play the 1994 game.
Over the past 25 years,System Shock 2has received aremarkable amount of community supportin the form of patches, higher-resolution textures, and other fixes. These mods offer an excellent version ofSystem Shock 2, but the process of getting everything running properly makes the experience relatively hostile to new players. The25th Anniversary Editionintegrates many of these improvements while optimizing aspects ofSystem Shock 2that haven’t been touched since 1999.System Shock 2is one of my favorite games of all time, and I’m excited for a new generation of players to experience the maiden voyage of the Von Braun when the game comes out in June.

"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is 5. So, uh… when’s the next?",2025-03-20T17:26:19Z,https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing/543546/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-five-today-whens-the-next-one-speculation,"New Switch, new Animal Crossing?
byNicole Carpenter
It’s been exactly five years since Nintendo releasedAnimal Crossing: New Horizons,the best-selling Animal Crossing game in Nintendo’s history. In fact, it’s one of the Nintendo Switch’smost popular games ever, too, having sold nearly 48 million copies. It’s no wonder that people are already thinking about what’s next for the franchise, especially given the upcoming release ofNintendo’s next generation console.
Nintendo hasn’t said a thing about the future of the franchise,aside from the closure ofAnimal Crossing: Pocket Campand the release of itsAnimal Crossing: Pocket Camp Completeversion.New Horizonshasn’t gotten amajor update since 2021 and theHappy Home ParadiseDLC and its subsequent free update. Events continue, andsmaller updates were released later, but otherwise, there’s been little or no new content to show.
We can look back to Nintendo’s release schedule for the franchise for guidance. The firstAnimal Crossingwas released in 2001, followed up byAnimal Crossing: Wild Worldin 2005 — a five year gap.Animal Crossing: City Folkcame later, in 2008. AfterCity Folk,Animal Crossing: New Leafwas released in 2012 — again, five years.New LeafandNew Horizonshave the biggest gap of 8 years, from 2012 to 2020 whenNew Horizonswas released. Notably,New Horizonsdebuted several years into the Nintendo Switch’s lifespan. It makes sense that timing between games would increase as technology becomes more complex and games become bigger, but I think it’s unlikely we’ll see a gap that big betweenNew Horizonsand whatever is next.
Nintendo has its Switch 2 presentation set for April 2, and early Animal Crossing fans are hoping there’s a mention of Animal Crossing at the event. I would be surprised; the focus of the event is the console itself — and a new Animal Crossing game would likely overshadow so much of it all. If anything, maybe a small teaser with Tom Nook wondering about his next business venture.

Nintendo’s Switch 2 marketing blitz includes a big deal with MLB,2025-03-20T14:25:52Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/543331/nintendo-switch-2-mlb-seattle-mariners,"A Switch 2 sports announcement
byMichael McWhertor
Get ready to see a lot of Nintendo logos this summer, especially if you’re a fan of Major League Baseball. The Seattle Mariners announced Thursday that they’ve partnered with Nintendo as the team’s “first-ever official jersey sleeve partner.” That means that the Nintendo logo and theNintendo Switch 2logo will be featured on Mariners players’ sleeves, starting March 27.
Nintendo’s “racetrack” logo will appear on Mariners’ home jerseys, while the (much beefier) Switch 2 logo will appear on the team’s away jerseys. According to the Mariners, that will make the Seattle-based team the first in the MLB to feature different marks for home and away games.
“Nintendo and the Mariners have been inextricably linked since 1992,” Seattle Mariners president of business operations Kevin Martinez said in a statement. Martinez is referring to when Redmond, Wash.-based Nintendo of America purchased the Mariners in the early ’90s. (Nintendo sold its stake in the team in 2016.) “Now, each time the Mariners take the field, our jersey sleeves will help serve as a reminder of all that Nintendo of America has done for the Northwest community and the team.”
Logos of video game companies appearing on U.S.-based sports teams is incredibly rare. While gaming brands are commonplace in sports racing circles andin European football leagues, Seattle is something of an exception. Another local team, Seattle Sounders FC, featured an Xbox logo on its jerseys from 2009 to 2016.
Advertisements on MLB jerseys were all-but forbidden before before 2022. The league’s 2022-2027 collective bargaining agreement allows for a small shoulder patch with a corporate logo or image on one sleeve of players’ uniforms and batting helmets.
You can see the Seattle Mariners’ new Nintendo branding next week, when the team hosts the Athletics on opening day.
Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to launch sometime this summer. More details will be revealed in aNintendo Direct dedicated on Switch 2on April 2.

The GDC Awards’ 2025 Game of the Year winners are rolling in,2025-03-20T02:01:38Z,https://www.polygon.com/events/542599/gdc-awards-2025-winners-igf,"The influential industry event names its GOTY picks
byMatt Patches
While the scale of December’s The Game Awards has given the trailer-heavy show the glow of the gaming industry’s Oscar equivalent, the annual Game Developers Choice Awards and Independent Game Festival Awards, held together each year at GDC, are closer to an Academy Awards-like event. Voted on by artists and craftspeople who make games, the GDC Awards represent a different perspective on “Game of the Year” — even if the winners often align with the TGAs.
On Wednesday, devs from around the world congregated at the GDC main stage in San Francisco to celebrate the full swatch of 2024 games, from indie to AAA. Here are the categories for both the GDC Awards and IGF Awards, the full slates of nominees, and winners (in bold).
