Blue Prince is a mystery-packed mansion that will crank open your mind,2025-04-04T22:17:07Z,https://www.polygon.com/review/553730/blue-prince-review-pc,"No two rooms at Mt. Holly are the same — nor do they even stay in the same place
byJay Castello
The house at Mt. Holly has 45 rooms. But the placement of each of those rooms is up to you — and it resets every day. You’ve been left the house and its estate as an inheritance, but only if you can find the mysterious 46throom.
In this way,Blue Princeblends its puzzles with both deck-building and roguelite elements. When you open the entrance hall door at the start of every morning, you’ll be given a choice of three rooms that might lie beyond it. Each of them has a fixed number and orientation of doors, limiting your path through the house, and each room has its own small bonus — or, in some cases, a drawback.
You might, for instance, draw the bedroom, and get rewarded with 10 additional steps to use throughout the day. Or you might draw the weight room, and lose half of your carefully scrounged footsteps. (The game’s step counter is a limitation on your movement; you can’t walk forever through the house, and if you run out of steps, you’ll have to come back the next day and start from scratch.) Or you might draw the parlor and have to solve a truth-and-lie logic puzzle to get gems, which you can spend on drafting more useful rooms later. Or you might find the nook, which always has a key; keys become increasingly necessary as you progress, since doors become more likely to be locked.
And then, packed in everywhere and anywhere, there’s the intrigue. In one early run, I opened a chest to find the “Key to the Secret Garden,” which warned me that it would not be an easy room to locate. It wasn’t until much later that I got access to the orchard, which explained how and where I could get access to said garden. But then I had to wait to run into the key again. That wait could have been a drag, except that (at least in the game’s first 10 or so hours) I was juggling dozens of these small cause-and-effect bits of progress at once, so there was always something to make me feel like I was moving forward.
This gradual accumulation of knowledge is almost the whole ofBlue Prince(one early room recommends having a notebook at hand; I filled several pages), although there are some architectural elements of the house that become permanent, making future runs more likely to be fruitful. These moments tend to feel big, some of them even having very atmospheric cutscenes that break up the routine of drafting door after door. You’ll also be collecting passwords and codes that stay the same across runs. Mainly, every new draft is a question of what you will learn about the estate and how you will apply that knowledge in future runs.
Spending run after run in the house gives you a lot of time to appreciate just how finely it’s built. Every room has a different walking sound to reflect the kind of flooring it has, for example. There are moments when the creeping dread of being alone in a shape-shifting house suddenly cuts through, momentarily but completely changing the atmosphere. And there are dozens of architectural details and notes and bits of clutter that all go into building up an idea of the history that once went on between these old walls.
With so many details hidden in every room, though, it’s important to bear in mind that the house also holds many, many mysteries that go much beyond your inheritance. After a while, discoveries that didn’t lead to something useful for the specific goal of finding the 46th room sometimes started to feel like disappointments, until I rolled around to the other side and started to appreciate just how much more is going on in this mysterious mansion. Being open to these grander puzzles, and accepting that solving one big question is only a sliver of what the game has to offer, made it much less frustrating.
Having said that, that willingness to be open is sometimes difficult to maintain when you run into a string of bad luck. Unless you are enlightenment-levels of willing to accept everything the game has to throw at you, sometimes you really will want to do a few runs just looking for something specific, which is never guaranteed. And unfortunately, the first several minutes of every attempt do end up feeling very samey, as the game doesn’t usually start offering more interesting rooms until you’re some way into the house. Some rooms are also just straight-up annoying. There’s a math-based puzzle that I hated every time, and it becomes harder and harder as you do more and more runs — but it’s very punishing to skip it because it grants keys, which are extremely valuable.
Because of friction like this, I think thatBlue Princeis going to live on the strength of its community. There came a point where repeating runs was not getting me anywhere, and every time, I would dread having to spend 10 or so minutes going through the motions again before getting a chance of seeing something new. (Or at least, something new that was going to make me feel like I was actually progressing toward a goal that I was interested in.) It turned out that I had missed something I could interact with in a room that I had previously written off as useless, which I only found out by talking to other people who were playing. Figuring that out had me rolling credits within a couple of hours — and more importantly, those couple of hours completely recaptured the enthusiasm and sense of discovery I’d had in the early game.
Seeding those kinds of hints without spoilers isn’t easy, but I do expectBlue Princeto grow the kind of fan base that can pull it off. It’s good now, but that will make it even better.
Blue Princewill be released April 10 on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. The game was reviewed on PC using a prerelease download code provided by Raw Fury.

Are PC handhelds like Steam Deck really competitors for Switch 2?,2025-04-04T21:19:21Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553131/pc-handhelds-steam-deck-vs-switch-2,"They compete closely on price and specs, but Nintendo still owns the mass market
byOli Welsh
When Nintendo launched the Switch in 2017, it had no competition in dedicated handheld gaming, a sector it had established with the Game Boy in 1989 and ruled ever since. Sega had come and gone; Sony, after two determined attempts with the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita, had just about given up.
As Switch 2 nears launch in 2025, things look a little different — but only a little. The colossal success of the Switch has awoken the slumbering giants. Sony and Microsoft are now reportedly preparingdedicated PlayStationandXbox handhelds. Improbably, though, it was the PC gaming sphere that made the first move. Valve led the way with the Steam Deck in 2022, which swiftly seeded a growing ecosystem of similar, PC-based handheld devices from manufacturers like Lenovo and Asus. After a quiet decade, non-Nintendo handheld gaming is a thing again. And that means the Switch 2 will not run unopposed for handheld gaming supremacy.
In a sense, Nintendo is the victim of its own strategic foresight. With the Switch, it was the first to spot that the narrowing gap in processing power between mobile and at-home devices had enabled a unification of handheld and home gaming experiences. Finally, the same games could work in both contexts. The Switch proved this point emphatically, and now everyone wants a piece.
But with dedicated devices from Sony and Microsoft still years away, for now that competition must come from Steam Deck and the other PC handhelds. My colleague Chris Plante persuasively argued that these devices representNintendo’s “biggest threat in the present.”They trounce the Switch on specs and have closed the gap to contemporary AAA gaming in the home until it’s almost imperceptible. Software-wise, they offer the compelling value and staggering range of just about everything on Steam — and much of PC gaming beyond it, if you’re prepared to fiddle about a bit.
It’s true that the Switch 2’s price and specs put it into direct competition with the lower-end PC handhelds. At $449, it’s $50 more expensive than the base model Steam Deck. The Switch 2 isroughly comparable in power and storage, has a much better screen, and with detachable controllers and a TV dock included in the price, it’s much more flexible to use. The base model of Asus’ ROG Ally handheld ($499 or thereabouts) and the new Lenovo Legion Go S ($549) are also pretty close competitors in terms of specs.
In raw hardware terms, these are all very similar devices. It’s worth noting that the Switch 2’sexclusive accesstoNvidia’s market-leading DLSS upscaling technologyshould allow it to punch a bit above its weight class. But realistically, there’s not much between them.
But — and it’s a very, very big but — comparing the Switch 2 to the PC handhelds by running your finger down a spec sheet, or by noting that they can all playCivilization 7andElden Ring, does not tell the whole story. Within an enthusiast bubble, PC handhelds are a big deal, but they do not exist in the same universe as Nintendo consoles. To put it bluntly, PC handhelds are still niche.
The Steam Deck has been a big success for Valve, but let’s put it in perspective. Valve has not discussed sales numbers, but market research estimates thatit has sold around 4 million Steam Decks. And Steam Deck dwarfs its competition; the same research suggests that, in total, around 6 million PC handhelds have been sold in the three years since the Steam Deck went on the market. Worryingly, there aren’t yet signs of strong growth in sales.
Stack that up against the Switch’s 150 million units sold and the wild difference in scale becomes evident. Of course, it isn’t a directly analogous comparison. PC handhelds have only existed for three years; the Switch has been around for eight years, and Nintendo has been in the handhelds business for more than 35 years. All the same, Nintendo predicts it will sell11 million units of the aging Switchin its current fiscal year — more than five times the predicted sales of PC handhelds in that time. Meanwhile, analysts reckon that theSwitch 2 will, on its own, outstrip the size of the PC handheld marketalmost immediately, with 6 to 8 million units available at launch, and up to 20 million sales in its first year.
Valve is a big player in the game industry, and a very rich company. But it is a newcomer to the world of consumer electronics retail, and it has a lot of catching up to do — if it’s even interested in doing it. Steam Deck isn’t available to purchase in stores; you can’t walk into Walmart and pick one up. Valve is not buying ads for it on TV or at bus stops. Companies like Lenovo and Asus have more traditional distribution channels, but they’re tiny minnows compared to the marketing, retail, and distribution might of Nintendo.
There are other factors that make the PC handhelds niche products. The user experience of Windows-based handhelds like the ROG Ally and Legion Go is notoriously bad. Valve’s SteamOS is much better, but it is still quite far removed from the reliability and simplicity offered by Nintendo and the other console platforms.
You cannot unbox a new Steam Deck, turn it on, and play a game straight away. It requires tinkering to get the best out of. Although Valve’s verification system for games is a helpful guide, it’s not guaranteed you’ll get a good, playable experience on every game. The Deck is also bulky and heavy. You would never buy one for a child, or share one within a family — it’s clearly not designed to be shared. Realistically, it remains a tough sell for anyone who isn’t a gaming hobbyist.
There is, reportedly, one upcoming device that may be able to change this narrative a little. Microsoft is said to be working with a PC handheld manufacturer ona system that will have Xbox brandingand a user interface based on a new version of the Xbox PC app. This has the potential to be a more user-friendly device that offers easy access to PC Game Pass on the go, which would be quite compelling. But, although Microsoft has now been making Xbox consoles for over 20 years, it hasconsistently struggledto use that experience to make PC gaming more seamless, despite repeated attempts — and the device doesn’t sound like much more than a stopgap until Microsoft’s own dedicated handheld console is ready.
Nintendo will not have true competition in handhelds until its peers in the console space get involved. Microsoft is reportedly eyeing 2027 for the release of its handheld Xbox. Sony’s portable PS5 is also said to be years away, if it’s ever released. Things are definitely heating up for Nintendo, and by the end (or even the middle) of the Switch 2’s life, the handheld gaming market is sure to be much busier than it is now. But for the next few years, competition for the new console will remain distant — at best.

Disney Villains Cursed Café is the Modern AU of my dreams,2025-04-04T21:15:29Z,https://www.polygon.com/review/552799/disney-villains-cursed-cafe-review,"Am I enabling the Disney villains in their modern evil schemes? Maybe, maybe so
byPetrana Radulovic
I did something horrible. I told Jafar, the scheming vizier villain in Disney’sAladdin, about cryptocurrency, and now he’s determined to get WyshCoin off the ground by selling the luxurious lifestyle associated with the brand. The problem is he’s actually broke, so I need to brew him teleportation potion after teleportation potion so he can sneak into increasingly extravagant venues in order to sell the illusion of the WyshCoin lifestyle.
That’s just a day in the life of a potionista (a portmanteau of potion maker and barista) at the Cursed Café, the coffee shop at the center ofDisney Villains Cursed Café. The game is a partnership between Disney Studios and indie team Bloom Digital Media. InDisney Villains Cursed Café, I spend time brewing potions, talking to my villainous clientele and helping them achieve their goals (or sometimes, very specificallynothelping them). It’s a modern setting, which means the villains all have fun, contemporary designs — and contemporary problems.
Yes, Jafar’s setting up a cryptocurrency, and Snow White’s Evil Queen is running her own pyramid scheme. Meanwhile, Gaston is trying to impress his new golf bros at the country club he just joined. It’s hilarious to see what sorts of villainous shenanigans these iconic characters get up to in a modern, low-stakes setting. They’re taking over the world… in their own ways. And hey, in the year 2025, that does mean having huge social media followings!
The writing is sharp and funny, with some particularly pointed dialogue options (you can tell the villains that in this modern world, the rulers are the 1%, for instance). Seeing the characters interact is also a highlight. Cruella and the Evil Queen roll their eyes at Gaston’s attempts at dating on “the apps.” Maleficent and Ursula reluctantly team up for a social media collaboration. And throughout it all, the art style is incredibly charming, an elevated rendering of the characters’ Disney movie counterparts with some painterly accents.
With each in-game day, I have three chances to serve customers. Most of the time, this means picking between two villains to serve. But don’t worry — if it’s Cruella and Jafar at the counter and I pick Jafar, the rest of Cruella’s storyline will still unfold. The brewing mechanic is pretty straightforward; I just look at the recipe list to find the requested potion and then select the ingredients in my cupboards.
Occasionally, the villains will have bigger requests, and taking those on will continue the next big chapters of their plots. They’ll present me with their desired potion, often something malevolent and more complicated. My handy potion book will suggest a “good” option as well: It’ll have the same outcome, but probably result in less property damage. If you want to try a different option — or if you accidentally add the wrong ingredients — you’ll have the choice at the end of the day to buy a re-do from Yzma. The branching is simple, but enjoyable.
There is also an overarching mystery about the previous owner of the café that continues to perplex me — and is surprisingly complicated to figure out. One time, after I had messed up a day and intended to redo it, Yzma handed me a key that unlocked a secret room that held clues about this mysterious owner. But since I had fumbled the Evil Queen’s storyline, I erased the memories of that day to try again. The second time, though, I didn’t get the key — and a few in-game days later, I still haven’t! I’m not sure what conditions trigger more information about this storyline, but I’m determined to keep selling potions to find out.
But even if I’m still struggling at figuring out the grander mystery of the Cursed Café, I’m invested in the storylines of my customers. Even if I’m notactuallyinvesting in WyshCoin, every time I see Jafar at the counter, I eagerly select him to serve because I just want to know what the heck he’s scheming next. Maybe I’m tapping into my own inner villain by enabling him, but hey, you don’t become the favorite potion brewer of some of the best Disney villains by playing hero.

Nintendo built the Switch 2 for the next societal shutdown,2025-04-04T21:14:54Z,https://www.polygon.com/553024/nintendo-built-the-switch-2-for-the-next-societal-shutdown,"GameChat opens new doors for players, but the feature is haunted by the past and future

TheSwitch 2is a social machine. For the console’s second iteration, Nintendo prioritizedprocessing powercapable oflarge-scale multiplayer. TheJoy-Cons’ new C buttonlets you instantly join a group chat with shared-screen play options. Extensions in the Nintendo Switch Online app will add dimension to old titles, includingautobuild-sharing inThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. As producer Kouichi Kawamoto put it in Nintendo’s post-revealAsk the Developerupdate, development of the Switch 2 was inspired by memories of “playing games together as children at a friend’s house or in a student lounge, where everyone brought their own consoles.” The clear goal is to bring frictionless community play to Switch 2 that will be safe for all ages.
The pitch is harmonious on paper and, based on footage in theSwitch 2 Direct, existentially terrifying as a practice. Inspired by one of the defining experiences of the early 2020s, in which many of us were sequestered inside our homes playingAnimal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo has, intentionally or not, optimized Switch 2 for the next global shutdown.
Work on the Switch 2 began in earnest in 2019, according to Kawamoto, and the early focus was on improving software performance through tech upgrades. But development soon became entangled with the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdown protocols forced Nintendo’s teams, among millions and millions of others, to work from home. The frustrations the team experienced while making the setup work led to one of Switch 2’s major features: GameChat.
“Back then, we were using a video conferencing system to check the software we were developing with our team, but the screen-sharing function built into the video conferencing system only allowed us to share one gameplay screen at a time,” Kawamoto says in the Ask the Developer interview. “So, we had each person place their game screen in front of their camera instead of their faces. When we did that, it felt like we were all in the same place, each bringing our own console to play the game together, which was a lot of fun. Based on this experience, we proposed adding a feature to Switch 2 where people can share their gameplay screen with other players.”
As demonstrated in a video Nintendo released on Thursday, GameChat looks and feels exactly like a Discord or Zoom call. After receiving a notification for a GameChat invite from a friend, a player simply hits the C button to open a multi-window grid that allows for the seamless continuation of play while peeking in on whatever their friends are playing and chatting back and forth. The sizzle reel shows up to four people participating in a call, playing games individually or together in multiplayer spaces likeSplatoon 3andMario Party Jamboree. Players speak to each other using the onboard console mic and can activate video usingthe new Switch 2 camera accessory. If for some reason a Switch 2 player needed to remain in their house without making human contact for two to 12 months, Nintendo has them covered on the socializing front.
In many ways, Nintendo is beyond late to the game. Discord is right there, but even before the ubiquitous social platform, Microsoft strove for a similar connection when it launched Skype integration for the Xbox One in 2013, allowing for a party-chat-like experience. Nintendo’s dream of bringing distant friends closer together during remote play also predates GameChat; the Wii had the Wii Speak mic accessory and thefew people who bought a Wii Uhad the ability to ring friends with Wii U Chat. But GameChat stands to be the cleanest collision of social and play on a console yet, and one with greater protection for kids thanks to Nintendo’s walled-off friend-list gardens. In the Switch 2 era, no distance will keep friends apart.
It’s a far cry from the vision for the original Switch. Nintendo revealed that console ina vibrant 2016 teaserthat highlighted the hybrid console’s on-the-go possibilities. Players could kick back on the couch to play the new Zelda, or they could also traverse Hyruleliterally anywhere else— in airports, in parks, huddled around a beer hall picnic table with friends. Those memories of “playing games together as children” were part of the Switch DNA too, with an emphasis on breaking down the living room walls. With the Switch 2, Nintendo has retreated back indoors, and wants us to lean in closer to the TV.
Nintendo hasn’t abandoned the hybrid nature of the console and it never will, but GameChat’s Zoom aesthetic is a jarring departure from the limitlessness of the 2016 Switch reveal. In Nintendo’s promo video for Switch 2, good-looking 20-somethings chill in each of their loft apartments, remotely chit-chatting with each other as one playsZelda: Echoes of Wisdomand another explains the inner workings ofUntitled Goose Game. In another vignette, a Japanese woman tells her three friends about a pizza place they once visited together in the outside world, which she has recreated inAnimal Crossing: New Horizons, a game which has no negative connotations to our social reality whatsoever.
Read the news, and you know Nintendo is making a smart call. Ashas been widely reported over the last year, the outbreak potential of H5N1, dubbed “bird flu,” looms as the virus jumps from avian species to mammals. The fear at this present juncture is not just that H5N1 couldevolve to affect a wider spread of humansthan just poultry and dairy workerswho contract it on farms, but that combating bird flu is looking more and more like a potential U.S. infrastructure failure. Scientists say bird fluhas been under-addressed on a political levelover the last few years, while the Trump administration’s mission tocut jobs in the health sectormay impact the meager work that is being done. When asked recently what should be done about the continued emergence of bird flu, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s top health official, suggestedletting it run its course through bird populations, which scientists seem to agree is a pretty terrible way of mitigating viral mutation.
That’s a lot of doom to erupt out of the introduction of Nintendo’s GameChat function, but then again, who could forget the time when GameChat would make the most sense? During my quarantine days in 2020, I spent an ungodly number of evenings playingMario Kart 8 Deluxeonline with a few non-gamer friends who lived just a few blocks away. Like the majority of people, the easiest way for us all to catch up face to face and talk a bit of smack as we swerved around Rainbow Road was to load up the Switch on the TV and a Zoom call on a laptop. With Switch 2, we’ll have GameChat. In a way, I pray we never have to use it.
There are less apocalyptic reasons GameChat is a tremendous advancement. There are families spread out around the state, the country, the world, who will come together to playKirby Air Ridersand feel closer than they ever would over a quick FaceTime check-in. The FromSoftware fans will have a helluva time screaming at each other asthey embark on whateverThe Duskbloodsturns out to be. All of that will happen from the comfort of home — the same home, the same walls, the same sofa, the inescapable familiar.
The global population might completely avoid H5N1 or whatever the next close call looks like. Nintendo isn’t taking a chance. It has built a console for socializing in solitary confinement that, thankfully, still has a handheld mode. I’ll be taking it outside while I can.

"South of Midnight, Blue Prince, and the other new games out this week",2025-04-04T20:51:09Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/550720/best-new-game-releases-april-7-south-of-midnight-blue-prince,"This week is pure action and pure puzzle
byTyler Colp
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
The new game releases this week give you two choices: puzzles or action. There’s really no in between. Action fans get to fight monsters with magical powers inSouth of Midnightor take on intense multiplayer heists inMonaco 2. Puzzle fans get to explore an ever-changing mansion inBlue Princeor take the time to unravel the mysteries ofThe Talos Principle: Reawakened.
It’ll be a tough decision if you like both genres, because most of these games drop on the same day, but a few of them are less traditional than others.Star Overdrivesticks out in the action category as a game with monsters to fight but also hoverboard tricks to pull off. AndJumping Jazz Catsis a game where the action consists of an army of cats racing to complete minigames.
Here are our most anticipated game releases for the week of April 7.
Release date:April 8Platforms:Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis action game is steeped in folklore and set in the American Deep South. The world is infested with gruesome monsters that seem to be pain and trauma made manifest. Your job as Hazel, a magic-wielding Weaver, is to mend your community and hopefully find a place to call home yourself.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis pitch for this puzzle game is like nightmare mode for anyone in fear of getting stumped. It’s set in a mansion where the rooms and their puzzles change as each day passes. The goal is to find Room 46, but you’ll need to be extremely clever to keep up with the constantly shifting obstacles.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThey put the philosophical puzzle game into Unreal Engine 5. This updated version has all kinds of new stuff, including a new chapter in the story, quality-of-life improvements, and a tool to make puzzles yourself.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis co-op heist game requires teamwork and clever thinking. You get to play as unique characters with tools to overcome the various security measures and guards in your way. Each level is procedurally generated, too, so every run will be slightly different.
Release date:April 10Platforms:Nintendo SwitchTony Hawk’s Pro SkatermeetsNo Man’s Skyin this hoverboard action game. You get to ride around on alien planets, solve puzzles, and pull off tricks. And as if this game didn’t sound cool enough, you also fight enemies with a keytar.
Release date:April 10Platforms:Windows PCI’m not going to lie to you: I mostly chose this game simply because it’s calledJumping Jazz Cats. But it also looks pretty fun. You and up to eight other players get to run around and play minigames as little cats. Well, they’re called “minigames,” but they look more like a bunch of excuses to absolutely wreck the house of your absent owners.

Switch 2 continues the 20-year Nintendo tradition of not having achievements,2025-04-04T20:48:13Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements,"Achievements? Never heard of ‘em
byTyler Colp
TheSwitch 2won’t be joining the Xbox and PlayStation consoles with its own system-wide achievements, Nintendo confirmed to Polygon in a recent interview.
When we asked vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen if we can expect achievements, he gave a pretty clear answer: “Nope.”
Just like on Switch 1, it’ll be up to game developers to implement them in their own way. Ubisoft games, for example, have their own achievement system tied to Ubisoft Connect. When you earn them, they won’t show up on your Nintendo profile. And that’s not going to change with Switch 2.
But even though a traditional achievement system won’t exist, Nintendo is still experimenting with someachievement-like systemsin theSwitch 2 versions ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom. Both games will let you earn medals on the Nintendo Switch phone app. When you do things like travel long distances or collect a large number of rupees, those will be tracked inside the Zelda Notes part of the app, and you’ll be able to see how you compare against other players around the world.
That’s about as close as you’re going to get to achievements on Switch 2. Nintendo isn’t going to reward you for finishing first place as the cow inMario Kart World; that’ll be on you to celebrate when theSwitch 2 releases in June.

Where are all the first-party Switch 2 launch games?,2025-04-03T21:09:47Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/552601/switch-2-game-release-first-party-strategy,"﻿It turns out they’re hiding in plain sight
byOli Welsh
During anhourlong presentation on Wednesday, Nintendo bombarded prospective Switch 2 buyers with information about the new console and its games, including a torrent of ports from third-party publishers. But, once the dust had settled, it was easy to succumb to a creeping anxiety. Where were all the first-party launch titles from Nintendo itself?Mario Kart Worldlooks great, but isit $79.99 great?
Yes and no. Depending on how you define a launch game — and how you define a Switch 2 game — the Switch 2 will launch with anywhere between one and nine Nintendo games. You don’t have to expand these definitions to the absolute limit to realize that the Switch 2 is launching with relatively strong first-party support compared to Nintendo’s past systems. But it is true that Nintendo is approaching this launch a little differently.
First, a little historical perspective: In the last 20 years or so, new Nintendo consoles have launched with only two or three first-party games. For example, the Switch hadThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,1-2-Switch, andSnipperclips, a small eShop game. Further back, the Wii had the admittedly killerZelda: Twilight PrincessandWii Sportsdouble-header; the DS the more dubious pairing ofSuper Mario 64 DSandMetroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt.
In terms of Nintendo-made exclusive games, the Switch 2 has two titles on day one:Mario Kart WorldandNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour. But the latter is a download-only virtual guide to the hardware that most people wouldn’t consider a full launch title. So yes, compared to previous systems, it looks a little light.
But considerDonkey Kong Bananza, which is set for release on July 17 — just six weeks after the launch of the console. This is clearly a major new Nintendo platformer, and given what we know about Nintendo’s conservative approach to finishing games and setting launch dates, it seems likely the game would be ready to hit the June 5 launch day if Nintendo wanted it to. (It could well be finished already.)
It’s probable that Nintendo shiftedBananza’s launch date back as a deliberate marketing strategy, perhaps to extend the hype window beyond launch, perhaps to cover a second wave of stock. Or perhaps out of concern thatMario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananzamight cannibalize each other if launched together, because they’re both major titles. This is a key point. If we considerBananzaa launch title, and I think it’s only right to, then the Switch 2 is launching with two brand-new, exclusive Nintendo games of the highest order — which is arguably a first.
First-party support for Switch 2 goes even further when you considerSwitch 2 Editionsof existing Switch games. The system launches withenhanced versionsofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom, followed quickly in July bySuper Mario Party Jamboree, which has received a pretty extensive update tailored to the console’s GameChat features and camera. In August, Nintendo will release an expanded version ofKirby and the Forgotten Landwith a whole new storyline. Some of these upgrades, especially the Mario Party and Kirby releases, seem substantial enough to be compared to the Deluxe Switch versions of Wii U games likeMario Kart 8andNew Super Mario Bros. U.
(You can only get to nine first-party launch games by including the threeGameCube reissues, exclusive to Switch 2, on Nintendo Switch Online:The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Soulcalibur 2, andF-Zero GX. This is pushing it, I admit, although I would bet these will be some of my most-played games in my first weeks with the new console.)
Through the rest of 2025, we’ll getDrag x Drive,Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,Kirby Air Riders, and Switch 2 Editions ofMetroid Prime 4: BeyondandPokémon Legends: Z-A. All in all, across Switch 2 exclusives and Switch 2 Editions, Nintendo announced 12 titles coming in 2025 during Wednesday’s Direct.
That’s a lot of games by any measure. (Certainly compared to the first-party support given to Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 in their first nine months on the market.) It just looks different, partly because Nintendo is choosing to spread out its release dates, and partly because Switch 2 Editions are a more diffuse concept than the ports and remasters that have been Nintendo’s stock-in-trade on previous consoles. Nintendo is certainly hedging its bets a little with two of its biggest 2025 games,Metroid Prime 4: BeyondandPokémon Legends: Z-A, also coming to the Switch. But however you cut it, Switch 2 first-party support is a lot stronger than it might have seemed at first.

Is Nintendo making a mistake by charging for upgraded Switch 2 titles?,2025-04-03T17:22:47Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/552300/switch-2-edition-upgrade-cost-question,"﻿It hasn’t gone well for Sony. But Nintendo’s strategy is a bit different
byOli Welsh

During Wednesday’sSwitch 2 Direct, Nintendo revealed that some games for the original Switch could be upgraded to enhancedSwitch 2 Editionsby purchasing an upgrade pack. This isn’t surprising, coming from a company that has long loved to repackage old games for new consoles and sell them to fans a second (or third, or fourth) time. But it left some observers feeling that Nintendo was nickel-and-diming its fans — and it’s a strategy that comes with risks.
When launching a console that’sfully backward-compatible with its predecessor’s games, console makers have some tricky choices to make. One of the trickiest involves how to handle pricing and upgrades when there are versions of the same game for both platforms — particularly if the platform holder is increasing the price of games on the new system (as Nintendo is).
Both Sony and Microsoft were faced with this conundrum when they launched their most recent consoles, and they made very different choices. Microsoft’s policy is both generous and simple: Any Xbox One games are upgraded to Xbox Series X editions automatically and at no extra cost. If you own the newer console, you can rest easy that you are always playing the best version of the game without thinking about it, and without shelling out for it.
Sony’s policy is a bit less generous, and much more confusing. Some upgrades from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5 versions of games are free. (Quite a few, to be fair.) Many are not; it costs $10 to upgrade a copy ofMarvel’s Spider-ManorGrand Theft Auto 5to the PS5 version, for example. Sometimes this upgrade path was only available for a limited time. Sometimes it’s not available at all, and your only option, if you already own the game on PS4, is to buy it all over again on PS5.
Understandably, this messy, costly system didn’t go down well with PlayStation players. WhenHorizon Forbidden Westwas announced with no upgrade path, fans were so upset that Sony was forced to back down,offer a free upgrade, and pledge to always offer upgrades in the future (albeit for a price). This is the minefield that Nintendo is now stepping into.
There are a few caveats, however. Firstly, Nintendo did not announce pricing for its upgrade packs, and how players feel about the upgrades will depend to a large extent on where this pricing lands. Also, will the upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which improves performance and comes with somecompanion-app features, cost the same as theSwitch 2upgrade forKirby and the Forgotten Land, which adds a whole new expansion to the game? Maybe, maybe not. To complicate things further, theSwitch 2 Edition upgrades forBreath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomwill be included in a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription, but others won’t.
That’s not all. Nintendo is also offering asecond tier of free Switch 2 patchesfor games likeSuper Mario OdysseyandPokémon ScarletandViolet. These don’t count as full Switch 2 Editions, but they will “improve playability” and “may improve performance or add support for features such asGameShare,” depending on the game.
As with PS5, it’s quite a confusing picture — especially since we don’t yet know pricing, or how third-party publishers will choose to handle Switch 2 Editions. (On PlayStation, many — if not most — opted to offer free upgrades.) But there is one important factor that distinguishes Nintendo’s strategy from Sony’s.
The only enhancements offered by many PS5 upgrades were in terms of visuals and performance: higher resolutions and frame rates, ray-traced lighting, or new performance and quality modes. Players felt they were being asked to spend $10 per game to unlock the power of the console they had already bought.
Nintendo seems to have a policy that visual upgrades aren’t enough for a Switch 2 Edition. The Zelda games come with the (admittedly not very compelling) Zelda Notes companion features.Super Mario Party Jamboreehas a new play mode, and makes extensive use of Switch 2 features like mouse controls and the camera.Kirby and the Forgotten Landhas a whole new story.Metroid Prime 4: Beyondhas mouse controls. It seems clear that Nintendo always wants to add value in a Switch 2 Edition, either through additional content, use of the Switch 2’s unique features (beyond its increased processing power), or both. Some of these releases — Kirby and Mario Party especially — would seem to be on a par with the Switch’s Deluxe editions of Wii U games likeMario Kart 8andNew Super Mario Bros. U. (There’s one exception to this rule: The Switch 2 Edition ofPokémon Legends: Z-Adoes not feature any upgrades beyond a visual one, at least for now.)
That should make the upgrade pack cost, however much it may be, easier to stomach. (Charging for upgrade packs will surely make all that extra development time easier for Nintendo to stomach.) It’s a fairer proposition than Sony’s, if hardly a less confusing one. But Xbox owners — and PC gamers, for that matter, who never have to worry about such things — would be justified in feeling quite smug by comparison.

"South of Midnight weaves a spellbinding tale of grief, loss, and hope",2025-04-02T23:38:41Z,https://www.polygon.com/review/551840/south-of-midnight-review,"The dark tales of the Deep South
byJason Rodriguez
Early on in my near-12-hourSouth of Midnightplaythrough, I defeated Two-Toed Tom, a gargantuan andlegendaryalligator that’s said to have stalked the swamplands of Florida and Alabama as early as the 1920s. After breathing a sigh of relief upon completing the battle, I was shocked when Two-Toed Tom swallowed my character, Hazel, whole. I was even more surprised upon realizing that I had to escape the gator’s belly in a platforming section complete with floating planks, ruined houses, and even a lost pig — everything that Tom had previously gobbled up.
Indeed,South of Midnightis the melding of the weird and the macabre, the magical and the utterly dreadful, a tantalizing offering that delves deeper into its roots in the Deep South. However, it still has some glaring flaws, most notably with its combat system.
InSouth of Midnight, you play as Hazel Flood, a young woman searching for her mother after a hurricane devastates the town of Prospero. After a few twists and turns, you learn that Hazel is a Weaver, someone who wields magic to see through the material plane and into a world that’s shrouded in shadow and spiritual essences.
What follows is an unforgettable journey where you meet a host of characters and creatures derived from Southern folklore. These include the giant catfish, a staple of old tales in the region; the aforementioned Two-Toed Tom; and even a giant man known as Shakin’ Bones, who’s partly based on Charon, the ferryman of the dead from Greek mythology, and blues legend Robert Johnson, rumored to havesold his soul to the devil to become a master at guitar.
There are also terrifying beings whose stories are unique to certain locations, such asHuggin’ Molly. Molly was believed to be a phantom woman who’d find naughty children who were out at night in the quaint town of Abbeville, Alabama. She’d swoop in and squeeze kids tightly before shrieking into their ears. Likewise, there’s theAltamaha-ha, a sea monster whose legend is rooted in Muscogee tradition, and with multiple alleged sightings in parts of Georgia.
South of Midnighteasily pulled me in through its masterful use of engrossing folklore and tall tales, though it’s the nuanced exploration of dark themes and harsh realities that truly resonated with me. You see, Hazel’s job as a Weaver is to mend stigmas, wounds caused by heinous acts — wounds that fester in the immaterial realm before seeping into reality. The story is filled with emotionally impactful moments, such as with Hazel’s mother, a social worker who’s looking for a way to save impoverished kids who have been failed by the system, and that of the ghosts of plantation slaves finding their way to freedom. Just as well, there are equally disturbing segments of the game’s story, including fratricide, bullying, animal abuse, and hatefulness against those deemed to be too different.
Look, I won’t pretend that I’m an expert in Southern gothic lore or history — I live in the Philippines, which is 9,000 miles away from any state in the Bible Belt. The closest I’ve been to the South was when I worked in Virginia for a few months back in 2004, and that’s still quite far from Georgia or Alabama.
That said,South of Midnightdid present stark truths that are relatable all the same. In some ways, my people, too, relied on the power of mysticism, superstition, and folktales to shape our Filipino identity and to become more resilient in the face of adversity. It’s not uncommon for people in the provinces to warn you of creatures liketikbalangs,kapres, andduwendes, or to espouse the protective and restorative properties of mystical beliefs (which also clash with traditional Catholic teachings). Moreover, the game’s narrative draws on the universal themes of hope and determination: that there are people out there who are willing to help, that there are ways to heal the traumatic events of the past, and that children will move heaven and earth for their parents (and vice versa).
South of Midnight’s story is further enhanced by striking visuals and the use of stop-motion animation in cutscenes. While the latter might be hard to get used to at first — you’ll be roaming around the swamps at a blistering pace, then see a stop-motion cutscene at a lower frame rate — the concept ultimately adds to the gothic-fantasy charm. In the same vein, the soundtrack, made by composer Olivier Derivière (A Plague Tale: Innocence/RequiemandVampyr), might be one of the best I’ve had the joy of listening to in recent memory. There’s a mix of melodic blues and country music, as well as a church hymn at one point. The song lyrics themselves either focus on Hazel’s plight or pertain to a particular boss, punctuating every significant moment in the campaign, from the somber expressions of grief to the pulse-pounding crescendo of an upcoming battle.
The exploration and platforming mechanics, which reminded me somewhat of Ember Lab’sKena: Bridge of Spirits, are exceptionally well designed, too. The game’s 14 levels — consisting of (mostly) fetid swamplands and mountainside villages, as well as a short trek to a glitzy New Orleans-esque city, albeit one with landmasses floating over a vast expanse — are all fairly linear. That said, exploration is still encouraged, as there are small areas that are off the beaten path. Some of these contain health filaments, which upgrade Hazel’s HP, or a resource called Floofs, which are used to unlock skills in a very bare-bones skill tree.
On top of this, Hazel gains a plethora of powers and abilities in just a few hours, allowing you to make use of various traversal methods, like a magical grapple to cross gaps, wind currents to fly through the air, a spell that solidifies spectral objects, and a Force Pull/Force Push-esque ability reminiscent of a Jedi. There’s even a reanimated doll, Crouton, perhaps a nod to Hoodoo spiritualism, that you control to gain access to small areas and burrows. Additionally, you can make a wispy guiding path appear with the press of a button, showing the way forward complete with disembodied voices calling out to your character.
My only complaint with regard to overall level design is that I wish puzzles were trickier and more expansive. There were instances when Hazel would remark about how a contraption might need power or that she had to reach a certain location, yet the solutions to these problems were simple. Sometimes, all I had to do was make Crouton push a switch in a small nook or toss a rock at a breakable object. Having more brain teasers would have enriched the game’s fantasy and mystery elements.
Regrettably, the combat system inSouth of Midnightis its weakest aspect. As you make your way through each level, you come across larger clusters of stigma that spawn monsters known as “haints” (a Southern term for ghosts or evil spirits). Enemy variety is fairly limited, as you end up facing shadowy specters that use claws, exploding flies, or gooey spit. To take out these foes, you use Hazel’s aforementioned traversal abilities, which have their own equivalent effects in combat; you can temporarily stun foes by solidifying them, you can push/pull enemies, and you can make Crouton take control of a hostile to attack its own cohorts.
Level progression feels like it’s structured with combat encounters in mind, and the result is that all the levels feel the same after a while. Essentially, this consists of exploring a section, finding a stigma cluster, defeating a couple of enemy waves to finish the encounter, watching a short cutscene about the past, and then clearing the remaining clusters, before going through a chase sequence where an otherworldly entity is hot on your heels. The last part — the chase sequence — is exciting, but the rest is mostly just lather, rinse, and repeat until you’re done.
The battles themselves are very forgiving even on normal difficulty; your dodges cause damaging explosions, and you can heal by unraveling defeated enemies or by interacting with a glowing green orb. However, the structure became too repetitive to a fault that, at the halfway point, I honestly wondered if I should just enable the “Skip Combat” option so I could get to the good parts faster. Outside of a select few bouts against bosses and mythical creatures, there are no other encounters that offer the same level of excitement. It’s a darn shame given how much the game excels when it comes to the “adventure” aspect, and yet the “action” part is egregiously boring and uninspired.
All in all, even with my qualms about the combat system,South of Midnightstill managed to exceed my expectations. It has the 3D platforming goodness that should appeal to fans of the genre, and levels that are a joy to explore from a traversal standpoint. More importantly, its compelling story hooks you with its excellent use of the often underrepresented Deep South as a setting, along with its rich folktales and troubled history. And yes, it comes as no surprise that the game explores dark and unsettling themes, all while reminding us that love, forgiveness, and acceptance help mend old wounds.
South of Midnightwill have an early access release on April 3 and a wide release on April 8 on Windows PC and Xbox Series X. The game was reviewed on PC using a copy provided by Compulsion Games.

Farewell physical media — some Nintendo Switch 2 games aren’t on the carts,2025-04-02T23:27:29Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551614/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards,"Old man yells at The Cloud
byChristopher Grant
It’s a good thing that theNintendo Switch 2comes with a base 256 GB of internal storage — eight times more than the original Switch’s paltry 32 GB — because some Nintendo Switch 2 games won’t come on the cartridge at all. Instead, so-called game-key cards will simply contain a “key” that you will use to download the game, according toa support page on Nintendo’s website.
“After it’s downloaded, you can play the game by inserting the game-key card into your system and starting it up like a standard physical game card,” the page reads. Here’s how that looks on the retail packaging:
Some additional fine print on how this works:
An internet connection is only required when you launch the game for the first time. After this, the game can be started even without an internet connection. However, like regular physical software, the game-key card must be inserted into the system in order to play the game.
In some ways, this is a new spin on an old trick. Some Nintendo Switch games have been sold at retail, but the packaging simply included a code used to download the game to your account. To be fair, this hasn’t been as common on Switch as it has been on competing consoles, but nevertheless, for the people still committed to purchasing physical games, it riles. This is, in fact, the same tactic that Microsoft (in)famously unveiled alongside the Xbox One; of course, that was over a decade ago, and consumer sentiment has changed. We’re all Game Passing and PS Plus-ing our games, and maybe potentially feel some “ownership” over the digital goods we’re purchasing on Steam. Maybe.
But I’m one of those physical media people! First, I’m scientifically “old.” I was born in the 1970s, my first job was at a video store (ask your parents), and I still have a large collection of video games (and video game consoles ?). I understand that I am not the target demographic, in many ways. But also, until the Switch, the prospect of purchasing digital Nintendo games was foolish! If you lost your Nintendo DS or 3DS on a bus — a not-unheard-of scenario for a portable game console — your digital purchases were gone. Here I am yelling aboutNintendo’s shoddy online servicesin2012 just before the launch of the Wii U, and again in2017 just before the launch of the Switch.
The good news: I don’t need to write that same piece again! Nintendo has kinda figured this out. I still buy my Switch games in cartridge format, not because I’m afraid of losing the Switch (and, by extension, my entire library), but because doing so makes it easier to share games with friends and family, including people in my own household. But I also genuinely worry about what happens when companies — and maybe, specifically here, Nintendo — take their own game servers offline. Can I download what I bought?How do I play older gamesI care about? Microsoft has been working to address theunsatisfactory vibes of digital ownership, and I often point out that my Steam library persists even as so (so, so) many of the developers and publishers behind the games in my Steam library no longer do.
So let’s call this a sign of the times. We don’t know how often Nintendo and its publishing partners will use this “game-key card” solution, and maybe in some cases it’s the right answer — surely some games will simply be too large to fit on this storage device. Switch game cards capped out at 32 GB, while thecoming-to-Switch-2Cyberpunk 2077comes on a massive 64 GB game card, according to a press release. That’s a lot of expensive one-time storage, and with the Switch 2 competing with the PlayStations and Xboxes of the world foreven more third-party titles, you can imagine storage requirements going up from there. Even if it maybe makes sense, I don’t have to like it.
[Update: Added details on theCyberpunk 2077game card size, and information on internet requirements to use game-key cards.]

Switch 2 Direct’s technical difficulties swallowed up a whole new game reveal,2025-04-02T19:53:40Z,https://www.polygon.com/pc/551732/switch-2-direct-astroneer-starseeker-co-op,"The developers ofAstroneerwere robbed of their trailer debut

Nintendo’s Switch 2 Directstream suffered technical issues at the most inopportune time for the developers ofAstroneer. Near the end of Wednesday’s presentation, a trailer for their new game debuted on the stream during a period where many viewers were stuck looking at a glitchy mess.
“Hey so uh one of the mainNintendo Switch 2 Directstreams completely ate our trailer due to I guess technical difficulties?” System Era Softworks social media manager Lotus Dwyer wrote onBluesky.
The new game is calledStarseeker: Astroneer Expeditions, and if things had gone right, you could’ve recognized the similarities to the studio’s previous game almost immediately. It’s a cooperative game with colorful planets full of weird creatures and plant life. TheBluesky postwith the trailer describes it as a game about “the joy of discovery and the camaraderie that emerges from an evolving, cooperative experience,” which suggests your crew of goofy astronauts will visit many different planets than the one we saw.
Over on theSteam page, the description points out that each planet will have different objectives that can only be completed by using your team’s set of tools. Between missions, you’ll return to “an ever-evolving space station” known as the ESS Starseeker to get upgrades and plan your next expedition.
System Era Softworks saysStarseekertakes place in theAstroneeruniverse, but isn’t a direct sequel.Astroneerwill continue to be updated “for years to come.”

Nintendo wants to compete in a new type of console war,2025-04-02T19:26:30Z,https://www.polygon.com/analysis/551719/nintendo-switch-2-console-war,"Why Nintendo wants Madden and Borderlands on its new handheld
byChris Plante
Nintendo took an unusual approach to the past two decades of video game console wars. It stayed out of them. But with today’sNintendo Switch 2 info dump— packed with big-name third-party games rarely seen onNintendo hardware— the House that Mario Built appears ready to rejoin the fray. Why now? Credit a collision of confidence, opportunity, and necessity.
Sony and Microsoft have spent generations bloodying each other in a battle for the most extravagant visuals, courting favor with major publishers like Activision and Electronic Arts. Meanwhile, Nintendo swam in the opposite direction, favoring cheaper, less powerful machines that prioritized toy-like novelty over raw specs.
The historic successes of both the Wii and the Switch obscure how risky this gamble has been. The slower hardware — with a few, better-forgotten exceptions — couldn’t run the latest entries in gaming’s most popular franchises, including Madden, Call of Duty, and Grand Theft Auto. Survival hinged on Nintendo’s ability to produce multiple exclusive hits each year, with smaller indie titles filling the gaps.
With the Switch, everything went Nintendo’s way — by both design and good fortune. The publisher assembled arguably the greatest first-party lineup in history. Indie development exploded. And a new wave of beloved IP —Minecraft,Fortnite, Roblox — designed for smartphone-level specs meant that Nintendo’s hardware, unintentionally, could play some of the biggest games on the planet.
And yet, today, Nintendo’s hourlongSwitch 2reveal stream featured anabundance of titlesonce rare on its systems. 2K Games showed off new entries in the WWE, Civilization, and Borderlands franchises. Other developers, like IO Interactive, pledged to bring hits once best experienced on Xbox or PlayStation, like Hitman and the upcomingProject 007. Square Enix showed theremakes ofFinal Fantasy 7, and EA appeared, committing EA Sports FC and Madden to the platform.
It’s possible that coming off the success of the Switch — a far cry from Nintendo’s grim posture after the Wii U — the gamemaker feels positioned to push into the third-party territory ceded to Sony and Microsoft, the latter of which seems to be clinging to its hardware business by its fingertips. After all, Nintendo has sold over 150 million Switch consoles — more than the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S combined.
It’s also possible a mix of luck and industry trends will once again favor Nintendo. Sony and Microsoft’s reluctance to fully leave the PS4 and Xbox One era behind — coupled with a generation raised on mobile gaming — has trained AAA developers to build for underpowered hardware. TheSwitch 2will still trail behind top-tier machines in horsepower, but that may no longer matter. Most major franchises simply don’t demand cutting-edge specs.
Both of those are likely a piece of the puzzle. But I believe Nintendo’s decision to release amore expensiveand slightly morepowerful devicemay have less to do with past console wars and more to do with its biggest threat in the present. In 2025, Valve’s Steam Deck does what the Switch doesn’t: It lets players enjoy most AAA games anytime, anywhere — and offers many of the same indie titles at steep discounts. (That it also runs emulated games from every Nintendo console ever released surely isn’t lost on the company either, as it continues its crackdown on third-party emulation.)
If Nintendo once again ignores third parties and their graphical needs, it would find itself competing against a growing number of handhelds that offer more power and more games, often with better specs — albeit higher prices.
Inexplicably, Microsoft and Sony burned an entire hardware cycle without answering the Switch’s key selling point: portability. It took a PC gaming marketplace — with almost no hardware pedigree — to offer legitimate competition. And Nintendo, with the Switch 2’s higher price, greater power, and suite of PC-like social features, seems to be taking the threat seriously.
Yes, Nintendo has reentered the modern console wars. Maybe, one day, Sony and Microsoft will too.

Switch 2 games are breaking the $70 game price barrier,2025-04-02T19:00:55Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551684/game-prices-mario-kart-world,"Nintendo’s new Mario Kart is pricey
byMichael McWhertor
We knew there was a new Mario Kart coming to Switch 2, but we didn’t expect it to cost this much. After showing off the open-world racing gameMario Kart Worldon Wednesday during itsSwitch 2 Nintendo Directshowcase, Nintendo revealed that the game will have a $79.99 price tag. That’s new territory for Nintendo, which just two years ago made headlines bycharging $69.99forThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
ButMario Kart World’s high asking price doesn’t appear to be the standard for Switch 2 software. Nintendo also confirmed Wednesday thatDonkey Kong Bananza, coming to Switch 2 in July, will cost $69.99. Still, these are indicators that Nintendo is comfortable charging more not just for the Switch successor, but for its next-gen games too.
Those prices may only represent the digital versions of those Switch 2 games. Pricing announced in some territories shows that Nintendo plans to charge even more for the physical editions of games likeMario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananza.
Nintendo has not announced prices for other games or the Switch 2 upgrade packs that were revealed as part of Wednesday’s Nintendo Direct, though it did put a price on another Switch 2 launch game,Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, if only in Japan. That virtual exploration of the Switch 2 hardware will cost 990 yen for a digital copy, which will probably translate to a sub-$10 price in the U.S.
Price increases on software aren’t uncommon during next-generation console transitions. When the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 launched, standard game pricing jumped from $49.99 to $59.99, a price point that held steady for more than a decade. In 2020, alongside the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, prices crept up further, with some publishers charging $69.99 for certain games. Nintendo itself caught up with that trend withTears of the Kingdom,following Microsoft’s lead, with its first $69.99 game.
Despite the reality of inflation, the increasing cost of game development, and the value often associated with live-service games like Mario Kart, reaction to pricing for Switch 2 games has beenwidely negative. Combined with thehigh price of the Switch 2itself, Nintendo may have a harder time reaching the success of the original Switch than some expected.

January’s Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event took the wraps off the console, but left a lot of details unanswereduntil now. After the initial reveal, I put togetheran analysis of the possible pricingfor the console, using Nintendo’s own historical pricing strategies to guide my thinking. My conclusion then was that it would cost $399.
I…was wrong. The Nintendo Switch 2 will debut in Junestarting at $449.99, with a $499.99 version that includesMario Kart World.
At that price, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be the most expensive console Nintendo has ever released, by some margin. And even adjusted for inflation, and when considering the various bundle packages of previous Nintendo consoles, the Nintendo Switch 2 will still be the most expensive Nintendo console ever made!
It’s not quite June yet, so I can’t update this chart to reflect the inflation-adjusted price to the same date of the Switch 2 launch, but the prices from February of this year are pretty illustrative of the change here.
[Ed. note:An earlier version of this list didn’t include information on pack-in games included in some console releases, and didn’t include the various NES bundles and prices. Adjusted for inflation, only the very first NES release — a tricked-out bundle originally limited to test markets only — would be more expensive than the Nintendo Switch 2. Once you compare it to the more widely released Control Deck release just a few months later, the relative cost of the Nintendo Switch 2 is clear.]
But it wasn’t just me that was wrong! Nearly 57% of ourpoll respondents agreedwith my predicted $399 price, and just 9% thought it would come in at $449. (If that was you, congratulations!) Is that indicative that Nintendo will have a hard time moving units at $449, or simply that people didn’t think Nintendo would go that high? It’s too early to say.
Earlier reporting from Bloomberg, citing multiple industry analysts, pegged the pricebetween $399 and $499, so… nailed it?
On price, the analysts Bloomberg spoke to are unanimous in expecting the Switch 2 to cost at least $399 — which, again, agrees with Polygon’s own analysis. Some think it could go higher, to $449 or even $499, driven by the cost of components and fears over the impact of U.S. tariffs. At $499 it would be the same price as a PlayStation 5 (and $50 more than a digital-only model).
Here again is a list of all of the current-gen consoles, now including the Switch 2 and its confirmed pricing:
At $449, the Switch 2 will go toe to toe on pricing with the all-digital variants of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, which is in keeping with the Switch’s 2017 launch price that matched the $299 being asked for the PS4 Slim and Xbox One S. It’s worth noting, however, that $299 in 2017 dollars still comes in under $400 in today’s bucks, when adjusted for inflation. It’s not just you — everything really is just more expensive!
One last consideration: While the Switch 2’s specs actually put it a notch above the Steam Deck in some key categories, like resolution and including a 4K-compatible dock out of the box, I didn’t expect Valve’s portable gaming PC to beat Nintendo on pricing. The Steam Deck APU is going on three years old at this point, and a little long in the tooth, but it’s hard to argue against the value embedded in Valve’s storefront. (I boughtUndertalefor $1 recently just to have another copy.) So with Valve continuing to make a name for itself, and with Microsoftreportedly entering the portable gaming spacethis year in partnership with Asus, Nintendo no longer has the exclusive lock on the portable gaming market.
Update: I updated the headline and some of the opening paragraphs, along with the first pricing comparison chart, to reflect that when evaluated on a more like-to-like basis the Nintendo Switch 2, with and without a pack-in game, is in fact the most expensive Nintendo console ever released, when adjusted for inflation.

It follows months of slim pickings following the console’s initial hardware-focused reveal in January, which also saw developers and publishers holding fire of their involvement until now.
The following Switch 2 games list explains the exclusives, third-party games, and confirmed developers and publishers for the console from the launch and beyond.
Update (April 8):Added two new games —Mouse Workand a Switch 2 version of the recentSuikoden I&II HDremaster.
First, let’s look at the exclusive games coming to the Switch 2, whether that’s from Nintendo itself or from third-parties:
As well as the above full exclusives, there’s a series of“Nintendo Switch 2 Edition”titles, which are Switch 1 games “patched” to make the most out of the Switch 2 hardware (and is different tobackward compatibility). These are available as both “upgrade packs” if you own the Switch 1 version, or as standalone editions for the Switch 2:
Elsewhere, those with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription will get the following“GameCube Classics”from launch day:
As well as the above list of exclusives and Switch 2-specific editions of Switch 1 games, here’s a breakdown of other games confirmed for the Switch 2 from third-parties that are either already on other systems, or are debuting on multiple platforms:

FromSoftware announces The Duskbloods as a Switch 2 exclusive,2025-04-02T14:30:49Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/550315/fromsoftware-new-game-the-duskbloods-switch-2-direct,"﻿The creators of Elden Ring are making a game for the Switch 2
byAna Diaz
FromSoftware, the renowned development studio behind popular games likeElden Ringand the Dark Souls series, announced a brand new game at theNintendo Directon Wednesday. It’s calledThe Duskbloodsand it’s set to be released sometime in 2026, exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2.
The Duskbloodsis an online multiplayer game that supports up to eight players, per thegame’s official website.
The developers aired a short trailer that showed off some of the world and general concepts behind the game. It’s dripping in dark, gothic vibes and the opening intro references an unknown knight of “light.” The game appears to feature a completely original concept with a new world and cast of characters (one of which looks like it preys on a monster like a vampire). That said, the title of the game has many wondering if it’s set in theBloodborneuniverse.
The news comes just after FromSoftware made another big announcement at the Nintendo Switch 2 event. Its global hit,Elden Ring, will be getting a Switch 2 port so even more people will be able to take up the journey and fight as The Tarnished. (TheElden Ring Tarnished Editionport will be released in 2025).
As for non-Switch 2 news, FromSoftware still has some other projects cooking. The studio’s next big game,Elden Ring Nightreign, is set to be released on May 30. There was no mention ofNightreignat the Direct and as of writing, thefast-paced, co-op spinoffwill be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.
For those who want to learn more, game director Hidetaka Miyazaki will share more aboutThe Duskbloodsin a developer diary series called Creator’s Voice on Friday.

Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are getting Switch 2 upgrades,2025-04-02T13:44:04Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/550745/zelda-botw-totk-switch-2-upgrade,"See Hyrule the way it was meant to be seen

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomfans will be able to see the era-defining Nintendo titles in a new light on Nintendo Switch 2 with a duo of enhanced visual upgrades, Nintendo announced Wednesday during itsNintendo Direct presentation about the new console. If you already own the games, you won’t automatically have the Switch 2 version and will need to purchase an upgrade pack to get it. However, Switch Online subscribers who have the Expansion Pack tier and own copies of these games will get the upgrades for no additional cost, according toNintendo.
The Switch 2 version of each game will include a “Zelda Notes” feature, which will provide game tips to players; you can use this Switch 2-only feature via the Nintendo Switch app on smart devices. It can help you find Korok seeds, for example. That’s in addition to enhanced resolution and frame rates and HDR support.
Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomhave earned their place among the greatest video games of all time, and delivered on the promise of a truly open-world Zelda game where you could see a mountain in the distance and then go climb it. Both games managed this feat on the Switch, which, as a device designed for both big-screen and handheld play, was significantly underpowered compared to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (and later, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X).
Of course, this experience wasn’t without its compromises; at launch forBreath of the Wild, certain areas of the world exhibitednotable performance problems, especially when played in the Switch’s docked mode. Less than a month later,Nintendo issued a patch that made significant improvementsbut didn’t completely alleviate frame-rate drops below 30 frames per second.
Now, the Switch 2’s beefed-up hardware will be able to renderBreath of the Wild’s version of Hyrule with a much fuller degree of fidelity and fluidity.
Update: Added that Switch Online subscribers with the Expansion Pack tier get both Switch 2 Edition versions ofBreath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomfor no added cost if you own them already.

All our predictions for the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct,2025-04-01T19:16:59Z,https://www.polygon.com/analysis/550710/switch-2-nintendo-direct-predictions,"Less than 24 hours remain until Nintendo’s big Switch 2 Direct
byMichael McWhertor
It’s the dawn of the final day. On Wednesday, April 2, Nintendo promises to give its fans a closer look atSwitch 2, the successor to its wildly popular portable-console hybrid. And while Nintendo is famously secretive and unpredictable, there’s a lot we already know about Switch 2.
Still, there are manyunanswered questions about Switch 2, and Nintendo’s ability to keep information under wraps and preserve surprises means that what we think we know about the next-generation Switch likely pales in comparison to whatthis week’s 60-minute Nintendo Directwill reveal.
That said, here are our best predictions for the impending Nintendo Direct that’s all about Switch 2.
With the Switch 2 expected to launch as early as June, Nintendo will likely reveal the release date, price, and when customers can pre-order the system. Based on what we’ve heard,Switch 2 pre-orders should go live at most retailers on April 9, giving Nintendo fans a window to consider their purchases and not have to scramble to pre-order one immediately after the Nintendo Direct. (In some territories, like Nintendo’s home base in Japan, the Direct won’t conclude until late at night.)
Switch 2, based on what we’ve heard, is expected to launch in the first half of June.
We expect the price to besomewhere between $399 and $449. Nintendo may be waiting until the very last minute to decide price, which — inthiseconomy — seems like a tough decision to make.
Nintendo not only added a brand-new button to the Switch 2 Joy-Cons, it’s beenteasing that new C button’s functionalityahead of time on its recently launched Nintendo Today app. What the C button does is still a mystery for now, but all signs point to a new chat tool or community-focused feature.
We’ll find out what the C button is for, officially, on Wednesday. But based on Nintendo’s increasing fascination with big multiplayer games, and last year’sNintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program, which tested “the boundaries of mass multiplayer functionality and gameplay” on Nintendo’s servers, we expect some sort of big, Nintendo-controlled community feature or MMO-scale game to be shown — and that would be a great opportunity to showcase the new C button functionality, if it is indeed chat- or community-focused.
We’re getting a new Mario Kart, that’s for sure. But what else Nintendo has planned for Switch 2 is a big mystery. We expect at least one game to show off theSwitch 2 Joy-Cons’ new mouse-control featuresand probably a new Super Mario game.
Nintendo also has to give Switch owners a long list of reasons to upgrade to Switch 2, and the best way to do that is through compelling software.Mario Kart 9would be a big deal, of course, but we expect Nintendo to show up with a teaser or announcement of at least one other big franchise, like Animal Crossing, Super Smash Bros., or Splatoon.
But Nintendo will also likely showcase how well Switch games run on Switch 2. Maybe the best way to do that would be to showThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildorTears of the Kingdomrunning on Switch 2, at higher resolution and with better frame rates. First details on“Switch 2 Edition” versions of gameswill definitely be a talking point.
Third-party software publishers will likely open the floodgates of their back catalogs to bring games from PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X to a new console. But don’t expect that flood of ports to be showcased at the Nintendo Direct. Instead, we anticipate that only a handful of major third-party publishers like Capcom, Sega, Microsoft, and Ubisoft will get some space during the Direct to show their support for Switch 2.
Nintendo is reportedly being cautious about which third-party developers are getting Switch 2 development kits ahead of launch, but we expect that to change once details about the new system are in the wild.

Armored Core’s stellar first generation finally available on modern consoles — with a catch,2025-03-31T20:59:30Z,https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/549692/armored-core-original-games-play-now-playstation-human-plus,"The PlayStation classics are emulated (almost) flawlessly
byClayton Ashley
The exceptionalArmored Core 6: Fires of Rubiconis easy to purchase and play on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or PC. Every other game in the series? Not so much.Most of the previous 15 Armored Core games aren’t available on digital storefronts or backward-compatible on modern systems. That is, until March, when the very firstArmored Coreand its two expansion games for the PlayStationwere made available for digital purchase, and for free for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers on PS4 and PS5.
Though it’s nearly 30 years old,Armored Coreholds up incredibly well. Despite its odd control setup, it’s easy to see how the series’ high-speed mecha gameplay inspired such a devoted fan base. The bright, retro polygonal graphics look pristine on modern high-definition televisions, and customizing your Armored Core is still the absorbing heart of the experience. It’s also a chance to see the wild ideas FromSoftware was cooking up decades ago, like the new game plus mode you could only access by going into debt.
This was called “Human PLUS,” and it tied into the game’s dystopian sci-fi story. Completing missions earned players credits, but a chunk of their payment was always taken out to cover repairs and ammo for their Armored Core. Earning money meant buying better parts, but failing a mission meantlosingmoney. Going into debt by at least 50,000 credits would trigger Human PLUS, restarting the game while upgrading the player’s character by meshing them cybernetically with their Armored Core. Sure, you lost some of your humanity, but you improved your shoulder-mounted weapon performance in the process.
These upgrades were quite significant, and made it easier for players to complete the game. Even better, when you bought the sequelsProject PhantasmaandMaster of Arena, you could import your save and bring along your arsenal and your Human PLUS upgrades into what were considered tougher games. Or at least youcouldon the original PlayStation. Currently, the versions in the PlayStation Plus Classics Catalog cannot import game saves from one another.
According to Forbes, the developer of these ports, Implicit Conversions, appears to be aware of the issue and will hopefully provide a patch in the future. Some special parts that should only have been accessible inProject Phantasmavia the save import feature were found in the game’s shop, meaning the developer must have been aware that these parts wouldn’t have otherwise been accessible. However, not all of these special parts are for sale, and there’s still no way to get the Human PLUS upgrades in that game orMaster of Arena.
While I hope a patch makes it possible to import saves in the future,Armored Coreis still absolutely worth playing for any curious PlayStation Plus subscribers. Here’s hoping we get the other 12 games in the franchise a little sooner."
Atomfall is an achievement in cutting to the chase,2025-03-28T21:43:40Z,https://www.polygon.com/opinion/548988/atomfall-opening-rebellion-pc-xbox-ps5,"Rebellion’s stealth game demands you walk boldly out into the unknown
byMatt Patches
Rebellion’s stealth game demands you walk boldly out into the unknown
byMatt Patches
Forget the number of hours it takes for a game to “get good” — how am I spending the first15 minutes?
Call me impatient, but a game’s opening seconds, even those introductory moments as a character comes alive or a world opens up, are make-or-break for how far I am willing to soldier on into what could be 20, 30, or 100 hours of play. So what a relief it was to fire upAtomfall, the new stealth-driven survival adventure from Sniper Elite developer Rebellion now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox (via Game Pass), and feel immediately dunked into its radioactive mystery.
Atomfalltakes place in an alt-universe patch of northwestern Englandwhere a nuclear disaster has left buildings crumbled and society torn apart. There are paramilitaries operating walled-off towns and pagan cults stalking the open fields. A dash of retrofuture machinery gives the backdrop a Fallout flavor (intentional), while the mannerisms and encounters are delightfully British (“press X to pour tea”). There’s lots to discover, and enough jank to the physics to build an aura of danger — in “the zone,” you’re in the wild.
None of this is spelled out when your first-person avatar wakes up confused, underground, and faced with a decision to help or hurt an ailing doctor who dangles the first of the game’s many mysteries in front of you. You grab a backpack and a few supplies and rush out the door into the devastated but sunny Cumberland countryside, with only a few breadcrumbs scattered to let you know where to go next. My first time booting upAtomfallwas at 11 p.m. on a weary Wednesday night; I was terrified by the stillness of the land and thrilled to decide in which direction to run. For all its Fallout andSTALKERconnections,Mystcame to mind more than once.
Not too long before jumping intoAtomfall, I trudged through the opening hours ofAssassin’s Creed Shadows, the definition of the AAA open-world experience that offers so much at the end of the tunnel.A long, long, long tunnel. Dozens of foundational cutscenes aside, my initial time withShadowsfelt like booking a trip to Disney World then immediately beelining to the monorail. Even the tutorial-fueled cold open ofShadows, which finds up-and-coming samurai Yasuke plowing through baddies, felt so on rails as to grind my interest to a halt. Not every game needs a mystery to propel it forward (thoughShadowskinda has one), and I welcome a guided tutorial to intricate systems that will soon replace family birthdays and login passwords in my memory. ButShadows’ first two hours of play lacked the flicker of immediacy. After I adjust brightness and calibrate controls and shuffle through character creation options, I want to accomplish something right away — something more than just pressing buttons.
Instead of a preface laying out the whos and whats and wheres,Atomfall’s opening demands investigation. At first, the only clues are in the scenery — an ethereal light beaming from behind nuclear cooling towers, scintillating against the moorland like the Shimmer inAnnihilation— and a few hints from the doctor that suggest a direction. Typical on-screen prompts explain crafting, combat, and stealth, but knowing how the systems work inAtomfallrequires some experimentation. What’s worth making room for in your inventory? Live a little, and you’ll figure it out. How do you survive a spat with a local outlaw? Pray to god the cricket bat you just picked up is a decent weapon. How do you successfully trespass through a military encampment without tipping off the guards? That streammightmuffle your steps. Maybe.
Atomfall’s investigations leave a similar curiosity gap, relying on clues and coordinates to get you to the next milestone moment instead of obvious map landmarks. It’s not anotebook game, but I felt in total control of where my detective brain wanted to go next — or didn’t. There are a number of bunkers and other dimly lit death traps scattered around the hills of the radiation zone, and early on, when I felt bold enough to flick on my torch (or as the non-Brits say, flashlight), I descended down to ultimately meet my demise. The nuclear fallout has not been kind to every local.
I have many more hours to go inAtomfall, but it’s a relief that it didn’t take even an hour to feel absorbed by Rebellion’s pitch. The setup kicked me out the door. The gameplay dropped me into the unknown. Without a clue, I started walking. Having broken into a mine haunted by shadowy figures, hit the gate of a compound that may unlock the secrets of this disaster, met a vicar who begged me to keep a discovered murder a secret… I want to keep digging.
Rebellion is right to say thatAtomfallis“AA punching up.”The game is modest in size, but the scope seems to have created greater urgency in the pacing. Games of much smaller scale — a retro platformer, a pixel life sim — also ask you to hit start and learn as you go. There are AAA games with similar immediacy (Baldur’s Gate 3comes to mind), but many more that prioritize graphical polish and the vastness of their mechanics before getting around to the reason we all showed up.
Atomfalllands between the two for me, thanks to genre and a simple bit of cinema logic: show, don’t tell. If you see a door, you’ll run to it. Then you’ll keep running. You’ll figure out the rest — or die trying.
Atomfallis out now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

The new game releases this week waver between horrifying and charming. Sometimes the premise of a game is pretty sad on its face, but the stuff you do isn’t as bleak. That’s the case for a couple games arriving this week. However, that’s not true forThe Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, a game fully committed to misery. There are cheerful moments in it, though, so it technically counts. Just don’t go into it expecting to spend 40 hours riffing on Ellie’s guitar.
Koiradrops just before the rest of the games on the list arrive on Thursday. It’s a game about exploring a forest with a lost puppy, and if I think too hard about where that story might go I’ll cry. Then there’s Naughty Dog’s bleak, post-apocalyptic shooter where you can’t go 45 minutes without watching something awful happen.Sandalso comes out on that day and brings a fun twist to the extraction shooter genre: spider tanks. AndCaligoandSephiriaare two games that look more pleasant than they actually are. One of them lets you play as a bunny warrior, though.
Here are our most anticipated game releases for the week of March 31.
Release date:April 1Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PCThis little adventure game is for dog lovers. Your character finds a puppy and goes on an adventure in a magical, musical forest. It’s like a single-player co-op game as you solve puzzles and work together to find home.
Release date:April 3Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PCJust in time for theHBO show’s second season,The Last of Us Part 2is finally coming to PC. This version will have improved graphics, the No Return roguelike mode, and a whole developer commentary mode to learn how the game was made.
Release date:April 3Platforms:Windows PCMuch likeRust,Sandis another survival game with a straightforward title. OK, it’s more than that: It’s also an extraction shooter where everyone drives weird spider tanks. Basically, the game looks like Mad Max with rocket launchers.
Release date:April 3Platforms:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis dreamlike walking simulator is coming to consoles this week. This game has a variety of places to explore, like pretty fantasy forests and hellish nightmare worlds. This is a game full of surprises.
Release date:April 3Platforms:Windows PCYou’re a bunny in a pixel world of animals, artifacts, and roguelike action. This early access game is all about finding gear and equipping yourself to protect the other animals of the land. And even though it’s not finished yet, it already has four levels and over 250 items to find.

The big questions going into the Switch 2 reveal,2025-03-28T18:30:59Z,https://www.polygon.com/analysis/548500/nintendo-switch-2-questions-before-reveal,"Nintendo’s full reveal will hopefully answer all of these unknowns
byMichael McWhertor
This story was first published in Switchboard, a newsletter from Polygon that delivers all the latest Switch 2 news, reporting, and rumors directly to your inbox.Sign up hereto get it weekly.
This time next week, we’ll know a lot more about theNintendo Switch 2. A newNintendo Direct showcasededicated to the top-secret handheld console will air on the morning of Wednesday, April 2. That presentation will offer a first look at new games, hardware details, and hopefully much more.
Ahead of the event, we have a long list of questions that Nintendo still needs to answer. Here are some of the biggest unknowns about Switch 2.
Some of the biggest questions we’re hoping will be addressed during the Nintendo Direct surround the new Joy-Con controllers. Will they have Hall effect joysticks, as previously reported? And does that mean stick drift is a thing of the past?
How will the rumoredmouse control features of the Joy-Conswork? More crucially, do Joy-Cons actually feel good as mice? Are players going to need a dedicated mousing surface, or will a coffee tabletop or couch surface suffice?
Importantly, how do the new, larger Joy-Cons feel in the hand? Will those bigger shoulder buttons work as well as we’d hoped? And what does thatnew “C” button on the right Joy-Condo?
The Switch’s Joy-Cons were a pretty radical reinvention for game controllers, both revolutionary and quite flawed. That’s why the full reveal of the Joy-Con (2.0) controllers will be so fascinating to watch, to see how Nintendo moves its design forward and fixes the original version’s shortcomings.
Officially, we only know of one Nintendo-developed game coming to Switch 2 at this point: a new Mario Kart game. But Nintendo has reportedly been building up a strong library of internally developed Switch 2 games, and while we have some ideas about which dev teams could be working on which franchises, Nintendo is excellent at keeping secrets and delivering surprises.
Arecurrent-gen Switch games being developed with Switch 2 in mind, meaning will they support higher resolutions and improved frame rates? (Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Editionmay have already answered this question.)
Frankly, I think we’re all wondering which Nintendo franchises will show up during the Switch 2’s first year. Will Nintendo have a new 2D or 3D Mario ready for launch?
Beyond franchises, perhaps the most exciting thing yet to be revealed is the Switch 2’s equivalent ofWii Sports,Nintendo Land, and1-2-Switch— a game or games that will show what the new system is capable of and what differentiates it from the original Switch.
Which third parties will show up for Switch 2? And how strongly? Both Microsoft and Ubisoft seem ready to step in and support Switch 2 with a long line of AAA games that couldn’t fit on a Switch, but seem like a perfect fit for Switch 2.
Microsoft has publicly voiced interest in Switch 2, meaning franchises like Halo, Call of Duty, Forza, and Fallout could make a strong showing on Nintendo’s new console. If Microsoft does fully embrace Switch 2, it could be a windfall not just for the Xbox maker, but for Nintendo fans, who will have a big, broad range of very good franchises to play on their new systems.
Ubisoft is a longtime supporter of Nintendo consoles out of the gate, and it has a back catalog of Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy games from the past decade it could repackage for the new and more powerful Nintendo handheld. Other publishers like Sega, Capcom, and Electronic Arts could follow with remasters and rereleases. Suffice it to say, AAA game makers have a potentially big new revenue stream with Switch 2, and I expect owners of the new system to be flush with choice.
That smorgasbord also includes indie games. Nintendo has shown strong support for independent game developers during the Switch era, with dedicated Indie World showcases, which I expect will continue on Switch 2. Are Switch indie devs like Team Cherry and Supergiant Games ready to drop their long-awaited sequels on Switch 2?
A late spring/early summer release for Switch 2 is looking more and more likely, based on the timing of Nintendo’s hands-on events for the console and Polygon’s own sources. We’ve heard that an early June launch is planned.
If that’s the case, a firm date should be announced at April’s Nintendo Direct. June is just two months away; retailers will need time to get up to speed and customers will need to get pre-orders in for Switch 2’s launch.
A bigger unknown, and one that feels a little fluid at this point, is price. While $399 seems like the sweet spot for Switch 2, a weak yen, fluctuating component costs, and price uncertainty related to tariffs threatened by the Trump administration could have an impact on Nintendo’s pricing decisions. Some analysts arepredicting a potentially higher price— upward of $499 — and if that’s the case, there will be one more question that’s yet to be answered: Will Switch 1 owners pay that much?

Nintendo suggests there will be enhanced Switch 2 versions of some Switch games,2025-03-28T13:24:25Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/548599/nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-enhanced-upgrades,"Small print for Virtual Game Cards mentions ‘Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games’

In the small print ofan explainerabout its newVirtual Game Cardsystem for digital purchases, Nintendo appeared to confirm that some Switch games will get enhanced versions forSwitch 2— or at any rate, versions native to the Switch 2 console.
A footnote to the article reads, “Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system.” The note also implies that the Switch 2 will use the Virtual Game Card system as well, and will be able to exchange Switch 1 games with an original Switch.
The Switch 2 is confirmed to be fully backward compatible with its predecessor’s software, so it will be able to play (almost) any Switch game regardless. But Nintendo’s mention of “Switch 2 Edition games,” as opposed to “Switch 2 exclusive games,” suggests that some Switch games will get cross-gen versions that run natively on Switch 2 rather than through the backward-compatibility layer.
This opens the door to enhanced versions of back-catalog titles, such asThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, as well as upcoming Switch releases likeMetroid Prime 4: Beyond. It’s an expected move that has been made commonplace by the latest generations of PlayStation and Xbox consoles. But it’s still the first indication from Nintendo that it will go down this route for cross-gen releases.
It remains to be seen whether Nintendo will charge extra for Switch 2 Edition games. Sony did so for some PlayStation 5 upgrades of PlayStation 4 titles, while Microsoft elected to offer what it called Xbox Series X Enhanced versions of Xbox One games for free.
How the Switch 2 handles backward compatibility, and any potential performance enhancements for older games, is one of the bigger questions about the system ahead of itsfull reveal on April 2. This fine print answers one of our questions about it, but many more remain.

Game of the Year 2025 predictions: The front-runners and challengers to come,2025-03-27T21:22:23Z,https://www.polygon.com/awards/546327/game-of-the-year-game-awards-2025-frontrunners,"What’s in pole position for gaming’s top prize? Let’s make some predictions
byOli Welsh
The 11th Game Awards, scheduled for Dec. 11, will come at the end of a watershed year for gaming that will see the launches ofNintendo Switch 2and (in theory)Grand Theft Auto 6. Both of those releases will likely loom large over theGame of the Yearcompetition at the leading awards ceremony for the game industry — the Oscars of gaming, as it were. But they are not the whole story. Even the first few months of 2025 have seen a number of surprisingly strong GOTY contenders come to light.
The Game Awards’ voting bodyis composed of a wide range of international games media (Polygon included), with a 10% contribution from fan voting. There area number of strong indicatorsfor what will perform well in the Game of the Year category. A high Metacritic rating (preferably over 90) is a must; role-playing games and action-adventures are strongly favored, as are games with strong narrative elements; indie and multiplayer games struggle harder for recognition than AAA single-player adventures. We used these metrics to correctly predict last year’s winner,Astro Bot. (We also got four of the six nominees right, and correctly called 14 other categories.)
Below, you’ll find our predictions for the most likely nominees, of which there are six each year, for Game of the Year 2025. Unlike the film industry, where most titles are known quantities well in advance, you never really know what kind of impact a video game will have, or how good it will be, until it’s out. With that in mind, this list only includes games that are already out. We’ll update these rankings throughout the year as new games are released. We’ll also list some likely upcoming contenders, and in future updates, we’ll predict some of the 2025 GOTY race’s dark horses, too.
Why it could win:Critical consensus is still the most reliable indicator of success at The Game Awards, and as the only game released so far this year with a rating over 90 on both Metacritic and OpenCritic, Hazelight’s co-op adventure is the clear front-runner in this regard. It’s got a legacy advantage, too: Hazelight’s previous game,It Takes Two, won GOTY in 2021, and since then has amassed amassive popular following. As a story-led action-adventure,Split Fictionalso belongs to a genre that the Game Awards jury has been known to favor in the past.
Weaknesses:PerhapsIt Takes Two’s win will count against it if jury members are looking for something different to reward. Also, whileIt Takes Two’s intensely personal story about divorce was unquestionably a strength,Split Fictionhas been praised more for its design than its abstract and overworked tale of writers adrift in virtual reality.
Why it could win:This could bethis year’sBlack Myth: Wukong: an ambitious hit game from a developer operating outside the gaming establishment, delivering on core gamers’ ardent desire for massive solo adventures made without compromise.Deliverance 2is a realistic medieval RPG with strong storytelling, and critics really liked it (its Metascore is 88). Another similar game might be the 2015 GOTY winner,The Witcher 3. This is right in The Game Awards’ sweet spot.
Weaknesses:Black Myth: Wukongdidn’t win GOTY— much to its producer’s chagrin. Just likeBlack Myth’s Game Science, Kingdom Come developer Warhorse is considered politically radioactive by some, after founder Daniel Vávra madepro-Gamergate commentsin 2015. Perhaps more to the point, the game is a challenging time sink that isn’t that broadly played among journalists and jurors, despite respectable sales.
Why it could win:Monster Hunter’s steady climb from co-op curio, through handheld sensation, to AAA champion climaxed with the huge sales and glowing reviews ofWilds. It’s slick, it’s gorgeous, and it’s sanded off Monster Hunter’s rough edges. (As a rule, the Game Awards jury isn’t keen on rough edges.)
Weaknesses:AlthoughWildsgestures toward a more conventional RPG storytelling style than previous Monster Hunters, this is still a deeply systemic game in which the equipment grind matters way more than players’ personal investment in the characters, and that’s not The Game Awards’ favorite look for a GOTY winner.
Why it could win:It only missed the deadline for the 2024 awards by a week or two, but MachineGames’ take on the indelible movie hero was swiftly acclaimed for all the things the jury likes to see: strong, performance-led storytelling, polished tech, high production values, a good mix of action and more cerebral play, and Troy Baker. It would almost certainly have been nominated for a GOTY 2024, and April’s PlayStation 5 release will be a big help in keepingGreat Circlein the conversation all the way up until the 2025 nomination process begins.
Weaknesses:PS5 release notwithstanding, 12 months is anawfullylong time to stay relevant in the race. The Game Awards do not typically reward licensed games. And the mid-80s Metacritic and OpenCritic scores are good, but indicate the critical consensus on this game is a little softer than it first appeared.
Why it could win:Obsidian Games’ traditional fantasy RPG is an interesting case. Its initial critical reception was on the soft side, but it has had a long tail and strong word of mouth, as players found its dependable, old-fashioned qualities — satisfying combat, excellent writing, and moreish loot — tough to turn away from. Genre-wise, as an undemanding and strongly narrative-focused RPG, it’s in a Game Awards sweet spot.Avowedis definitely undervalued, and though it will probably get pushed out of the likely nominees over the course of the year, it’s the definition of a dark horse.
Weaknesses:It would be very, very surprising for a game with a mere 80 Metascore to get nominated for Game of the Year. Surprising, but not unprecedented:Black Myth: Wukongmanaged it with an 81 Metascorelast year.
Why it could win:It might not be enough to save Ubisoft, but the whole gaming community heaved a sigh of relief when the first major Assassin’s Creed in four and a half years turned out to be good. This is AAA open-world gaming done right, with lavish production values and memorable characters.
Weaknesses:For whatever reason, the Game Awards jury is not that keen on Assassin’s Creed. 2018’sOdysseyis the only game in the series to score a Game of the Year nomination, and though it was nominated in four categories, it won none. Perhaps, like Call of Duty, the series’ heavily commercialized ubiquity is seen as a disqualifier by the judges.Shadows’ 81 Metascore is certainly too low to buck that trend.
Grant Theft Auto 6:It’s been such a long time since there was a mainline Grand Theft Auto game that The Game Awards weren’t around whenGTA 5was released. It’shard to see anything beating Rockstar’s behemoth— if, and it’s a big if, it makes its 2025 release date.
Metroid Prime 4: Beyond:Nintendo may well have multiple GOTY contenders in Switch 2’s release year, but the only one we know about for sure is Retro Studios’ very long-awaited return to the first-person sci-fi adventures of Samus.
Hades 2:Assuming it emerges from early access this year, Supergiant’s roguelike sequel will likely be leading the indie contenders for the year — out to avenge the original game’s perceived snub at the 2020 awards. (It’s eligible regardless, but the jury prefers not to nominate early access games.)
Death Stranding 2:Hideo Kojima is a Game Awards favorite and the originalDeath Strandingcontended strongly in 2019, although it ultimately lost toSekiro.Death Strandingwas divisive at the time, but in the years since, multiple rereleases have helped players get their heads around this singular vision, and with PlayStation’s full muscle behind it, the sequel is sure to make a big splash.
Ghost of Yōtei:No publisher has a better record at the Game Awards than Sony, and its other contender this year is this open-world samurai adventure — again, a sequel to a game (Ghost of Tsushima) whose reputation has only grown over time. If nothing else, this more rarefied, bespoke-feeling release will probably edge out the similarly themedAssassin’s Creed Shadows.
South of Midnight:The Game Awards jury is sure to love the culturally specific, character-forward storytelling of Compulsion Games’ occult adventure in the Deep South, which likely stands in for a delayedFable(and potentially replacesIndiana Jones) as Xbox Game Studios’ most likely contender. But its gameplay is an unknown quantity, and Compulsion’s record is a little patchy.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows has a secret weapon that completely breaks the game,2025-03-26T21:28:35Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/547305/assassins-creed-shadows-secret-weapon-perk-break-the-game,"Can’t get hit if you move faster than everyone else
byTyler Colp
Assassin’s Creed Shadowshas a weapon that breaks the whole idea of being a ninja, and thus the entire point of the game. With it, you can turn Naoe into an unkillable brawler that would make Yasuke hang up his sword. It’s so powerful that I’m pretty sure Ubisoft will remove it in a patch, so you should take advantage of it as soon as you can.
The best part? You can grab this weapon in Izumi Settsu, the region that the game starts you off in (shout-out to YouTube userJorRaptorfor highlighting it). A little north of your hideout, there’s a small camp called Tozuku’s Lair. The viewpoint in the Katano Foothills is nearby if you already have that unlocked. The camp has a few enemies to clear out first, and then you can loot the chest for a legendarytantocalled Igan Sunset.
Don’t worry about the stats on the Igan Sunset; just look at that legendary perk engraved on it. Whenever you use the unique Escape Strike tanto ability, time will slow to a crawl. It might not sound very useful, but trust me when I say it might ruin the game for you.
To use the Escape Strike ability, you need to unlock it on the tanto skill tree. The problem is that it’s only available on the second tier of unlocks, which requires you to gather up enoughknowledge pointsfirst. Hit up the orange icons (often hidden behind white question marks) on your map to collect these. I’d aim for simple ones like Shrines, Temples, and Kofun to save yourself some time. When you have enough, use twomastery pointsto unlock Leap Strike, and one mastery point to unlock Escape Strike.
Congratulations: You’re now effectively immortal! When you enter combat with your tanto out, you can hold R1 or R2 (right bumper or right trigger on Xbox) and press circle (B on Xbox) to dodge backward and trigger slow-mo. If an enemy tries to attack you, you can simply step out of the way and do another Escape Strike. And because you can also Leap Strike — which requires the same button combination while you hold your analog stick in a direction — you can freely ping-pong between enemies until they’re dead.
I’m pretty sure that if the Assassins knew about this technique, their long war with the Templars would’ve been over quick. Be warned, though: Those cursed with this knowledge will find it really hard to patiently sneak around as Naoe when they know they can’t be touched in a fight. I haven’t finished the game, but I have yet to find anything that can actually hurt me during battle. Just be sure toupgrade your hideout’s Forgeso you can engrave the Igan Sunset’s perk onto better tantos.
This is the kind of tactic I’d probably recommend avoiding until you’re ready to fully trivialize the whole game, or if you really like playing Yasuke as the primary brawler of the two. Part of the fun of playing Naoe is methodically clearing out a camp until only the big enemies remain and you can pounce on them from the shadows. I’ve only brought out the tanto when things have gone awry, but I won’t judge you for wanting to speed up Naoe’s revenge story with a little time magic.

With so many games available at our fingertips — or in our backlogs — it’s sometimes hard to know what games are worth our time. Figuring out where to spend our precious free time can feel daunting, especially with more things vying for our attention. And if you’re busy with jobs, family, or other obligations, that free time shrinks even more.
But Polygon is here to help. Well, actually, this week I’m here to help. During our weekly open thread, everyone is welcome to comment to ask for tailored game recommendations. Want a long game to escape into this spring? Or some way to test out a new genre you’re interested in exploring? Or a game perfect for chatting while playing on Discord? I’ll do my best to make recommendations no matter what you throw at me — and I’m sure other commenters will too.
How will this work? From 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. EDT, I’ll be in the comments responding to anyone looking for game recommendations. If you’re looking for one, please share as much info about what you’re looking for as you can, including about what platforms you own or if you have a subscription service likeXbox Game Pass.
But there are a lot of games out there, and while I’ve dabbled in many genres, I’ll narrow the field down a little. I play a lot of multiplayer games, both cooperative and competitive. I have a shameful amount of hours banked inLeague of Legends,Overwatch, andMarvel Rivals. I also enjoy exploring vast worlds with my friends, whether that be through a multiplayer match ofStellaris, a rollicking round ofSea of Thieves, or the long-term effort of aValheimserver.
When I’m not feeling particularly social, I also enjoy a wealth of single-player games. They fit into two categories: huge, sprawling RPGs likeCyberpunk 2077orKingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and I also love weird little horror games and indie experiences that you can knock out in an hour or two likeArctic Eggs,The Beginner’s Guide, orI Am Your Beast.
Three bonus ingredients that will spice a game up for me are (1) a robust dolly dress-up system, (2) deep lore, and (3) weird humor.
So, what would you like to play next? Leave a comment below and I’ll do my best to find your next favorite game.

The 5 best cleaning games,2025-03-26T21:18:14Z,https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/547346/best-cleaning-video-games-cozy-house-flipper-unpacking,"From House Flipper 2 to Crime Scene Cleaner, these are the best of the best

Spring is here, and that means it’s time for spring cleaning! No, I’m not referring to my actual home, which I guess I’m also going to clean at some point, but we aren’t going to discuss that today. I am referring, of course, to the far more soothing experience of cleaning up a virtual space in a video game. There’s just nothing quite like the sensation of moving a mop icon on top of a digital dirt pile and clicking, clicking, clicking until it all disappears. If real-life mopping were that satisfying and simple, maybe I would actually do it (instead I own thisrobot mop, which isgreat, but again, that’s not why we’re here).
You might not know it, given how often I talk aboutmy love ofElden Ringorparrying inDark Souls, but cleaning games are one of my favorite video game genres — the perfect counterpoint to a tough FromSoftware title, if I may say so. Also the perfect end to a tiring real-life day! The five games on this list have seriously soothed my brain, and now I pass them on to all of you.
Where to play:PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Windows PCDespite the title,House Flipper 2(and its predecessor,House Flipper) is not so much about flipping properties for resale as it is about doing miscellaneous cleanup jobs in a small town. Beyond brief email correspondence and cellphone calls with your boss, you never really need to interact with anybody in-game; you just go to various locations and use different cleaning implements and power tools to make total shitheaps into sparkling-clean, move-in-ready living spaces. You earn digital currency as you go, so you can unlock more tools to work even faster, but take it slow — every mission is a meditative experience worth treasuring.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Windows PCThe title of this game makes it sound like you might be some sort of official crime scene cleaner for a police department, but nope. You’re playing as a civilian who needs cash badly to help his sick daughter with expensive medical treatments, and you end up working for the mob to clean up crimes. It’s lucrative, OK? Despite the grisly title and dark premise,Crime Scene Cleaneris absolutely a comedy game, with the protagonist constantly delivering sarcastic one-liners about his predicament. Plus, the crimes requiring cleanup have often unfolded in bizarre and fun locations to explore, such as a museum filled with dinosaurs’ remains… and now, human ones.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Mac, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox OneAt first,Unpackingseems like a charming little experience in which you do the titular activity that no one enjoys doing in real life but that feels strangely satisfying in this game, perhaps due to the cute interior designs and animation style on display. Over time, though, you’ll realize there’s a story here of a specific person moving from place to place and living an entire life, reflected in the things they need to unpack at each one. The result is poignant and sweet.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Mac, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XDepending on what type of brain you have,A Little to the Left’s cleaning-oriented puzzles will either leave you frustrated or extremely satisfied… or both. This game isn’t so much about clicking on messes to make them disappear; instead it’s a series of hyper-specific object-based puzzles, most of which involve simply straightening things up. Others are more like aesthetic mind games that require you to figure out an ideal orientation for a certain set of objects (should they be ordered by size, by color, by shape…?). I couldn’t always tell what each puzzle required me to do, but for most of them, it was obvious enough and gave me the nice brain buzz when I figured it out. You can skip any puzzle you get stuck on, thank goodness.
Where to play:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XThe cleaning game to beat all cleaning games,PowerWash Simulatoris also an incredible advertisement for power washers, which are actually as fun in real life as they are in this game. Real life doesn’t have the fun crossovers that this game does, though, where you get to clean up Lara Croft’s messy mansion or Shrek’s swamp. More and more DLC packs keep on getting released, soPowerWash Simis truly the gift that keeps on giving for fans of this genre.

Cristiano Ronaldo is playable in Fatal Fury because reality wasn’t absurd enough already,2025-03-26T19:31:06Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/547300/cristiano-ronaldo-fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-snk,"And you thought Lebron James in Multiversus was the wildest fighting games could get
byIan Walker
They actually did it. After teasinga mysterious collaborationwith Cristiano Ronaldo last year, SNK has announced the soccer player will be, not just a skin or promotional spokesperson, but a playable character in the upcomingFatal Fury: City of the Wolves. The fighting game launches in April.
Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of history’s greatest – and most controversial, due to multiple rape accusations made against him over the years — soccer players, both at the club level on teams like Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus, and internationally with the Portugal national football team. While odd on paper, his appearance inFatal Fury: City of the Wolvescan likely be attributed to his popularity in Saudi Arabia playing for the Al-Nassr football club since 2023, as SNK is currently owned by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s non-profit MiSK Foundation.
Ronaldo has also been known in recent years for arape allegationthat was first made public in 2017 when German website Der Spiegel published asettlementbetween the soccer player and an accuser who claimed Ronaldo raped her in Las Vegas in 2009. Ronaldo reportedly paid the woman a sum of $375,000 for signing a non-disclosure agreement.
The victim filed a civil lawsuit against Ronaldo in Nevada in 2018, charging the athlete’s team with violating the previous confidentiality agreement by denying the allegations publicly following the Der Spiegel report and requesting $25 million in damages. Her case wasdismissedin 2022 due to “bad-faith conduct” by her attorney, and a subsequent appeal wasdeniedthe following year.
Fatal Fury: City of the Wolvesis the first new entry in the pre-King of Fighters series in almost 25 years. Other playable characters include Andy Bogard, Mai Shiranui, and Joe Higashi as well as crossover appearances from Street Fighter cast members Chun-Li and Ken Masters. It launches on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on April 24.

Don’t expect The Witcher 4 until 2027 at the earliest,2025-03-26T16:46:00Z,https://www.polygon.com/the-witcher/547069/witcher-4-release-date-2026-2027-cd-projekt,"Maybe if we don’t think about it, the time will go by faster
byIan Walker
Tucked in amongst a lot of dry business talk about sales milestones and long-term perspectives, CD Projektrecently confirmedto investorsThe Witcher 4won’t be released by 2026, pushing its potential launch window into the unimaginably far-off year of 2027 and beyond.
“Even though we do not plan to releaseThe Witcher 4by the end of 2026, we are still driven by this financial goal,” CD Projekt chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz said, referring to the company’s stated ambitions of pulling in a net profit of 2 billion złoty (around $515 million USD) from 2023 to 2026.
The Witcher 4wasfirst revealedsans release date atThe Game Awards 2024. A lengthy cinematic trailer depicted side characterCiri taking over as the series’ playable protagonistin place of long-time series face Geralt of Rivia.
“We’re kicking off a brand-new Witcher saga, this time with Ciri as the heart of the story!” game directorSebastian Kalemba said at the time. “It feels so good to finally be able to say those words — for the longest time we knew that we wanted Ciri to be the protagonist ofThe Witcher 4; it just felt natural to us and we believe that Ciri deserves it. In this game we want to explore what it means to truly become a witcher by following Ciri on her Path. This trailer is a taste of both that, and just how dark and grounded the world of The Witcher can be.”
The first entry ina new trilogy,The Witcher 4is one of three Witcher projects currently in development, a group that also includes a remake of the franchise’s 2007 debut and a multiplayer-inclusive project codenamed Sirius at Boston-based subsidiary The Molasses Flood.
Rumors indicate Microsoft is alsotargeting 2027for its follow-up to the Xbox Series X/S, which means fans may have to wait for a whole new console generation to roll around to get their hands on the long-awaited Witcher sequel.

"Starcraft miniatures game lets you play as Terran, Zerg, or Protoss",2025-03-26T14:24:57Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/546893/starcraft-tabletop-miniatures-game-announcement-release-date-price,"Hell, it’s about time
byCharlie Hall
StarCraft, the classic real-time strategy game created by Blizzard Entertainment, is being turned into a miniatures game. Polish game publisher and plastics manufacturer Archon Studio madethe announcementearly Wednesday morning in a blog post, pegging the initial release for 2026. A series of board games set in the same universe is said to follow in 2027. More information is expected in a livestream presentation on April 3.
Originally released in 1998,StarCrafttells the story of the unending battle between the gritty Terran military, the high-tech Protoss, and the unrelenting hordes of the Zerg. Its outsized success cast the die for a generation of real-time strategy hits, and even helped to popularize the concept of esports. The game lives on, including on Xbox Game Pass for PC which includes access to bothStarCraft: RemasteredandStarCraft 2Campaign Collection.
Archon Studio burst onto the tabletop scene in 2019 with a successful campaign for hard-plastic terrain for dungeon crawling, tabletop role-play, and other applications. CalledDungeons & Lasers, the campaign raised the flag for what was at the time Europe’s only high-level competitor to Games Workshop, the tabletop juggernaut based in the United Kingdom. The studio has gone on to forge partnerships across the video game industry, producing successful campaigns for games likeWolfenstein: The Board GameandMaster of Orion: Ad Astra. It’s also turning heads with its remarkable pre-painted plastic products calledPrismacast, bits of plastic kit delivered on the sprue that look unlike anything we’ve seen on the market so far.
Nothing was revealed about the nature or the scale of the game itself. Archon Studio has scheduled a livestream for April 3 where more information will be provided.

The Nintendo Switch traumatized my family and I cannot forgive it,2025-03-25T22:00:25Z,https://www.polygon.com/opinion/543105/the-nintendo-switch-traumatized-my-family-and-i-cannot-forgive-it,"﻿If I have to buy another fucking Joy-Con, I’m going to scream
byCharlie Hall
Halfway through October 2021, my youngest daughter, just 7 years old at the time, came to me with concern in her eyes. TheNintendo Switchwouldn’t turn on, and its last few moments of operation were concerning. Something about a download that had just completed, she said, and a button that said “update.” That was the end of the line for that particular unit, but only the beginning of my troubles with a console that would proceed to try my patience until this very day — an experience that makes me loath to considerbuying the Nintendo Switch 2.
The Hall family had been victim to a technical snafu as old as mobile devices themselves: the dreaded low-power firmware update. That’s when a device, like an iPhone or a graphics card or a $250 red-and-black plastic hunk of shit, loses power while it’s upgrading its most important layer of software. Firmware refers to the pieces of code that tell a device that it’s a device and not a 398-gram brick, and as I took the tripartite console from my daughter’s tiny little hands — where it was cradled like a dead bird — I knew that it was a total loss. But that wasn’t the worst part.
Inside that black mirror of despair were dozens of tiny, furry neighbors — herdigital friends fromAnimal Crossing: New Horizons. The newisland backupfeature had only recently been introduced, and her idiot father hadn’t yet taken the time to perform the arcane rites required to save a Nintendo Switch game to the cloud.
Her friends were all dead, of that I was sure. So, too, was the bell-selling knickknack shop that she and her older sister had built from scratch before showing it off on the Polygon Twitch channel. My house, my wife’s house, thosedamnable ladders and bridges that took weeks to build, and, of course, the peach trees that we all loved so much… none of them were ever coming back.
Ultimately, it’s my fault. I’m the user here, and it was my error. But I get to beangry at Nintendofor not making something like backing up hundreds of hours of irretrievable gameplay, shared joyfully during the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, just a little bit easier, or — dare I say it — a feature that gets turned on automatically from the start.
Everything about the Switch is a quirk, and some of them are more obnoxious than others
But Nintendo doesn’t treat the cloud like other console manufacturers do. It doesn’t treat online storefronts like other console manufacturers do, either. Or onboard storage. Or game cartridges. Or online multiplayer. Or friends lists. Or televisions, for that matter. Everything about the Switch is a quirk, and some of them are more obnoxious than others.
While having our original Nintendo Switch replaced by a refurbished one set me back pert near $120, I’ve easily spent at least that much buying additional controllers over the years. Both of the Joy-Cons that shipped with our original Switch suffered fromJoy-Con drift, something that my children suffered through wordlessly for months before I realized it.
“What is happening to Mario?” I asked one day while watching the girls play in the basement.
“Oh, that’s just how the controllers work now,” said my oldest. I was incredulous. There is no scenario where I would accept anything other than absolute obeisance from a human input device, but here my kids were making do, trying to complete nefarious jumping puzzles with a joystick that was barely capable of walking a virtual avatar in a straight line. Suffice it to say that they eventually lost the taste for piloting the tiny red plumber — especially when it took the better part of two months to get our controllers back after being repaired under the warranty.
When the next two broke, I just threw them away. It wasn’t even worth a trip to the post office for me.
Today we’re in a better place, thanks. The girls both have healthy relationships with video game consoles like the Xbox Series X, with iPhones and iPads, and with Windows PCs, as well as a catalog of games that each of them can call home. But they remain literally afraid of the Nintendo Switch, a console that let them down multiple times for various reasons. I can’t even coax them to bring it along for road trips.
They won’t forget that experience, and I won’t either. And that’s why I’m waving off the Nintendo Switch 2. I’ve got enough to worry about in the year of our lord 2025 that risking a visitation from another wonky portable console isn’t even on my radar.

Sunderfolk, the ambitious co-op tactical adventure game built on a love of tabletop games, is coming to consoles and PC on April 23, developer Secret Door and publisher Dreamhaven announced Tuesday. Curious players can try outSunderfolkwith a first look demo through Nvidia’s GeForce Now game-streaming service from March 25 through April 7.
Secret Door’s debut title is inspired by tabletop games likeGloomhavenand Dungeons & Dragons, and uses smart devices as a controller, à la Jackbox games.Sunderfolkis designed to be played by one to four players on a large TV screen or monitor, with the game itself running on a PC or console. Players interact with the game throughSunderfolk’s dedicated controller app, which will be free to download for Android and iOS devices.
Sunderfolk’s creators hope their game will bring players together by bypassing the complexity and setup times required for learning new tabletop games. “Our goal withSunderfolkis to leverage modern technology tomake game night something everyone can enjoy,” said Chris Sigaty, studio head of Secret Door and veteran of StarCraft and Warcraft game development.
InSunderfolk, players choose from one of six anthropomorphic heroes: an Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, or Rogue. Each character has their own strategic role and passive ability, and can be customized with weapons, armor, trinkets, and skills. Character abilities are represented by cards; players personalize their deck of skill cards as they progress through the adventure to create a well-rounded party. It is an incredibly fun and easy game to get into, and a great social experience, based on myhands-on time withSunderfolk.
Sunderfolkwill be available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Steam), and Xbox Series X on April 23. The game costs $49.99.
In addition toSunderfolk’s release date announcement, Dreamhaven and internal studio Moonshot Games also revealed a new project,Wildgate, a crew-based first-person shooter with ship combat.
Dreamhaven also announced Tuesday that it will publish competitive auto battlerMechabellum, which is currently available on Steam. Dreamhaven and developer Game River launched a Premium Edition ofMechabellumon Tuesday, which includes 18 exclusive skins, unique avatars, and special emoticons, for $29.99.
Finally, Dreamhaven announced that developer FuzzyBot’s action-RPGLynked: Banner of the Sparkwill exit Early Access on Steam with the 1.0 release of the game on May 22.Lynked: Banner of the Sparkwill be available on PS5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X for $24.99.

"Ex-Blizzard devs reveal spacey extraction space shooter Wildgate that looks, well, wild",2025-03-25T18:32:19Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/545947/wildgate-dreamhaven-release-date-moonshot-games,"Wildgate is something new from former StarCraft 2 and Hearthstone vets
byMichael McWhertor
Developer Moonshot Games, which is part ofthe studio founded by former Blizzard Entertainment CEO Mike Morhaime, revealed its long-in-development debut game on Tuesday. It’s callWildgate, which its creators describe as “a crew-based first-person shooter.” That description seems to be underselling Moonshot Games’ ambitions for the multiplayer action game.
Wildgate, likeSecret Door’sSunderfolk, is actually a complex but compelling mix of genres. It’s a blend of team-based, first-person shooter gameplay, resource gathering, ship-to-ship combat tactics, subterfuge, and extraction, all of which combine into something that looks intriguingly chaotic and unpredictable.
InWildgate, players take on the role of Prospectors who plunder for space wreckage in pursuit of a McGuffin called the Artifact. Winning requires either escaping from the anomaly known as the Reach through the titular Wildgate, or by eliminating all the other Prospectors you’re playing against. There appears to a wide range of tactics at play. Prospectors can send out probes to survey the Reach in search of treasure and hazards; go on mining and loot expeditions; invade opponents’ ships to sabotage them; and engage in nail-biting ship battles during escape attempts.
There will be a variety of Prospectors, each with their own abilities and tools, and a range of ships to choose from. The Reach is procedurally generated for every game ofWildgate, which should help keep the action fresh every time.
“Wildgatewas designed for anyone that’s ever wanted to go on a daring space adventure alongside a fearless crew,” said Jason Chayes, studio head of Moonshot Games, in a news release forWildgate’s announcement. “Players are invited to work together and confront evolving cosmic threats – whether they’re mysterious hazards of the Reach – or presented by rival Prospectors. We’re counting on you to bring your best-laid plans… and hey, even if they don’t pan out for the win, we’ve found that some of our favorite experiences are the ones we least expect.”
A preview playtest forWildgatewill be available April 10-14, Moonshot and Dreamhaven, the sister studio to Secret Door, announced. The full game is expected to launch sometime in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Steam), and Xbox Series X.
“Wildgate rewards cooperation and tactical mastery in a way that realizes Dreamhaven’s goal to bring players together and help them create lasting memories,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and co-founder of Dreamhaven, in a statement. “Since every match of Wildgate plays differently, there’s tons for you and your friends to discover as you explore the Typhon Reach. Ship-vs-ship combat brings an element of chaos that makes for an especially fun time, and we’re looking forward to players experiencing it for themselves during the playtest.”
Dreamhaven was founded in 2020 by Morhaime two years after the veteran game developerleft Blizzard Entertainment after more than 27 years with the company. Moonshot is led by producer Jason Chayes (Hearthstone,StarCraft 2), designer Dustin Browder (StarCraft 2,Heroes of the Storm), and artist Ben Thompson (Hearthstone,World of Warcrafttrading card game).

My terrific 4K Blu-ray player is 22% off during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale,2025-03-25T16:56:58Z,https://www.polygon.com/good-deals/546096/4k-blu-ray-player-sale-panasonic,"Make the most of your 4K disc collection

Movie theaters: Who needs ’em? If you’ve already got even a decent TV in your house, you may be looking to augment your home theater setup with a 4K Blu-ray player, which will unlock a markedly better viewing experience than streaming movies from Netflix. In that case, look no further than thePanasonic DP-UB820, which is once again on sale at Amazon as part of the company’sBig Spring Sale. It’s down to $387.35, representing a discount of 22% (or more than $100) off the near-$500 regular price.
The price has actually been hovering around this level for most of March, and this has become a semi-regular deal on what I consider to be the best option for physical media playback. Now, you don’t have to spend $400-$500 on a dedicated 4K Blu-ray player; cheaper ones are available, and you could also use a multipurpose device that happens to support 4K discs, like a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. But this higher-end model is one of the few disc players that’s compatible with all of the HDR formats you could possibly want: Dolby Vision and HDR10+ (neither of which is supported by game consoles for disc playback) as well as HDR10 and hybrid log-gamma.
That’s the main benefit of the UB820 over lower-tier 4K Blu-ray players likePanasonic’s own UB420, but it’s a big one. Even if your current TV isn’t compatible with Dolby Vision — Samsung doesn’t support the format at all, for instance — you might want to get this player so you’ll be set when you upgrade at some point in the future. Plus, it has Wi-Fi built in (unlike cheaper Ethernet-only models), and in the event you’re not using a soundbar or a home theater receiver paired with speakers, it sports analog outputs for 7.1-channel audio. I’ve owned a UB820 for a number of years, and I love the thing: On top of delivering a top-tier playback experience, the device is built to last, whereas most lower-end players on the market feel flimsy. If you’re serious about making the most of your4K Blu-ray collection, this is the way to go.

You won’t want to miss the inaugural discount on the 8Bitdo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller atAmazon. Priced at $59.99 at launch back in February, you can pick up the Ultimate 2 for just $47.99 duringAmazon’s Big Spring Sale. Thanks to its relatively low price point and extensive features, the original 8Bitdo Ultimate controller quickly established itself as one of our favorite third-party controllers, and the sequel builds on that legacy.
The Ultimate 2 is aesthetically similar to the original with its Xbox-style layout, but has two new inputs next to the shoulder buttons in addition to the back paddles found on the original. The triggers have also been improved with better Hall-effect sensors, which allow you to fine-tune the travel distance via the 8Bitdo Ultimate app. However, the biggest addition to this controller are six-axis motion controls, a rare feature in third-party controllers.
The joysticks now feature an RGB light ring, but have also been improved with new tunneling magneto-resistance sensors, which are more accurate and power-efficient than the Hall-effect sensors found in the original controller.
The Ultimate 2 doesn’t have Bluetooth connectivity, but is compatible for wireless use with Windows and Android devices thanks to its 2.4 GHz dongle. And, just like the original controller, the Ultimate 2 also comes packaged with a dedicated charging stand, this time with RGB lighting built into the base.

The 10 games that defined the Nintendo Switch,2025-03-24T20:55:02Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/545093/nintendo-switch-most-important-games,"The console’s key games tell the story of a changing Nintendo
byOli WelshandMichael McWhertor
What games do you think of when you think of Nintendo’s Switch? There are several obvious answers; Nintendo’s in-house studios never fail to leave their mark on a system with a handful of brilliant games. Yet one of the most notable things about the Switch, as it prepares to cede the limelight toSwitch 2after eight years on the market, is that it has been less software-dependent than, perhaps, any Nintendo console since the NES.
Of course the Switch wouldn’t be the success it has been without its biggest games. In its first year,The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandMario Kart 8 Deluxehelped the console find a massive audience. Yet both started as games for Wii U, Nintendo’sleastsuccessful platform. The Switch really was a case of a console that carved out a space for itself by arriving with the right form factor at the right time. The games that worked well on it found a console that was uniquely capable of adapting itself to suit them and helping them find players, rather than the other way around.
The Switch began a new era for Nintendo as a platform holder that began to look a little more like the others, even if it continued to play by its own rules. The games that defined the console aren’t necessarilythe bestor the biggest. Shockingly, they don’t include a mainline Mario platform game. They’re the games that described what the Switch meant to players, and how it changed Nintendo — and the rest of the game industry.
Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ unprecedented success on Switch was a mixed blessing. It was in no small part a blockbuster hit due to the devastating worldwide pandemic that forced us indoors and into isolation around its release.New Horizonsgave many of its players a taste of connection and community when they couldn’t physically meet up with friends, family, and colleagues.
ButNew Horizonswas more than just a digital alternative to real-world socializing. It was a place where we made new virtual friends, found comfort in routine, and exercised control over our lives, albeit imaginary ones lived on our own private islands. The coziness of Animal Crossing was a refuge during a difficult stretch.
That’s not to say thatNew Horizonswasn’t an enjoyable evolution of the Animal Crossing experience on its own merits. It was. There was joy to be found in building and customizing a home — and even in paying it off — and exploiting the game’s quirks to amass riches. Millions of us delighted in daily interactions with Isabelle, Blathers, and the Nook boys, and waited with anticipation as new villagers visited our town, praying that we’d pull a “dreamy.” It was a brief taste of video game monoculture, fueled by the state of the world, and a defining moment in the Switch’s success. —Michael McWhertor
Breath of the Wildhas become so inextricably linked with the Switch that it’s easy to forget it was also released on Wii U, and in fact was announced as a Wii U game before we even knew what the Switch was. Nintendo’s decision to pivot it to a cross-gen release gifted the Switch what might be the greatest launch title of all time.
Beyond that, it marked a creative turning point for Nintendo as a game developer, and sent a clear message that the Switch was ushering in a new era for the company. The game’s bold, nonlinear, systemic design was a huge departure for the Zelda series, synthesizing many influences from beyond Nintendo’s Miyamoto-worshipping bubble into something that was distinctive and original, but also felt like it had been made in a world whereSkyrimandMinecrafthad happened. The sequel,Tears of the Kingdom, took things even further by giving players an astonishing, almost game-breaking level of creative freedom.
Breath of the Wildturned one of Nintendo’s oldest franchises into its most modern. It also outsold every mainline Mario game on the Switch, a first for the Zelda series. It was quite clear that Nintendo would never be the same again. —Oli Welsh
Switch was a platform for second chances. Many of Nintendo’s games that failed to break through on the poorly selling Wii U found new life on Switch, including the Splatoon franchise,Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, andCaptain Toad: Treasure Tracker. But none of those ports and rereleases have enjoyed the incredible success ofMario Kart 8 Deluxe, a souped-up version of the 2014 kart racer that has since gone on to outsell its predecessor eight times over.
Mario Kart 8 DeluxeistheSwitch game; two out of every five Switch owners have a copy. It was so successful for Nintendo that, five years afterDeluxelaunched, the company released 48 more courses and eight additional characters as DLC. In an equally important move, Nintendo included that DLC as part of its Nintendo Switch Online subscription, part of the company’s plan to offer more than just multiplayer connectivity and classic games.
It’s telling that the first game Nintendo has shown for Switch 2 is a new Mario Kart.Deluxenot only brought in all-new fans of the Mario Kart franchise, it helped get the storied franchise back on, ahem, track. —MM
Let’s be honest; the Switch is not the ideal platform to playThe Witcher 3. Nintendo’s console is manifestly underpowered for a game that was cutting-edge in 2015 and remained a technical showpiece when Nintendo’s console launched two years later. At the time, Nintendo was also not a natural home for such bloody, sexy, world-weary fare.
This is precisely why the Switch port ofThe Witcher 3is so important. It’s significant that anyone tried to make it, and incredible thatthey pulled it off. Nintendo had long left the world of AAA gaming behind, and even during the success of the Wii, big publishers tended not to bring their marquee titles over because they were too technically demanding or aimed at a perceived different market. When the Wii U flopped, many third parties deserted Nintendo altogether.
The Switch, however, was not just a huge sales success — with its appealing form factor and the undeniableBreath of the Wild, it had thrust Nintendo back into the hearts of the core gaming community. All of a sudden, third parties were clamoring to be part of it, and a few studios began to specialize in cramming AAA titles onto Switch’s aging mobile chipset and into the tight confines of its game cards. A wave of “miracle” ports began with2016’sDoom, and of these, the 2019 port ofThe Witcher 3was the white whale. Not long after, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X widened the technical gulf again to a point where the ports would start to dry up — but you can expect the floodgates to reopen on Switch 2. —OW
“Everyone is here!” Nintendo promised withSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate. The game maker not only kept that promise, it overdelivered with one of the most impressive expansions to any Nintendo franchise ever. In addition to stacking the game’s core roster with 69 playable characters, including every fighter who’d ever appeared in a Smash Bros. game and surprising newcomers like Castlevania’s Simon and Metroid’s Ridley, the game’s developers pulled off what felt like impossible licensing deals. Banjo and Kazooie. Kingdom Hearts’ Sora.Final Fantasy 7’s Sephiroth.Minecraft’s Steve and Alex.
The massive growth of the Switch and the fervor for more Super Smash Bros. seemed to feed off of each other. Led by tireless game makerMasahiro Sakurai, the yearslong development ofSuper Smash Bros. Ultimateresulted in the series’ biggest entry yet, so gargantuan that one has to question if Nintendo and Sakurai can ever top it.
And whileSuper Smash Bros. Ultimatewas a major step forward for the franchise,Nintendo’s approach to esportsand its games being featured at non-Nintendo-sanctioned events hasn’t evolved much during the Switch era. —MM
Who would have seen Labo coming? Nintendo’s DIY “build-and-play” line of accessories let Switch owners craft cardboard “Toy-Con” versions of real-world items like a 13-key piano, fishing rod, and motorbike — and evena VR headset— for an all-new play experience that evoked the wild accessories released during the Wii era.
In retrospect, it’s almost shocking that Nintendo Labo arrived just 13 months after the release of the Switch. What now feels like a late-life cycle attempt to reinvigorate the Switch with a gimmick was just another moment of unexpected innovation from Nintendo.
While interest in Labo died out fairly quickly (building the Toy-Cons was 90% of the fun), it was a reminder of the uniqueness and adaptability of the Switch Joy-Cons to act as more than just conveniently detachable controllers — an idea that Nintendo would later explore with the similarly creative and unexpectedRing Fit Adventure. —MM
It might seem strange to chooseScarletandVioletto represent Pokémon on this list. Of the Switch’s mainline Pokémon titles,SwordandShieldwere better received by fans and even sold better (by a hair’s breadth). But it’s precisely because of theirperformance woesanduninspired designthatScarletandVioletare, sadly, more symptomatic of the Switch era.
The runaway success of the Switch always represented a risk that Nintendo might rush too keenly to capitalize, letting its famous quality control standards slip in the process. As far as its internal studios were concerned, iron discipline was maintained, but Nintendo didn’t have as much success in keeping its partners at The Pokémon Company and developer Game Freak in check.
The Switch saw 12 Pokémon games released in six years, including four (soon to be five) major Game Freak titles; the developer releasedScarletandVioletand the superiorPokémon Legends: Arceusin thesame year. It was just too much, andScarletandVioletbore the signs of an exhausted studio trapped in a content grind. You really can have too much of a good thing. —OW
Pairing the greatest video game of all time with the hot genre of the moment forTetris 99felt both like a uniquely classic Nintendo move and surprisingly forward-thinking for the company. While other game makers chased variations on the battle royale shooter, Nintendo and developer Arika took a different approach, resulting in a frenetically fun, all-ages take on what is traditionally a violent genre.
Shadow-dropped as a bonus perk for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in 2019, the release ofTetris 99brought fresh buzz to the Switch. Its success spawned even more variations on the battle royale formula from Nintendo, withSuper Mario Bros. 35andF-Zero 99. (Arika also created a99-player battle royale version of Pac-Manfor Bandai Namco.)
Tetris 99’s most lasting impact, however, may be its role as a value add for NSO subscribers. Nintendo, having already mined most of its back catalog from the NES and SNES era forNintendo Switch Online’s classic games offerings, will need more games likeTetris 99to keep Switch 2 owners interested and subscribed to the service. —MM
The Switch era has run parallel with a surge in interest in Japanese-made RPGs, and it’s very much not a coincidence. Japanese publishers and developers naturally flooded to the console, which had huge sales in their home market, at the same time as the overseasanime boomcreated just the right cultural environment for these games to have an international moment. Nintendo saw the opportunity and lent a hand, often shining a light on Japanese-made games in its Direct broadcasts, and occasionally stepping in to co-publish games like Square Enix’s gorgeous throwbackOctopath Traveler.
Nintendo was well placed to benefit from this snowball effect with some of its own games, including the Xenoblade Chronicles series. But the ultimate example was 2019’sFire Emblem: Three Houses. Intelligent Systems’ tactical RPG series had always been beloved within its specific niche, but the audience the Switch had amassed for anime-flavored RPGs turned it into something bigger — a sort of viral hit, powered by players’ obsession over the game’s characters and relationships and its Harry Potter-style system of rival school houses.Three Housesshowed how the Switch was, and remains, one of the most fandom-friendly platforms around. —OW
While major third parties took a little longer to turn their oil tankers in Nintendo’s direction, the indie developer scene saw the potential of Nintendo’s machine almost instantly and rushed to take advantage. For several years, it was common for indies to release their hits on Steam and Switch first, and worry about PlayStation and Xbox later. The Switch’s humble tech was no barrier to these games, and the immediacy of their designs often suited portable play perfectly.
The two games that most symbolize the Switch’s indie era are 2018’sHollow Knightand 2020’sHades— both fantastically refined action games in popular genres that are tricky to get right (Metroidvania and roguelike, respectively). Both found huge audiences, thanks in part to the Switch’s enormous reach. Of the two, it’s probably Team Cherry’sHollow Knightthat is more closely associated with the Switch — if only because its long, long-awaited sequelSilksongwas first announced at a Nintendo Direct, and the increasingly desperate anticipation of new info about the game ahead of every Direct since has become a meme. —OW

Palworlddeveloper Pocketpair has one word on its mind, and it’s “beefy.”
During a conversation withIGNat the recently concluded Game Developers Conference, communications director John Buckley saidPalworldwon’t be coming to Switch because the open-world, crafting-focused Pokémon-like is “a beefy game.” A potential Switch 2 release, however, is “worth considering” if Nintendo’s next console is “beefy enough.”
“We haven’t seen [the Switch 2] specs yet,” Buckley said. “Like everyone else, we’re waiting. I’m walking around GDC hoping someone will tell me, but everyone I’ve spoken to says they haven’t even seen them. We did a lot of optimization for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with. Still work to do, but we’re really happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible.”
Palworldmadeheadlinesleading up to its January 2024 release due to its uncanny similarities with the Pokémon franchise both in monster designs and gameplay. The Pokémon Company eventually sued Pocketpair forpatent infringement, prompting an update toPalworld’s summoning mechanicsjust three months later. And while neither studio has said much about the legal proceedings in the months since,PC Gamerreports Buckley briefly addressed the controversy during his GDC talk.
“We did legal checks beforePalworldreleased and they were all cleared in Japan,” Buckley said. “So obviously when the lawsuit was announced we were like, ‘What?’ Pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge [Pokémon] fan, so it was a very depressing day, everyone heads down and walking in the rain.”

PlayStation 5 owners will finally get a chance to playIndiana Jones and The Great Circleon April 17, or April 15 in early access, developer MachineGames and publisher Bethesda Softworks confirmed Monday. The announcement comes with a great bit of comedy, as ubiquitous voice actors Nolan North and Troy Baker — whovoices Indy inThe Great Circle— discuss what it means to embody a video game adventurer in a new clip promoting the release date.
North, the famous voice behind the Uncharted series’ Nathan Drake, serves as something of a mentor to Baker in the video, enlightening his younger colleague about the weight of taking on the role of someone like Indiana Jones, or a character Indiana Jones-adjacent. And frankly, I’d like to see more from these caricatures. North’s pompous-ass version of himself is just as fun as Baker’s put-upon rendition.
Anyway, the news here is thatIndiana Jones and The Great Circleis finally coming to PS5 in April, just four months after the game’s release on Windows PC and Xbox Series X. While the official street date forThe Great Circleis April 17, pre-ordering the game will grant early access on PS5 starting April 15. Digital pre-orders are available now, with physical pre-orders opening March 25.
In addition to launching the PS5 version in April, MachineGames is adding two new whip abilities to all versions of the game: Open Season and Sleight of Hand. Open Season will inflict more damage to enemies on subsequent attacks if they’ve been cracked by Indy’s whip, while Sleight of Hand will let players disarm an enemy and cause their weapon to fly Indy’s way.
Indiana Jones and The Great Circleis an original adventure based on the character created by Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford. The story, set between the events ofRaiders of the Lost ArkandThe Last Crusade, sends Indy on a globetrotting mission as he battles Adolf Hitler’s forces, which are chasing artifacts of great power. Jones teams up with an Italian journalist named Gina Lombardi, who has a personal stake in their journey.
The latest game from the developer behind the modern Wolfenstein games was well-received late last year, andcould’ve been a GOTY contenderif not for its December release. OnMetacritic,The Great Circlehas “generally favorable” reviews, and onSteam, a “very positive” reception from players.

You are Phil Spencer. Which Ubisoft IP do you buy?,2025-03-21T21:29:31Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/544628/ubisoft-ip-sale-microsoft-phil-spencer-not-assassins-creed,"Just a little one. As a treat
byOli Welsh
According toone very annoyed Ubisoft investor, citing a private report by investor service Mergermarket, Ubisoft has been holding secret talks with Microsoft, Electronic Arts, and other publishers who are interested in acquiring some of the troubled publisher’s franchises.
This is interesting in the context of Ubisoft’s current struggles; the floundering publisher hasn’t had a hit in a while, is losing the confidence of investors, and is “exploring strategic options” that include going private and breaking up the company. Thelatest reportssuggest Ubisoft is looking to create a new entity that will hold on to some core intellectual property. Things are so bad that even a stellar launch forAssassin’s Creed Shadowswon’t necessarily fix it all.
It’s also an interesting prompt for assessing the Ubisoft catalog. What properties does Ubisoft have that are worth buying, but that Ubisoft itself can do without? What can Ubisoft sell without throwing its soul into the bargain?
So, I propose a little thought exercise. You are Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming. You have spent many billions acquiring publishers like Bethesda and Activision Blizzard, and studios like Obsidian and Double Fine, in a seeming attempt to own all of gaming (if not to actually sell Xbox consoles). But you are not quite satiated yet, and the spectacle of a floundering French publisher conducting a yard sale of storied franchises is too tempting to resist. Maybe just a little one? As a treat?
What will you choose? For the purposes of this exercise, we’ll assume that Assassin’s Creed is not for sale; it’s Ubisoft’s flagship, and without it the publisher might as well just close up shop. To a lesser extent, the same goes for Far Cry. And we’ll also assume that all the Tom Clancy games are off the table. It’s true that some parts of the Clancyverse seem ripe for the picking — for example, Splinter Cell, a fondly remembered stealth action series (with strong links to Xbox) that Ubisoft is currently doing nothing with. But it seems unlikely that the Clancy estate would be interested in breaking these properties up — and there’s no way Ubisoft is letting go of Rainbow Six, which is one of its most reliable cash cows.
So, what’s left in the shop window to tempt a browsing Microsoft exec?
Well now. This one is quite tempting, isn’t it? A largely dormant action-adventure franchise, recently revived by a quality Metroidvania, but with a major reboot wallowing in development hell. You never really had anything to match Uncharted with. This could be it, maybe… although corporate might not like the optics of an American giant swooping in to acquire the most famous Middle Eastern gaming icon. Especially in… the current climate.
You never really had a platforming mascot to speak of, but this one is just soprofoundlyFrench it’s impossible to imagine it as a standard-bearer for the greenest, most American game console. Respectfully, it’s a hard pass.
The same ought to apply to Ubisoft’s funny little rabbit guys, but if you squint, they look an awful lot like Minions. And Minions arehugewith kids. Family franchises are a bit of a blind spot for Xbox. On the other hand, the only decent games the Rabbids have ever been in also starred Mario, and Furukawa-san over at Nintendo probably won’t be into it. (You need to call him, though, about putting every single one of your franchises on Switch 2 — it never hurts to ask!)
This is a multiplayer game you’ve never heard of about medieval warriors beating each other up. But there’s a note on the sticker that Ubisoft reckons it has35 million players? That can’t be right. Have your team pull the data on that one. Might be worth it, if it’s cheap. Who doesn’t like swords?
You actuallydohave Forza Horizon at home. So it’s a pass.
Oh man, you remember loving the original one on PlayStation. And didn’t they do that wacky one that was all about a ghost policeman possessing cars? That was cool. You have enough driving games, but this one’s a little bit different, a bit funky. Ask if they’ll throw it in with something else.
[You have a Kinect trauma flashback and curl up in a ball on the floor.]
You didn’t spend $7.5 billion acquiring The Elder Scrolls for nothing. Except, apparently you did, because the next one is never coming out, and Obsidian could probably churn out three Might and Magic games for you by next week. Still though… nah.
Somehow, despite buying half the game industry, you don’t really have any GTA-style open-world games, and to Ubi’s credit, Watch Dogs got quite good; you remember thinking the last one,Legion, was pretty fun. If theyreallywon’t let you have Assassin’s Creed (note to self: up offer by $0.5-1 billion), you could see yourself owning this. But then… it’s not actually GTA or Assassin’s Creed, is it? It’s not even Far Cry.
Nowyou’re talking. A franchise that was maybe never actually popular, but that has ascended into fanboy myth status. A directionless vaporware project that’s been stuck in development hell for somewhere between 10 and 20 years. But you couldsaveit, Phil. Think of the gamer cred! Think how cool your T-shirt reveal would be! It’s just so Xbox. It’s just soyou. Where’s Satya’s company card?

The new game releases this week are a little bizarre. Whether it’s taking a pretty grim concept and putting it into a cute aesthetic or literally stepping into dreams, these games are playing with surrealism. It helps that a lot of them are tied to familiar genres, because the places they go might be a little uncomfortable.
Spilled!is a colorful little game about cleaning up oil and plastic. It looks chill and inviting, but your job is to save the world from all the waste. Over inAtomfall, the world is already gone, ravaged by a nuclear disaster. There are bright green fields warped by irradiated fissures and melted buildings. The nightmares continue inKarma: The Dark World, a horror game where you solve crimes by hopping into the heads of the suspects. And at the end of the week,InZoiarrives with its uncanny characters and hyperrealistic cities. It may be a chill life sim, but it can’t escape feeling a little disturbing with howperfecteverything is.
Here are our most anticipated game releases for the week of March 24.
Release date:March 26Platforms:Mac, Windows PCThis is a game about cleaning up the ocean with your fancy boat. There are oil spills, discard plastic, and fires to take care of in each level, as well as some cute animals to save.
Release date:March 27Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XIt’s that time again — Soulslike time. This game is a mix ofSekiroand other action RPGs, with tense combat and tons of weapons to wield. Unlike a lot of Soulslikes, however, it also has an easy difficulty option that makes it approachable for newcomers to the genre.
Release date:March 27Platforms:PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XWelcome to STALKER in the British countryside. This shooter is about surviving after a nuclear disaster. Everything is scarce all the time, forcing you to weigh your options when confronted with combat and even seemingly friendly NPCs.
Release date:March 27Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PCThis is a sci-fi game with Soulslike combat. You have a huge arsenal of weapons and spells to use against a bunch of otherworldly beasts. Don’t expect slow,Dark Souls-style combat in this one.
Release date:March 27Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis game sounds like a mix of a detective game and a psychological horror game. The world is controlled by a big corporation, and you play as a detective who can step into the minds of suspects. I’m sure nothing scary will happen with that.
Release date:March 28Platforms:Windows PC (early access)Here’s a life sim with a hyperrealistic look. You create a character and then pick a city to live in. From there, it’s your job to customize the city with food trucks and parks to keep everyone happy. The game is launching in early access, so expect a bunch of updates as time goes on.

How to play offline single-player in Monster Hunter Wilds,2025-03-21T17:44:48Z,https://www.polygon.com/monster-hunter-wilds-guide/542541/how-to-play-offline-single-player,"Sometimes you need a break from all the randos
byAna Diaz
If you have an internet connection and the right subscriptions,Monster Hunter Wildsallows you to play in a lobby with a whole bunch of other people online. But sometimes you just want to playoffline single-player.
For some, an online lobby can be super helpful. Stronger players can swoop in and help you defeat tough monsters and give you the support you need. However, that’s not always the experience a hunter wants, and many might prefer to take on each challenge by themselves.
This guide will show you how to play both online and offline single-player inMonster Hunter Wilds.
Before we get into all the ways to play offline, there is technically a way you can stay “online” but continue the game in a single-player.
To do so, go and find Alma, the character who manages the quest counter. (Finding her shouldn’t be too hard since she accompanies you almost everywhere in between assignments — however, you can also find her in any basecamp. She often sits by your tent in at each basecamp.)
Talk to her to access the Quest Counter and tab over to the “Change Lobby Menu” page. Once there, select the option, “Online Single Player” the setting will alter the game so you continue your adventure in single-player. If you play in this mode, other players will only be able to join you for the duration of the quest you’re on. (If you don’t fire an SOS flare, you will never see another player in this mode.)
For more information on how to play with other people, check out our onlinemultiplayerguide.
There is one sure way to make sure you playMonster Hunter Wildsoffline:Disconnect your console or PC from the internet.
If you’re using a PC, you can either unplug your ethernet cable or turn Wi-Fi off under “Network & Internet” in the system settings. But here’s how to do so on consoles.

Future Games Show trailer reopens the story of banger horror comic I Hate This Place,2025-03-21T17:13:36Z,https://www.polygon.com/trailer/544255/i-hate-this-place-horror-game-comic-adaptation,"Its original title was ‘F*ck This Place’
bySusana Polo
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
I Hate This Place, the 2022 horror series from writer Kyle Starks and artist Artyom Toplin, wasone of my favorite comicsthat year. And now, as revealed in the Future Games Show, it’s a neon-colored isometric open-world survival horror game that I’ll probably be too chicken to play.
I Hate This Place— originally announced asFuck This Place, which is a way better title, but, like, I get it — starred Gabby and Trudy, a lesbian couple who see the cattle ranch they just inherited as their ticket to financial stability. Unfortunately, the family ranch is secretly a locus for every horror genre simultaneously: hauntings, alien abductions, a Strange Entity in the Forest, Secret Knife Killer Hiding Among You, the Place Won’t Let You Leave, Survivalist Cult Apocalypse, and so on.I Hate This Placewas kind of like… “Fast Car” meetsThe Cabin in the Woods.
The new game adaptation is being developed by Bloober Team (2019’sBlair Witch,The Medium), under the company’s new horror imprint Broken Mirror Games, and appears to focus on an original story set in the comic’s titular Place, potentially a prequel. “Players take on the role of Elena, whose fight for survival begins when she unwittingly awakens a malevolent force,” says a joint news release from Bloober Team andI Hate This Place(the comic)’s Skybound Entertainment. The game will feature “retro ‘80s comic book aesthetics,” where the original comic was set in the modern day.
“Each location is lovingly crafted to tell its own disturbing story through stylish visuals that blur the line between reality and nightmare in a world where everything wants you dead.” According to the news release, gameplay will feature “tense gunfights and melee combat that rewards ingenuity over brute force, all while crafting essential tools to survive the harsh and unforgiving wilderness long enough to reach safehouses before nightfall, with the day & night cycle having an impact on gameplay dynamics.”
I Hate This Placeis currently set to launch in Q4 of 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch. It’s available to wishlist onSteamand theEpic Games Store, and you could pick up the comic that inspired it onAmazon,Bookshop, or at your local store.

Is Steam coming to Xbox?,2025-03-21T13:22:24Z,https://www.polygon.com/analysis/544182/steam-xbox-integration,"A leaked image suggests Steam is coming to the Xbox PC app — and maybe consoles, too
byOli Welsh
Microsoft seems intent on tearing down the norms of game-industry competition between platforms. Not content with publishingprecious first-party games on rival consoles, it now looks as though Xbox is ready to link arms with the leading PC gaming platform, Steam.
The Verge reportsthat Microsoft briefly published an image on Thursday depicting a new, cross-device user interface for Xbox. A filter for “Steam” is clearly visible in the view of a user’s game library shown in the image.
The image was published in a blog titled “Opening a Billion Doors with Xbox” about Microsoft’s currentplatform-agnostic strategy. (Sample quote: “Our goal is simple: to make every screen in the world an Xbox.”) The image was apparently quickly removed by Microsoft after The Verge inquired about it.
The publication of the image seems to have been a mistake. Does it really indicate that Steam integration is coming to Xbox? And, in a world where every screen is an Xbox, what does that mean exactly?
It’s certainly not outlandish that Microsoft might seek to make users’ Steam libraries visible within the Xbox PC app in this way. The Verge’s sources said that Microsoft plans to make every game installed on a PC visible within the Xbox app, and other PC game launchers, like GOG, do this.
But there’s also a real chance that Microsoft is thinking of expanding Steam integration beyond desktop PCs. The image shows the new Xbox UI running on multiple devices: a laptop, a phone, a tablet, and an Asus ROG Ally handheld, as well as a TV. Xbox consoles are also pictured. This is consistent with Microsoft’s announced strategy tocombine Windows and Xbox experiencesin a new, unified UI that will reportedly feature on anXbox-branded PC handheld from a partner manufactureras early as this year.
Could Steam integration come to future Xbox consoles as well as desktop and handheld PCs? It’s far from fanciful to suggest it. Xbox chiefPhil Spencer told Polygon last yearthat he thinks console platforms should be more open, like PCs, and that he’s open to putting rival storefronts like the Epic Games Store — or, it follows, Steam — on Xbox consoles.
Windows Centralrefers to persistent rumors of a partnership between Microsoft and Valve to put Steam on the next generation of Xbox consoles — rumors that Polygon has also heard (but not verified). The next-gen Xbox consoles — a dedicated handheld, and a successor to the Xbox Series X — aresaid to be more PC-like devices, running on a Windows-based development environment.
Considering all that, it’s surprisingly easy to picture Steam as an integral part of Xbox in future. This latest image is likely a mock-up, and its publication was surely an unintended slip. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a sign of things to come.

Silent Hill 2 remake devs’ new horror game might scratch that Dead Space itch,2025-03-20T21:47:26Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/543865/bloober-team-cronos-new-dawn-survival-horror,"Bloober Team’s Cronos: The New Dawn looks scary good
byMichael McWhertor
After Bloober Team’s excellentSilent Hill 2remake, I’m willing to give the developer the benefit of the doubt when it comes to its brand of horror games. It certainly helps that its next effort,Cronos: The New Dawn, looks incredible and is giving off goryDead Spacevibes.
Cronos: The New Dawnco-directors Wojciech Piejko and Jacek Zięba make their inspirations pretty explicit in a new look at the sci-fi survival horror game.Cronosdraws on John Carpenter’sThe Thing, German TV seriesDark, and Terry Gilliam’s12 Monkeysfor inspiration, the duo say, as well as games likeDead SpaceandDark Souls.Cronosshares some familiar attributes fromDead Space, including terrifying human mutations as enemies, an over-the-shoulder shooting perspective, and a limb-severing mechanic — though Piejko says Bloober Team is taking a different approach to dismemberment than Visceral Games did.
In a follow-up to acinematic reveal trailer forCronos: The New Dawnreleased last October, Piejko and Zięba showed off some gameplay in a new dev diary Bloober Team released Thursday. The pair explain how protagonist the Traveller, who they liken to a deep-sea diver who plunges into the depths of time, is sent into the ruins of human civilization to extract survivors. The alternate-reality world ofCronoshas been ravaged by an event called the Change, which in the game’s fiction, destroyed our world in the 1980s.
Piejko and Zięba previously worked on Bloober Team’sObserverandThe Medium, so they have plenty of experience with sci-fi and psychological horror.Cronos: The New Dawnis an original property for Bloober, which is also working on a follow-up with Konami.
Cronos: The New Dawnis coming to PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X sometime in 2025. It’s a welcome new entry in the AAA sci-fi survival horror space, especially since theDead Spaceremake team is now working on the next Battlefield and EA’s Iron Man game.

The first extended look at Remedy’s co-op shooter FBC: Firebreak is completely bonkers,2025-03-20T21:35:01Z,https://www.polygon.com/trailer/543773/fbc-firebreak-paper-chase-trailer-preview,"Quite the sticky situation we got ourselves here
byToussaint Egan
Remedy Entertainment is no stranger to unconventional ballistics. The Finnish game developer is well known for its eclectic, boundary-pushing approach to third-person shooters with titles such asMax Payne,Alan Wake,Quantum Break, andControl. But a co-op first-person shooter where you fight, among other threats, a sentient swarm of Post-it notes? That’s a new one.
On Thursday at Future Games Show, Remedy debuted a new trailer forFBC: Firebreak, the studio’s upcoming first-person shooter set in theRemedy Connected Universe. Taking place six years after the events of 2019’sControl, the game centers on Firebreak, a team of volunteer “first responders” who act as the first and last line of defense between the remaining members of the Federal Bureau of Control and the Hiss, the hostile supernatural resonance that’s possessed their former co-workers. FBC’s Firebreak team finds itself trapped inside the extradimensional office building known as the Oldest House, with the Hiss trapped alongside them, waiting to attack.
The trailer, titled “Paper Chase,” shows a three-player team working together to clear out an infestation of malevolent sticky notes that have overtaken the executive sector of the Oldest House, along with a swath of Hiss-possessed FBC employees. Using improvised weapons and tools including what appears to be an electrified pneumatic jump firearm, a high-pressure water cannon to blast away sticky notes obscuring a player’s field of vision, and an explosiveObject of Powerresembling a piggy bank, players move between various containment zones and safe rooms collecting ammo and items.
The trailer culminates with players fighting against a group of anthropomorphic masses of sticky notes before facing off against a massive monster referred to simply as “Sticky Ricky.” It’s impressive, exciting, and unabashedly bonkers.
Polygon attended a virtual press event on March 11 where Remedy showed off an extended playthrough of the mission featured in the trailer, as well as a presentation on the game’s core pillars led byFBC: Firebreakgame director Mike Kayatta.
“From day one, we asked ourselves this question over and over again anytime we had an idea we wanted to pitch out to the others in the team: Could this happen only inControl, and could this happen only at Remedy? Is this something that only us weirdos on the team were willing to put into a game with the Remedy label on it, and if the answer was yes, then we thought we were on the right track,” Kayatta said.
At its core,FBC: Firebreakis designed to prioritize pick-up-and-play potential, ditching the engagement stress of daily check-ins, monthly grinds, and battle passes that bifurcate experiences between casual and hardcore gamers. “However much you’ve played or your friends have played, no matter how good you are versus how good they are, it doesn’t matter,” said Kayatta. “We want to have some way of playing this game with anyone who wants to play it with us, and we’ll give you a lot of options to kind of create that experience.”
Those options boil down to three major factors at the outset of the game. The first are “jobs,”FBC: Firebreak’s in-game terminology for missions that players can choose to tackle. Each job is set in one of the sectors of the Oldest House with its own unique objective. The second is “Threat & Clearance Level,” which are essentially modifiers that players can select before embarking on a job that determines the combat difficulty (Threat) and the number of combat zones from one to three (Clearance). The Threat & Clearance Level you choose can afford for greater challenges and the possibility of greater rewards. Finally, there are Crisis Kits — weapon and skill loadouts that give players the ability to emphasize one of three unique play styles that players can switch between mid-job.
In addition to all these options, players can also collect and equip Research Perks that entail different abilities that modify your skills, à laControl’s Personal Mods, and become stronger when paired with perks of the same type. The result, in theory at least, is an interoperable core experience that emphasizes teamwork, creativity, and moment-to-moment spontaneity.
When prompted as to whether or not players would have to playControlin order to fully understand or enjoyFBC: Firebreak, Kayatta emphasized that Remedy’s 2019 action-adventure game is intended to be complementary to this new game, not compulsory. “It’s really important to us to kind of protect two groups of players with this game. One are theControlpeople. We don’t want you to feel as though you have to divert into a genre you don’t feel comfortable with to follow the story of these characters and to understand what happened. We also want to protect non-Controlplayers by making sure that they don’t need to have that backstory to fully understand anybody that we present them with.”
All post-launch downloadable content, such as new jobs, will be free for allFBC: Firebreakowners, with optional cosmetic items available to purchase. Cross-play will be supported, allowing those who own the game to play with one another regardless of whether they own the game on console or PC. While Kayatta and co. were cagey about the exact details of what Remedy has in mind for the game’s post-launch content map, it’s likely thatFBC: Firebreakwill at some point in the future bridge the gap between the events of 2019’sControland the upcomingControl 2, which is currently in production.
As a longtime fan of the studio, I’m impressed with what I’ve seen of the game so far and eager to dive back into the paranatural shenanigans of the Remedy Connected Universe whenFBC: Firebreaklaunches on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X this summer.

Nightdive Studios announces launch date for System Shock 2 remake,2025-03-20T21:05:29Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/543748/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-edition-launch-release-date-nightdive-studios,"The System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Edition comes to PC and consoles June 26

System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Edition(formerly titledSystem Shock 2: Enhanced Edition) will be arriving on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch on June 26, courtesy of Nightdive Studios. Announced at the Future Game Show Spring Showcase, the25th Anniversary Editionbrings a fresh coat of paint to the classic 1999 sci-fi horror game and will be the first classic System Shock title playable on consoles.
This effort isn’t nearly as extensive as the excellentSystem Shockfrom 2023, butSystem Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Editionstill features a massive graphics overhaul with updated textures and ultrawide support, in addition to new audio recordings and a litany of quality-of-life improvements to make the game more palatable for modern audiences. Nightdive took a similar approach to its Enhanced Edition of the originalSystem Shock, turning the previously obtuse title into what many consider the ideal way to play the 1994 game.
Over the past 25 years,System Shock 2has received aremarkable amount of community supportin the form of patches, higher-resolution textures, and other fixes. These mods offer an excellent version ofSystem Shock 2, but the process of getting everything running properly makes the experience relatively hostile to new players. The25th Anniversary Editionintegrates many of these improvements while optimizing aspects ofSystem Shock 2that haven’t been touched since 1999.System Shock 2is one of my favorite games of all time, and I’m excited for a new generation of players to experience the maiden voyage of the Von Braun when the game comes out in June.

bySusana Polo
MystandRivendeveloper Cyan Worlds surprised fans of its three-decades-old-and-counting game franchise this week by dropping an entire new world you can explore for free into its most recent remaster of 1993’sMyst. The setting, Rime, is new toMyst(2020), though not to the franchise as a whole — it was originally designed 25 years ago, for Cyan’s first attempt at building a 3D version of the classic 2D puzzle game.
Cyan teased the addition Friday on X, witha cryptic postcomprised of code and an imitation broken .jpg image. But no alternate-reality game mechanic is safe from Cyan’s puzzle-hounding fanbase, and several clues corresponding to Rime’s 2000 gameplay were quickly uncovered. The developerconfirmed those suspicions on Tuesday.
Rime was not included in the original development ofMystin the 1990s, but was added as an extra explorable world with the release ofRealMyst: Interactive 3D Editionin 2000. The snowy setting expanded on the broader plot of the later Myst franchise, building more of a narrative bridge toRiventhan its creators had been capable of whenMystwas the beginning and end of the story.RealMystwas ported into Unity in 2014, with Rime intact, but when Cyan set about remasteringMystfor the high resolution and VR displays of the 2020s, the extra world fell by the wayside for the game’s Unreal Engine/VR compatible remaster in 2020.
The Rime update forMyst(2020) is now available to anyone who owns the game on PC, Mac, or Meta Quest, with updates for Xbox One and Xbox Series X coming soon, according to Cyan’s news release. The update is free on all platforms. And while Rime is a remastered throwback, Cyan also promises that the update includes “all-new narrative beats, lore and visuals.”
“A NEW AGE (with new surprises)!” said Cyan’s X postconfirming Rime’s return. And it should take about… five minutes for the Myst fandom to sleuth out all those surprises, if we had to estimate.

Nintendo’s Switch 2 marketing blitz includes a big deal with MLB,2025-03-20T14:25:52Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/543331/nintendo-switch-2-mlb-seattle-mariners,"A Switch 2 sports announcement
byMichael McWhertor
Get ready to see a lot of Nintendo logos this summer, especially if you’re a fan of Major League Baseball. The Seattle Mariners announced Thursday that they’ve partnered with Nintendo as the team’s “first-ever official jersey sleeve partner.” That means that the Nintendo logo and theNintendo Switch 2logo will be featured on Mariners players’ sleeves, starting March 27.
Nintendo’s “racetrack” logo will appear on Mariners’ home jerseys, while the (much beefier) Switch 2 logo will appear on the team’s away jerseys. According to the Mariners, that will make the Seattle-based team the first in the MLB to feature different marks for home and away games.
“Nintendo and the Mariners have been inextricably linked since 1992,” Seattle Mariners president of business operations Kevin Martinez said in a statement. Martinez is referring to when Redmond, Wash.-based Nintendo of America purchased the Mariners in the early ’90s. (Nintendo sold its stake in the team in 2016.) “Now, each time the Mariners take the field, our jersey sleeves will help serve as a reminder of all that Nintendo of America has done for the Northwest community and the team.”
Logos of video game companies appearing on U.S.-based sports teams is incredibly rare. While gaming brands are commonplace in sports racing circles andin European football leagues, Seattle is something of an exception. Another local team, Seattle Sounders FC, featured an Xbox logo on its jerseys from 2009 to 2016.
Advertisements on MLB jerseys were all-but forbidden before before 2022. The league’s 2022-2027 collective bargaining agreement allows for a small shoulder patch with a corporate logo or image on one sleeve of players’ uniforms and batting helmets.
You can see the Seattle Mariners’ new Nintendo branding next week, when the team hosts the Athletics on opening day.

The GDC Awards’ 2025 Game of the Year winners are rolling in,2025-03-20T02:01:38Z,https://www.polygon.com/events/542599/gdc-awards-2025-winners-igf,"The influential industry event names its GOTY picks
byMatt Patches
While the scale of December’s The Game Awards has given the trailer-heavy show the glow of the gaming industry’s Oscar equivalent, the annual Game Developers Choice Awards and Independent Game Festival Awards, held together each year at GDC, are closer to an Academy Awards-like event. Voted on by artists and craftspeople who make games, the GDC Awards represent a different perspective on “Game of the Year” — even if the winners often align with the TGAs.
On Wednesday, devs from around the world congregated at the GDC main stage in San Francisco to celebrate the full swatch of 2024 games, from indie to AAA. Here are the categories for both the GDC Awards and IGF Awards, the full slates of nominees, and winners (in bold).

The best scenic driving routes in the Forza Horizon games,2025-03-19T21:32:21Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/540867/forza-horizon-scenic-driving-routes,"Playground Games’ series offers some spectacular virtual sightseeing
byOli Welsh
What’s better than the idea of a road trip? It’s one of the most romantic and liberating forms of travel — combining go-anywhere freedom with the ability to quickly cover large distances and drink in the landscape as you travel. In the real world, though, clogged roads and energy efficiency concerns can dent your enjoyment; motor touring isn’t quite what it was in its mid-20th-century heyday.
Fortunately, we have a great virtual alternative. The Forza Horizon series of racing games is set in huge open-world maps based on stunning, real-world tourist destinations: Colorado, the Mediterranean coast, Australia, the British mainland, and Mexico. Each game compresses some of its chosen area’s most iconic scenery into one artfully rearranged map, studded with towns, sweeping freeways, and winding mountain roads. The artists and technicians at Playground Games have made sure it all looks absolutely gorgeous, too. The result is some of the best virtual tourism you’ll find.
This week on Polygon, we’re looking at games that feel like vacations for your brain in a package we’re callingRetreat Week.
Below, I’ve mapped out some of my favorite sightseeing tours from across all five Forza Horizon games. Sadly, due to the car and music licensing issues that beset so many racing games, all butForza Horizon 5have been delisted from sale. But they’re all backward compatible on Xbox Series X, so if you already own them, or can pick up physical copies, they’re still eminently playable, and all recommended. To make things easy, the routes all use the in-game GPS.
Some driving tips for your scenic tours: Remember, it’s not a race! You don’t need to use your fastest car — in fact, something from a slower class is probably preferable, so you have time to take in the scenery and won’t need to be so focused on not crashing. Choose a car with an engine that sounds good to you, go easy on the accelerator, and consider using manual transmission and shifting up early to keep the revs low and chill. Camera is a matter of personal preference, but if you use a third-person rather than in-car view, you can use the right stick to smoothly pan around and check out the view as you cruise. Tune in your favorite radio station — or turn it off entirely — and enjoy.
The first Forza Horizon game, from 2012, is set on a relatively compact map, inspired by the U.S. state of Colorado, yet it still has a real sense of scale as it sweeps from the red-rock canyons of the Southwest through open plains and autumnal woodlands to the drama of the Rockies. Whether you play it on Xbox 360 or in 4K on Xbox Series X, this is a beautiful-looking game with scenery worth drinking in.
Route 1: Downtown Carson to Red Rock Observatory
Start at the North Carson Horizon Outpost, then set a route to the Horizon Outpost in Red Rock Heights in the southwest corner of the map. This quintessentially American road trip takes you through a modern downtown then out onto the plains, with a view of the main Horizon Festival site to the east. Then you make a spectacular, winding climb up past russet-hued spires and cliffs of rock, and are rewarded at the end with a breathtaking view over the whole map toward the Rockies.
Route 2: Gladstone Creek to Finley Dam
Start at the Gladstone Creek Horizon Outpost, then set a route to the Rockstar Cliff Run race on the far eastern edge of the map. This mountain route cuts through a dramatically deep gorge, through a tall pine forest, and past a stunning waterfall, with an impressive, snow-capped peak towering over you all the way. It finishes by cutting down to a dam clearly inspired by the real-life Hoover Dam — a monumental slab of curved concrete backed by a glassy reservoir.
Recommended rides:I used my 1957 Ferrari 250 California for these drives, but if you want to honor the American auto industry, how about the 1970 Ford Mustang Boss 429?
While it still takes some pretty big geographical liberties, the second game’s map — which takes in a small corner of southeastern France and northwestern Italy — is designed with a little more specificity and realism than the others. As a consequence, it’s not the most varied or spectacular location in the series, but it makes up for that with a gorgeously evocative rendition of the area’s glamorous Mediterranean coastline and rustic landscape, dotted with historic medieval towns.
Route 1: Nice to Castelletto
Start at the Nice Masséna festival hub and set a route for the Il Tricolore Aereo event in the southeastern corner of the map. This istheclassic Mediterranean coast drive, starting in the chic metropolis of Nice and then winding under vertiginous cliffs, with a romantic sea view to the right, all the way to the charming port town Castelletto. Continue a little way past the event start point for a stunning view over the bay.
Route 2: San Giovanni to Tenuta Montellino
Fast travel to the San Giovanni festival hub and set a route to the lakeside castle of Tenuta Montellino, not far to the northeast. Take a minute to explore the cobbled streets of the medieval walled town of San Giovanni before you set off for the castle. On the way, you’ll take in a sweeping view over vineyards and rows of cypress trees, with the rugged Maritime Alps spread out in a petrol-blue haze on the horizon.
Recommended rides:For opening-of-TheItalian Jobvibes, it’s got to be the 1967 Lamborghini Miura. But if you want something a little less slippery in the bends on the winding coast road, a 1992 Lancia Delta HF Integrale won’t go wrong.
This is perhaps Playground Games’ most fanciful map, cramming in every conceivable biome from Australia’s vast landmass: Outback wilderness, subtropical rainforest, winemaking valleys, and surfing coastline. It’s pretty spectacular, and it’s also very off-road-friendly, so feel free to wander off the beaten track as you explore. Handily for our purposes,Forza Horizon 3also introduces Beauty Spots that highlight some of the game’s best views.
Route 1: Surfers Paradise to the Twelve Apostles
Start from the Surfers Paradise festival hub and set a route to the Ocean View Trail race starting line in the southeast. This is a straightforward bomb down the east coast with some dramatic off-road beach driving. It starts in a glassy, Melbourne-inspired cityscape, cuts through the rusting hulks of the Silver Sands Shipwrecks, takes in a stretch of the Great Ocean Road, and ends with a drive through the towering coastal rock formations of the Twelve Apostles. Carry on to the end of the beach and turn up to the Apostles Cliff Danger Sign for a great view back along the coast.
Route 2: Glass House Mountain to Ormiston Gorge
Start at the Glass House Mountain Beauty Spot, south of the center of the map, and set a route for the Ormiston Gorge Beauty Spot in the far north. You set off into the heart of the Maroondah rainforest, with its towering trees; as you emerge from the forest, be sure to check over your right shoulder for a great view of the blunt mass of the Glass House peak. Then you swoop down through farmland into the parched, rust-hued Outback, splashing through shallow riverbeds on your way to the deep gorge.
Recommended rides:An off-road vehicle is a good idea, and captures the rugged spirit of the map. The humble 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor, America’s workhorse, is a great pick. Alternatively, for local color, you can’t beat the 1974 Holden Sandman HQ Panel Van (with surfboard roof rack, of course).
Playground Games is on its home turf with this U.K. map, and it might be the studio’s greatest achievement. Balancing the spectacle of3with the authenticity of2, it’s a gorgeously romantic evocation of the British mainland. In its surprisingly accurate rendition of Edinburgh, it also has the best cityscape in the series by far.
Route 1: Glenfinnan Viaduct to Arthur’s Seat
Start from the Glen Rannoch Trail event in the northwest and set a route to the Holyrood Park Drift Zone over in the northeast part of the map. This stunning Scottish tour takes you under the Glenfinnan Viaduct, through stark Highland scenery, and down into Edinburgh, where you’ll blast past Edinburgh Castle and the Scott Monument before heading down the Royal Mile and up onto the rocky hillsides of Arthur’s Seat. If your car is up to it, go off-road at the end and climb up for a beautiful view over the city and the Firth of Forth.
Route 2: Broadway to Bamburgh Castle
Fast travel to the starting line for The Colossus on the map’s southern edge, and set a route for the Bamburgh Castle player house on the eastern coast. (The GPS will try to take you up the motorway — ignore this and turn right at the roundabout to head up the coast road instead.) This drive somehow takes you from a quaint Cotswold village watched over by an old windmill, through typical English countryside, to an impressive castle on the windswept coast of Northumberland.
Recommended rides:Choose a classic British sports car — this game has loads of them. Perhaps the 1965 Austin-Healey 3000 or 1964 Aston Martin DB5, or, if you really want to ride in aristocratic British style, the gigantic 1931 supercharged Bentley.
Forza Horizon 5’s huge Mexico map, dominated by the high-altitude Gran Caldera volcano, matches3’s Australia for sheer variety and spectacle. There are plenty of astonishing vistas to be found across its landscape of rainforest, sand dunes, scrubland, and verdant hills. And, like4before it, it benefits from the atmospheric seasons that change weekly, bringing monsoons and blazing heat.
Route 1: Gran Telescopio to Dunas Blancas
Fast travel to the starting line for Las Dunas Cross Country, on the summit of La Gran Caldera volcano, and set a route for the Buenas Vistas player house on the map’s western edge. The GPS will send you down the switchbacks, but ignore this and drive over the Event Horizon Danger Sign and down the side of the mountain on a vertiginous but straight track. You can then either follow the new GPS route or, if your car is up to it, just head for the destination marker and power over the dunes. This route takes you through an otherworldly landscape — starting from a stratospheric altitude, with view to match, and through the towering white dunes of Dunas Blancas, ending with a great view of the El Arco de Cabo San Lucas rock formations.
Route 2: Guanajuato to Ek’ Balam
Fast travel to the starting point for the Panorámica Sprint, and set a route for anywhere in Ek’ Balam in the southeast. This tour takes you from the popping pastel colors of the map’s main city, Guanajuato, through a fertile, humid farming region and into the southern rainforests, ending at the ancient ruins of Ek’ Balam, where you can freely explore.
Recommended rides:For the first route, a buggy or rally raid car like the 1969 Volkswagen Baja Bug would be perfect. For the second, why not chill out (and look great against the colors of Guanajuato) behind the wheel of a 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air?

33 quick Assassin’s Creed Shadows tips in no particular order,2025-03-19T18:43:49Z,https://www.polygon.com/assassins-creed-shadows-guides/540303/beginners-tips-tricks-before-you-start,"Nothing is true — except this starter advice
byAri Notis
Make no mistake:Assassin’s Creed Shadowsis an Assassin’s Creed game to its core. You probably have a general idea of what to expect. Sneaking past bad guys. Stabbing bad guys. Climbing tall structures and elegantly diving into hay bales that happen to be next to some bad guys (who you then stab).
Still, thanks to its massive scope,Assassin’s Creed Shadowshas so many moving parts even the most stalwart series fan can get tripped up.
Below, we’ve collected 33beginner’s tips forAssassins’s Creed Shadows.
1.Before you start:Immersive modeis actually really cool. Rather than one language track, you’ll hear characters speak in their natural tongue (Japanese, Portuguese, English, and so on).
2.Love Assassin’s Creed stories and lore? In that case, before you start, turn oncanon mode, which removes dialogue options. (But if you just want a solid RPG, you can ignore it.)
3.Assassin’s Creed Shadowscan be very visually dark — especially in caves and at nighttime. The screenshot below, for what it’s worth, is unaltered. We recommend turning the brightness up a few notches.
4.Assassin’s Creed Shadowsstars two protagonists (Naoe and Yasuke), but you won’tunlock Yasukefor a while. Like, areallylong while. Even if you’re rushing through themain story, give yourself at least 10 hours.
5.When you’ve eventually unlocked both characters, use Yasuke for combat and Naoe for stealth. For the most part. Naoe isn’t entirely useless in combat, for what it’s worth — just remember to use her kusarigamaweapon. And Yasuke can technically perform stealth attacks, depending on how you invest in his skill trees.
6.The differences extend to navigation, too. Yasuke can run through walls butcan’twalk on tightropes. Naoe can’t move heavy crates butcangrapple across lengthy gaps. And we implore you: At least once, try to do a leap of faith as Yasuke.
7.You can do most quests as either character. Though if you literally are unable to do a quest as one or the other, the game will tell you (either through a notification or through a character’s spoken dialogue, like, “I bet Yasuke can move these crates”).
8.If you’re not in combat or in a restricted zone, you’ll automatically heal back to full health.
9.But you won’t automatically restore any usedrations(that’s Assassin’s Creed speak for “potions”). Instead, you’ll have to find those at shops or in ration-specific loot boxes.
10.Increasing your total ration capacity isn’t a matter of shopping or upgrading equipment but rather… finding a specific NPC. Who doesn’t show up on your map. Yes. Really.
11.The autosave? Surprisingly good, actually! In our testing,Shadowsseems to autosave every two to three minutes, and logs the five most recent autosaves. Between that and the seemingly limitless number of manual saves (on Xbox Series X, at least), you can really save-scum your way through this game if you’d like.
12.You can recruitcompanionsto fight by your side, and even though they map to ability prompts, they actually stick around in combat for a few moments.
13.Also, there’s technicallyromance, but only for a few characters (that we’ve found so far).
14.If you’re riding a horse or other mount, stick to the roads. The countryside ofShadowsis peppered with steep mountains, and the horse controls are already janky enough on flat terrain — no need to introduce a 45º pitch.
15.Actually, just stick to the roads anyway. You’ll stumble upon more shrines, temples, castles, side quests, Hidden Trails, Kofun, and other optional activities that way. Plus, if you try to run through the woods in a straight line to your destination, your screen is gonna look like this:
16.When you first enter a new province, take the time to unlock a bunch of the synchronization points (the eagle symbols). Those are your fast travel spots, and the more you’ve unlocked, the more time you’ll shave off the back-and-forth travel required for the main questline.
17.You can’t fast travel out of restricted areas like enemy bases, camps, and castles.
18.Synchronization points are considered combat-free zones — even if they’re in the middle of a restricted area — so you can always fast travel to and from them.
19.As soon as you can, get the Ascension Boost skill in Naoe’s Shinobi mastery tree. It dramatically increases Naoe’s climbing speed with the grappling hook, which is the fastest way to unlock new synchronization points.
20.Remember the Assassin’s Creed golden rule: If there’s paint on a wall, that means “CLIMB HERE.”
21.Your level determines your base stats (health, attack, defense, and so on). Your knowledge rank determines what tier of skill points you can unlock in mastery trees. Yourmastery pointsare used to unlock those skills.
22.Spend time hunting down knowledge points to expand how many skills you can unlock. Completing Horse Archery, Kata,Kuji-kiri, andLost Pagesare some of the fastest ways to getknowledge points.
23.But don’t worry too much about mastery points. You’ll get a bunch of them just by leveling up (though if you want more, start by attacking castles).
24.You can automatically transmog all of your gear from the start. And after you come across a weapon or armor set for the first time, it’s unlocked as a customization option permanently. In other words, you don’t need to keep it in your inventory.
25.At the start, sell your loot; don’t break it down. The currency, mon, is more valuable than the upgrade materials you get for dismantling weapons and armor.
26.Don’t bother trying to upgrade gear until you’re at least level 20. You cycle through so much gear in your early levels that anything you upgrade, you’ll likely replace in a few levels anyway.
27.There’s a suggested level for each province, and you should largely follow the provinces in order from lowest level to highest, but don’t worry about out-leveling any activities. Province levels will scale with you.
28.When exploring a Kofun (tomb), light the candles as you go. Not only does it help illuminate the space, maddeningly dim as it is, but it also helps you keep tabs on which tunnels you’ve already explored so you don’t end up going in circles.
29.Liberally use yourscoutsto reveal objectives. Though scouts seem like a limited resource, you can restore them quite effectively as needed.
30.Yes, you can pet the dog:
31.And the cat:
32.But watch out for the kitten!
33.To send you on your way with a note of sincerity, though, it’s this: Do not sleep on the Codex menu. As you exploreShadows, you’ll unlock Codex entries about various aspects of Japanese history. Each one is written up in elaborate detail, with many featuring scanned or photographed artworks from real-world museums. On paper, sure, Assassin’s Creed games might tell stories about stabbing — but the root here is and always has been about stories that actually happened. It’s easy to miss this aspect of the game, buried in a menu as it is, but in this regard,Shadowsis as sharp as Assassin’s Creed has ever been.
Just startingAssassin’s Creed Shadows? Beyond our fullAssassin’s Creed Shadowswalkthrough, here are explainers onhow long to beatthe game and when youunlock Yasuke, plus if you should playcanon,immersive, orguided explorationmodes.

"Half-Life: Alyx, VR’s first — and hopefully not last — killer app, turns 5",2025-03-19T15:21:30Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/542162/half-life-alyx-5th-anniversary-vr-pc,"Valve’s masterpiece still carries the platform on its back
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
New Half-Life games make me do stupid things. WhenHalf-Life 2came out on PC, I trekked to GameStop to trade in my Xbox, controllers, and games. I had hoped to score hundreds in trade-in credit, but the associate discovered my console was soft-modded and quartered the quote as a result — barely enough to cover the game. It didn’t run very well on my parents’ eMachines desktop (as a console player at the time, I didn’t know what recommended specs were). I was very sad when a port of the game eventually came to Xbox.
Half-Life: Alyxlaunched on March 23, 2020, nearly five years ago. I actually had a solid gaming PC that could run it. However, I didn’t have a VR headset, which is a necessary component. I immediatelyhadto have one, ideally a model that wouldn’t leave a $1,000 crater in my checking account likeValve’s Indexwould. I ended up buying a refurbishedOculus Riftfor $250 or so, and over the course of a memorable week, I beatAlyx, then promptly returned the headset for a refund while my jaw was still on the floor from its incredible finale.
It wasn’t long until I bought the wire-freeQuest 2later in 2020, another questionable financial decision, but I kept this one. Then I replayedAlyxthe way that it was meant to be experienced, which is with roomscale movement — no headset-tracking base stations required. I could kneel down, turn around, and just generally feel like I existed in the world, without concerns of tripping over a cable tethering me to my PC.
These hoops were worth jumping through forHalf-Life: Alyx, and those of you who’ve played it would likely agree. I haven’t played a VR game since with as much graphical polish, as much atmosphere, or as much consideration for different play styles and varying levels of comfort with VR mobility. It’s also the best-paced game I’ve played in VR; it’s the only title I’ve wanted to keep playing beyond my “oh, I don’t feel so good” threshold, which is somewhere around the 30-minute mark.
While the end goal of most of its encounters is to shoot bad guys and creatures with guns,Alyxoffers more open-endedness to encounters and to exploration in general. Once you clear a room, you can practice thwipping and throwing items with your gravity gloves, play the piano, or gawk at the stellar quality of theliquid shaders in bottlesbefore you smash them on the ground. You can open cabinets, fridges, and more, stacking each item you pull out realistically on top of the others. Why you would want to do that is beyond me (also, I did this), but the point is that youcoulddo it.Alyxput you in charge of how you spent your time in VR, not the other way around.
It’s trite to say this five years after launch, butHalf-Life: Alyxfelt like a door being kicked open, revealing what’s possible in VR. And, with the backing of one of gaming’s most beloved developers, I considered its release a possible turning point for VR tech going mainstream. I just really wanted everyone to be able to try it.
VR headset adoption has grown exponentially since 2020, thanks to Meta’s somewhat affordable Quest lineup of headsets. ThePlayStation VR 2can now be used on PCs, no longer exclusively tied to the PlayStation 5 (and it’s $200 less than it was at launch,costing $399.99). But since owning a powerful, costly gaming PC is the other part of the equation, that growth hasn’t made it all that much easier for more players to try games likeHalf-Life: Alyx. I wish Valve would port the game to PS5 so PSVR 2 owners could play it there. But since it hasn’t happened yet, more than two years after the headset’s launch, I’m not holding my breath. Maybe Valve is prepping a version of the game for its oft-rumored wire-free VR headset “Deckard” that our pals atThe Vergehave written about. Or maybe it’s not.
While there have been other great VR-only games sinceAlyx(Horizon Call of the Mountain, Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR, Batman: Arkham Shadow, to name a few that swung for the fences), the virtual reality segment has struggled to keep up the pace with new, must-play games. That’s sad, though it makes me treasureHalf-Life: Alyxeven more. It was a huge gamble to release the long-awaited prequel to one of the most influential games in virtual reality, requiring hardware that very few had then, and still very few have today. To that end, every developer making VR games is knowingly making a huge gamble that may not pan out in their favor.
Sure, I wish thatAlyx’s story could be played directly on consoles and PC so that more fans can play the game, but without gravity gloves, that would spoil all of the fun. When or if that’ll ever happen isn’t for us to decide. So, go ahead, do a stupid thing and buy a VR headset just so you can playHalf-Life: Alyx, even if you return it right after (I won’t tell). The game is just$17.99during the Steam Spring Sale, which lasts until March 20.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a gorgeous retread of tired RPG mechanics,2025-03-18T17:04:02Z,https://www.polygon.com/review/541609/assassins-creed-shadows-review,"The historic setting is fascinating and impressive, and I’m still left wanting more
byGrant Stoner
A shinobi deftly runs across several rooftops after swiftly assassinating several guards. She opens a large castle gate for reinforcements. A hulking samurai walks through, leaving behind a trail of bodies. The two climb up the castle stairs before being greeted by four samurai. They unsheathe their swords, offering me a choice of which character to enter the duel with. Naoe steps forward, her hidden blade extended, ready to meet its target.
Assassin’s Creed Shadowstakes the series through the late Sengoku period of Japan, set roughly between the 1570s and 1600 C.E., during the time in which Oda Nobunaga attempted to unify the nation and Japan saw an increase in Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries. Much like the duality of the historical setting,Shadowsis always playing with multiple themes throughout its story. Revenge, heartbreak, and even a sense of belonging and purpose are present in every mission. The narrative ofShadowsis its best feature, one that kept me engaged throughout my 35-hour play session, and one that will continue to draw me in as I finish the campaign.
Shadowshas players swap between the two main characters — Naoe, the assassin, and Yasuke, the samurai — but only after the first 10 hours or so, when you unlock Yasuke. Naoe’s story sees her coming to terms with her background as a member of the Iga clan, coupled with her understanding of her role in the Brotherhood, the secretive era-traversing assassin guild. Her journeys throughout Japan reflect the vastness of the nation’s cultural and political landscape. She is fierce and deadly, assassinating high-profile samurai while simultaneously learning how to exist beyond the fields of her home.
In one of my favorite missions, Naoe discovered the art of chanoyu, a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Players are required to fetch an ornate gift for the host of the ceremony, memorize proper cup placement when drinking, and even choose a formal kosode to wear. Every decision you make during this mission impacts your conversation with the others at the ceremony, the guests clearly discerning that Naoe is out of her element. She is so singularly focused on her goal of revenge that the intricacies of chanoyu fall to the wayside. And once she locates her target, she shifts out of her disguise and into her shinobi identity.
Yasuke is also quite literally the definition of an outsider. Arriving with the Jesuits, Yasuke quickly gains Nobunaga’s attention because of his race. Both true to the game and the historical figure, Yasuke was the first Black man in Japan, and the only Black man in history to achieve the rank of samurai. And his missions inShadowsreflect the duality of his life as a samurai and a foreigner. During a flashback in the game, Yasuke is sent to study under the same sensei that trained Nobunaga. Three students beat him and mock him for his large size and his inability to properly wield a sword. After training dutifully, he kills the three in a duel, winning the favor of Nobunaga and becoming one of his samurai and trusted advisers. And yet, he is still disrespected by several members of Nobunaga’s council for being an outsider.
Even the world ofShadowsfeeds into the themes of belonging. Naoe is all but ignored as she wanders through cities and villages. People pay no mind to her as she recruits companions to her cause or gathers information on targets. Her sense of place comes from trying to establish a new home with those equally impacted by the plight of war. Yasuke, on the other hand, is feared and revered as he travels. Random villagers will walk up to him and bow, or say his name in excited tones. One of my favorite things to do when discovering a new location was to swap between characters and compare the reactions of townsfolk. It brought the world to life, something that is often missing with protagonists in other Assassin’s Creed games. You’re always meant to be hidden, a nobody. But it’s disappointing to explore these prominent historical settings and not feel like you’re part of these moments.Shadowsrectifies that.
Unfortunately, my adoration withShadowsbegan to falter after the novelty of the story and the initial exploration elements wore off. At its core,Shadowsadheres to the same open-world role-playing game formula we’ve been exposed to sinceAssassin’s Creed Originsin 2017. Main missions and side objectives follow a predictable flow: Go to a general area in a region, locate intel or a person of interest, find and eliminate the target, then rinse and repeat. The gameplay loop is admittedly fun during the first 15 hours, as players are introduced to the differing ways in which Naoe and Yasuke play — Naoe as the traditional stealthy character in every Assassin’s Creed game, and Yasuke as a powerhouse that can overwhelm heavily armored opponents — but that novelty can’t mask the repetitive objectives. Even side storylines, which reveal themselves as you progress through the story and discover new regions, play out the same way as main missions.
I often felt forced to complete side quests just to level up and get better gear because I didn’t want to be underleveled. However, this meant exposing myself to theexactgameplay sequence I just spent hours completing. For example, each castle has a select number of daimyo (samurai) to eliminate before collecting legendary loot. And they look and play exactly the same at every single castle you visit. While some side quests beautifully weave in Japanese history and folklore, like the hunt for yokai (spirits from folklore), there is no deviation in the way they’re completed. The design and development choices feel far more invested in ensuring accurate Japanese historical and cultural representation than in weaving entertaining gameplay throughout. Learning about the culture and time period is definitely a plus, but the setting can only do so much to draw me in before I’m inevitably bored.
Even the exploration of Japan is repetitive. While I loved interacting with the environment and encountering wild animals to paint through sumi-e, finding new sensei to train my skills through kata, and navigating through kofun (tombs) and Hidden Trails, they don’t do enough to level up your character.
Activities like discovering lost scrolls in temples, praying at various shrines, and looting castles are all introduced within the first several hours, and nothing about them changes. If you successfully loot one castle, you’ve essentially looted them all. But because they have legendary gear, precious materials for upgrading your hideout, and large amounts of experience points as rewards, you’re expected to continuously loot them as you progress. This is by far my biggest complaint withShadows. The RPG elements force you to play through repetitive side missions just to level up and complete main missions. It was unique withOrigins, but roughly eight years later, I find myself longing for a traditional, relatively linear Assassin’s Creed game.
These issues are compounded with the game’s perplexing accessibility. Ubisoft is known to regularly champion accessible features and inclusive design practices with its games, andShadowsis no exception. With options like Guaranteed Assassination, audio cues for mechanics like traversal and combat, and Auto Movement,Shadowsis an example of what players have come to expect with modern accessible titles. Even the combat is inclusive through the simplistic and accessible design, allowing me to play for long hours. However, the limitations of customizable controls on Windows PC left me frustrated and physically exhausted.
While it’s possible to customize every input, even stacking actions on the same button or key, the remapped inputs don’t always register, and they occasionally override each other. With my limited reach, I can access approximately nine mouse buttons and keyboard keys. I often require games to let me bind actions to the same key, likeEscape from Tarkovdoes.Shadowsdoestechnicallyenable this, as my grappling hook and assassination are bound to the same key, as well as interact and swap weapons — but no other functions behave this way. I’ve tried combining other inputs to the same keys with little success, and I can’t discern why some combinations work and others don’t.
These difficulties force me to use a virtual keyboard to make up for the lack of available buttons and keys, but even the virtual keyboard doesn’t properly function within the game. With every click, the game registers me attacking first before applying the desired input. For example, pressing H lets me heal, but my character always swings their weapon before the heal is applied. This isn’t necessarily an issue during combat, but can be problematic when I’m trying to remain hidden in the bushes or on top of rooftops. This even affects aspects like changing equipment. You are unable to change equipment when performinganyaction, and to open my inventory, I need to press I with the virtual keyboard. The only way I can successfully change weapons or armor is by being in an area that locks the game out of combat, like in your hideout or on observation platforms. This forces me to either wait for a family member or friend to press the key, continue playing until I reach a new lookout spot, or fast-travel back to my hideout.
The virtual keyboard also impacts the act of summoning my mount. Since I need to click X to call my horse, the game always registers me attacking first. I have yet to properly ride a horseanywhere, forcing me to either fast-travel around the map or run to new locations, which can be thousands of meters away. I’ve added approximately three hours to my overall playtime just from running across the map, since I can’t access my horse. And while you can customize every key, every option I already have is crucial to playing the game, forcing me to leave some functions unavailable without the virtual keyboard.
Assassin’s Creed Shadowsexplores a setting I’ve wanted to explore for years. It’s always made sense to bring the series known for its hidden organizations and ninja-like aesthetics to feudal Japan. And while I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the setting and story, so much so that I will be rolling credits well after launch, it’s marred by open-world RPG mechanics that continue to plague modern Assassin’s Creed games with repetitiveness.

The second half of the month will see co-op action-roguelike33 Immortalsenter early access, not to mention expansive role-playing gameOctopath Traveler 2(joining Game Pass Standard), the old-school bundleBlizzard Arcade Collection, another day-one drop inAtomfall, and modern classicsBatman: Arkham KnightandTunicfor those content to stick with the basic Xbox Game Pass Core subscription. Here’s the full list:
Xbox Game Pass is also losing a bunch of games on March 24, listed below. If you’re wondering what you should play before then, you can never go wrong withaYakuzagame, especiallyLike a Dragon, which is probably one of the best turn-based role-playing games of the last decade. I’d also be remiss if I didn’t recommendMonster Hunter Rise, which is a more traditional entry in the long-running series than the recently releasedMonster Hunter Wilds.

Famitsu readers still yearn for Pragmata despite its indefinite delay,2025-03-17T19:17:44Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/541217/pragmata-capcom-famitsu-most-wanted-deep-down,"Is this just another Deep Down?
byIan Walker
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
In thelatest issueofWeekly Famitsu, a poll listsPragmataas the magazine readership’s third most wanted game despite its indefinite delayalmost two years ago.
Pragmatareceived 466 votes, pushing it past big names likeMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater,Pokémon Legends: Z-A, andMetroid Prime 4: Beyond, all of which actually look like they may release within the next year. And this isn’t a one-off or fluke, either. Sinceits revealin 2020,Pragmatahas been a consistent figure in theseFamitsureader polls and in recent years has frequently ranked within the top three. In fact, you have to go all the way back toSeptember 2023to find an issue of the magazine where it wasn’t one of the 10 most wanted games.
While the numbers are surprising, they don’t provide much context. We’ve seen just brief flashes ofPragamataover the last five years thanks to some pretty cinematics and brief snippets of gameplay, so it’s hard to understand exactly what Famitsu readers find so exciting. I’ll admit to being intrigued by the game after its reveal, but its rocky history has relegated it in my mind to the same place asDeep Down, another cool-looking Capcom project that garnered a lot of attention but never saw the light of day.
As it stands, much of what we know aboutPragmatacomes from official Capcom marketing copy, which describes the game as “an all-new action adventure title that depicts a near-future dystopian world on the moon through a deeply profound story and setting,” descriptions which are echoed on thePlayStationandXboxstores.
Pragmatawas delayed from 2022 to 2023just six months after its revealbefore being removed from Capcom’s release calendar altogetherin 2023.
“It is with a heavy heart that we must further postpone the release ofPragmata,” the development team said at the time. “Our team is currently hard at work making the best game that we possibly can, but we need more time. We will continue to do our best to ensure that the final product is one that is worthy of your patience.”
IsPragmatajust anotherDeep Down, or might it make a return à la Fumito Ueda’sThe Last Guardianand surprise even its most stalwart supporters? Is Capcom maybe holding out for a next generation release? It’s hard to say with any certainty, but what is clear is thatPragmatamade a huge impression on the gaming public, and it would be a shame for Capcom to squander that kind of lasting excitement again.

Bring back the 2000s-era sci-fi flopbuster,2025-03-17T11:23:36Z,https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/538538/best-2000s-sci-fi-blockbuster-bombs-flops,"The 2000s were a wonderful time for movies, good and weird
byAusten GoslinandPete Volk
Toussaint Egan
We didn’t know how good we had it in the 2000s. Sure, some things were awful, but the movie industry was something special. Every year felt like it held something new and fantastic: the Bourne movies,Avatar,Gladiator, Lord of the Rings,Pan’s Labyrinth,Lost in Translation,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, andMulholland Drive, just to name a random handful. On top of that,There Will Be Blood,Michael Clayton,Atonement,Juno, andNo Country for Old Menwere going head to head at the Oscars. And as far as the eye could see, studios were funding ridiculously ambitious, ill-fated sci-fi blockbusters that no one really bothered to watch until they hit cable.
These movies arrived at the perfect moment to be fascinating without necessarily being all that good. Hollywood was ready to spend loads of money on original ideas, and afterThe MatrixandStar Wars: The Phantom Menace, sci-fi was having a moment. So, inspired by those movies, and smaller, more manageable examples like Alex Proyas’Dark CityandThe Crow, directors set out to make their sci-fi dreams a reality. The only problem was that CGI was nowhere near advanced enough for the worlds these creators wanted to build, especially not at the budgets they wanted to build them at. So, an entire microgenre of unashamed, strange blockbusters was born, with high aims, moderate budgets, buckets of creativity, a bit of star power to get the green light from studios, and only the loosest semblance of a script to hold it all together.
The recent release ofPaul W.S. Anderson’s tremendously fun filmIn the Lost Landsfelt like a perfect throwback to that era, with its complex mythology of a Christian cult and a ruined world full of magic — made up mostly of brown and gray CGI and anonymous metal beams. Anderson is a master of this particular type of movie (though audiences generally showed up for his Resident Evil movies), and his latest got us thinking with fond nostalgia on this bygone era of bizarre and unique movies.
In that spirit, we put together a list of some of the very best of the 2000s’ (and early 2010s’) overly ambitious sci-fi movies, each one of which bombed — commercially, critically, or both. Despite their failings, though, the “flopbusters” on this list have stuck in our heads and hearts for nearly 20 years, and that alone is a feat worth celebrating.
Most 2000s thing about it:Ice Cube’s character is named “Desolation Williams.”Where to watch:Free with ads on the Roku Channel, or for digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Fandango
All of John Carpenter’s movies have a delightful B-movie flair to them. ButGhosts of Marstakes the cake in the category. It’s a pseudo-Western on Mars with an all-star cast, including Ice Cube, Pam Grier, and frequent flopbuster star Jason Statham.
The premise is great and allows for a lot of Carpenter narrative creativity: When a freight train on a mission to pick up a prisoner (Ice Cube) returns with only one survivor (Natasha Henstridge), she is interrogated about the series of events, unfolding through a series of interweaving flashbacks.
The performances are strong, and Carpenter scores the movie well as always, but the real strength ofGhosts of Marsis right there in the title. The Martian atmosphere is extremely spooky, and the red tones of the planet’s surface are gorgeous, an effect created by dyeing the gypsum mine they filmed in with red coloring. —Pete Volk
Most 2000s thing about it:Gun Kata.Where to watch:Free on Hoopla, or for digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Fandango
This entire trend in Hollywood owes its life, and its budgets, toThe Matrix, but few movies on this list took that inspiration as seriously asEquilibrium. The movie is a pretty blatant rip-off, but I say that with nothing but love in my heart for it.Equilibriumtakes place shortly after the end of World War III, in a city where emotion and art have been outlawed entirely. However, when John Preston (Christian Bale) suddenly finds a book of poems by W.B. Yeats, he discovers his own emotions and decides to fight back against and destroy the fascist government that has stripped people of the ability to feel.
To do all this rebelling, Preston has to call upon his mastery ofEquilibrium’s most incredible invention: Gun Kata, a gun-based martial art that is equal parts extremely silly and totally sick. All ofEquilibrium’s shootouts and fights scenes involve Preston pulling off incredible feats with guns, doingMatrix-style wire work while shooting dozens of rounds a second out of his semiautomatic pistols, or beating people to death with retractable gun spikes. It’s all bizarre and incredible, and in certain ways feels like a precursor to the John Wick style that dominates action movies today. The exceptionally ridiculous Gun Kata action, combined with one of the bigger and more well-thought-out worlds on this list, makesEquilibriuman absolute flopbuster classic. —Austen Goslin
Most 2000s thing about it:Matt Damonturned downthe lead part because he had just done an amnesia role withThe Bourne Identity.Where to watch:For digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Fandango
Even many of my fellowJohn Woodie-hards won’t go to bat for this one. The movie that led to Woo’s temporary exile from Hollywood filmmaking,Paycheckis based on a Philip K. Dick story and follows a highly skilled engineer (Ben Affleck) whose work is so secretive that he gets his short-term memory wiped after every job. But when a job goes wrong, he has to try and retrace his own (forgotten) steps to get to the bottom of a mystery.
I remember seeing this movie for the first time on cable when I was in high school, and I fully believe that’s the best way to watchPaycheck(on TV, with commercials… high school might be harder to recreate). And yes, it does have one of John Woo’s trademark doves. —PV
Most 2000s thing about it:The fact that the best version of the character only exists in theXbox tie-in game.Where to watch:Prime Video or Starz
Perhaps the best example of this trend,The Chronicles of Riddickis a sequel toPitch Black, a wonderful sci-fi slasher that’s something likeAlien, except if the xenomorph was played by Vin Diesel and he was sort of a good guy. But while the first movie is low-stakes and even lower-budget, the second movie blows the whole thing out to a universal scale.
While we last saw him as a space outlaw on a backwater planet, when we next catch up with Richard B. Riddick, he’s pulled into a conflict with an intergalactic empire. The series pulls off its turn toward space opera surprisingly well, building out a whole spacefaring civilization that feels straight out of Warhammer 40K, complete with massive armor and weapons, a giant capital city, and incredibly convoluted lore. All of this is presented with a terrific blend of seriousness and camp, and while Riddick caring this much about the fate of the universe never quite makes sense, it is one of the most entertaining examples of Hollywood’s sci-fi excess you can find. —AG
Most 2000s thing about it:Roger Ebert called it “an assault on all the senses, including common.”Where to watch:Max, or for digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Fandango
If there’s anything that makes more sense than video games as Paul W.S. Anderson adaptation material, it’s a Roger Corman movie. The 2008Death Raceupdates the great premise of Corman’s cult classic — prisoners compete in a deadly race to try and earn their freedom — and amplifies the vehicular action with some terrific car stunts and flips. You will truly feel the presence of Hollywood car action maestro Spiro Razatos, best known for his work on the Fast and Furious franchise.
So many of Anderson’s movies would fit in this category: the (very good!) Resident Evil movies,Alien vs. Predator, andeven some of his newer moviesthat don’t belong to this specific era. A key element of the mid-2000s flopbuster is a lack of embarrassment over the nerdy stuff in the material, and throughout his decades making video game adaptations and other seemingly silly projects, Anderson has never once flinched. He knows what you’re here for, he knows what he’s here for, and he delivers.
All the 2000s flopbuster notes are here: plenty of CGIto build out the largely gray environments of the prison and the racetrack(but also for some grisly deaths), a villain whose plan makes no sense and whose motivations seem to flip on a dime, and a goofy, violent, fun time in a surprisingly well-realized dystopia. —PV
Most 2000s thing about it:The villain dresses like The Prodigy’s Keith Flint with a big ol’ biohazard symbol tattooed on his back.Where to watch:For digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, YouTube
If your idea of a good time is listening to Malcolm McDowell ominously monologuing over a faux-John Carpenter synth score and post-apocalyptic motorbike rallies that function like Burning Man meets Cirque du Soleil, then boy, do I have a movie for you!Doomsdaywas critically panned when it was released back in ’08 as a derivative and uninspired riff onMad MaxandEscape from New York. And while this is true, it does very little to detract from its appeal as a damn satisfying, albeit very cheesy, action movie.
Rhona Mitra kicks all kinds of ass as Major Eden Sinclair, a special ops soldier with a drone camera for an eye who is sent on a mission into a quarantined Scotland in search of a cure for a deadly super virus. Don’t focus too much on the plot. Instead, just soak in the gloriously over-the-top violence, gladiatorial spectacle, and at times shockingly striking cinematography and lighting. Hell, the climax even essentially boils down to an all-out road war, complete with leather-bound, man-eating ravers and slow-motion explosions. What’s not to like? —Toussaint Egan
Most 2000s thing about it:Action/horror vampires.Where to watch:Free with ads on The Roku Channel or on the CW app, or for digital rental/purchase on Amazon or Apple TV
Vampires were all the rage in the 2000s, and while it’s tempting to credit Twilight with the whole thing, it’s important to remember that it really started withBladein 1998, then the Underworld movies (which would be on this list had they not made as much money and as many sequels as they did) kept the bloodsuckers alive long enough for Bella and Edward to give them a second life. Amid all of that, though, were half a dozen or so smaller vampire movies of various genres. But not a single one of the vampire movies from this era was as big or bold asDaybreakers.
Daybreakerstakes place in a post-apocalyptic world ruled by vampires. Ethan Hawke plays a vampire hematologist who’s trying to solve for the fact that now that vampires rule the world, the world’s running out of blood to drink. In the middle of his research, he comes across a former vampire named Elvis (Willem Dafoe), who thinks he has a cure for vampirism that could save humanity, and maybe the vampires, too. From there, the movie turns into a pretty great little action thriller in a fascinatingly drawn world. ThinkChildren of Men(a movie that could also be on this list but is simply a little too good for it) but with vampires and Willem Dafoe. —AG
Most 2000s thing about it:The Neveldine/Taylor style of chaos cinema editing.Where to watch:Peacock, or for free with ads on Pluto TV
During their six years making movies together, onetime filmmaking duo Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor made some of the most chaotically shot and edited movies of the century. This is a good thing: The Crank movies, their Ghost Rider sequel, andGamerare all among the most visually distinct movies of their generation, with a palpable energy underneath the frantic editing style.
In this one, prisoners on death row compete in a third-person shooter where they are the characters, controlled by gamers behind the scenes. The most popular and successful prisoner in this game (Gerard Butler) works alongside the teenager controlling him (Logan Lerman) to attempt to gain his freedom.Gamerwas also ahead of its time when it comes to itssatire of people’s time in virtual worlds, and features a delightfully over-the-top villain performance from mid-Dexter-era Michael C. Hall (that casting choice is a runner-up for most 2000s thing aboutGamer). —PV
Most 2000s thing about it:A band of militant post-apocalyptic priests who are the good guys (also action/horror vampires).Where to watch:USA Network, or for digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Fandango
Perhaps the wildest movie on this whole list,Priestis going to take some explaining. The movie is set in a world where humans and vampires spent hundreds of years at war, almost completely destroying the Earth’s surface. Finally, humans banded together in a theocratic society under the rule of The Church, which creates a specially trained group of warriors called Priests who can defeat the vampires.
When they do defeat the vampires, The Church rounds up the surviving monsters and puts them in special reservations, but then immediately begins to enact tyrannical totalitarian control over the remaining humans. To escape this, many humans move outside the safety of The Church’s walled city, where they’re more susceptible to bands of roaming vampire survivors. Living outside the walls long after the end of the last war, one particular Priest (Paul Bettany) finds his niece has been kidnapped by vampires, and he has to cross the post-apocalyptic landscape — mostly made out of gray CGI slop — to return to his vampire-killing ways. It’s among the most ambitious and fun premises on this list, and it mostly results in an excuse for some pretty kick-ass vampire-killing action, all of which makes this an excellent addition to the flopbuster canon. —AG
Most 2000s thing about it:A soundtrack consisting entirely of industrial music.Where to watch:Max, or for digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Fandango
Another update of an existing franchise, the 2012Dreddis a crisp sci-fi action movie equal partsThe Raid(which happened to shoot almost simultaneously) and ’80s sci-fi throwback. Karl Urban stars as the violent Judge Dredd, on an assignment with his rookie partner (Olivia Thirlby) to take down a drug kingpin (mid-Game of ThronesLena Headey, another strong casting-from-TV choice in this era that also qualifies as a runner-up for most 2000s thing about this movie) who rules over a skyscraping high-rise.
The verticality in the 200-story building allows for tense and at times shockingly violent action augmented by the visual effects (especially the slow-motion sequences), and the lead performances are all strong. There are plenty of gray tones within the movie, fitting with the era, but the kinetic direction and strong performances hold it all together. Of note: Pete Travis is credited with directing the movie, butUrban has made it clear screenwriter Alex Garland is the one who really directedDredd. —PV

Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the other new games out this week,2025-03-14T23:00:10Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/537669/best-new-game-releases-march-17-assassins-creed-shadows,"This week’s games branch out in some new directions
byTyler Colp
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
The new game releases this week may look a little familiar, but all of them attempt to push their genres or series in new directions. We’ve got a dark game about a plague outbreak where you’re finally a certified doctor instead of someone taking up the job out of necessity; a 33-player action game with large-scale battles that resemble raid fights in an MMO; and a baseball game with — wait for it — a roguelike board game mode.
Oh, and there’sAssassin’s Creed Shadowsat the end of the week, with a story set in feudal Japan and a whole base-building system. But that will come afterPathologic 3, which starts the week off with another macabre story of death and decay. Then there’s33 Immortals, a game where you join up with a whole legion of players trying to survive against hordes of monsters.MLB The Show 25promises a bunch of new additions to the series, including that roguelike board game mode. And if sports aren’t for you,Reignbreakeris a game that mixes medieval weaponry with a bit of cyberpunk. It argues that your everyday javelins haven’t gone far enough and introduces “motorized” javelins that explode and launch across the screen like a bullet.
Here are our most anticipated game releases for the week of March 17.
Release date:March 17Platforms:Windows PCA plague has festered in a small town and you’re on the hunt for immortality in this narrative-focused game. With the help of some time travel, you have to do everything you can as a local healer to keep the town from being swallowed whole.
Release date:March 18Platforms:Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis is a co-op action roguelike where 33 players pour onto the battlefield and try to survive against God’s armies of monsters. Battles are modeled after MMO raid fights and require you to rally everyone together to overcome them.
Release date:March 18 (early access March 14)Platforms:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series XThe only major MLB simulation franchise returns with a new year, three new cover athletes, and a lot of new features.Fielding has been revamped, the Road to the Show mode now starts in high school, and Diamond Dynasty has a new roguelike game mode that I can’t wait to dig into. —Pete Volk
Release date:March 18Platforms:Windows PCI’m pretty sure this roguelike action game invented the sequel to javelins. They’re called motorized javelins and they spin, explode, and skewer the robotic monsters chasing you in every level. Put down your swords and your hammers; it’s time for the javelins.
Release date:March 20Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XAssassin’s Creed finally makes its way to feudal Japan. The story is split between two characters this time: Naoe is an assassin and Yasuke is a samurai. You get to recruit a whole network of spies and build a hideout like it was The Sims. This game has it all.
Release date:March 20Platforms:Windows PCSome call it “full-contact” racing, but really it’s racing where the cars smash into each other. This game is entirely built for that, with tons of customization and a whole physics engine made to simulate what happens when metal slams into metal. Now, wrecking your car isn’t necessarily the best way to win a race, but it’s certainly the most fun.

10 cozy games that hide a secret twist,2025-03-14T20:51:49Z,https://www.polygon.com/cozy-gaming/539022/best-cozy-games-twist-play-list,"Cozy gaming is great, and these games add something new to the formula
byCass Marshall
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
It’s nice to be cozy. I’m a huge fan of being wrapped up in a big blanket, sipping hot chocolate, and leisurely walks under colorful autumn trees. Cozy games are also great, and they’re an increasingly popular genre. While I’ve spent hours preparing the perfect farm inStardew Valleyor exploring Bahari Bay inPalia, it can be fun to subvert the genre and play a cozy game with a twist on the formula.
These games are still cozy, but there’s something else added to make things a little uncomfortable, uneasy, or unpredictable. These games might have a greater message or a threat hidden amid its soothing, comfy vibes. A garnish of anxiety, fear, or danger can elevate the rest of the game’s cozy elements, making for a great experience all the way through.
Where to play:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XWanderstopis a game about an adventurer named Alta who falters in battle and finds herself working at a humble tea shop instead. Alta gathers the herbs to create tea, boils pots of water, and chats with customers. There are no registers, no tips, no cash exchanges — tea shop owner Boro isn’t running a commercial business, but making a tea shop for his community out of sheer love of the game. There’s plenty of cozy to be found in Alta’s routine of gathering leaves and setting them out to dry. It’s also fun to sit for tea with Boro and decorate the shop. But at its heartWanderstopis a story about burnout, recovery, and healing.
Where to play:Windows PCInCrime Scene Cleaner, I play a hardworking man picking up some extra work from the mob. I don’t carry out wet work myself, but I show up afterward to clean things up. It’s easy to fall into a soothing rhythm of mopping floors, pressure-washing walls, and shoving broken glass or bullet casings into the trash. It’s certainly a little macabre to haul dead bodies out to the truck and clean up the blood splatter, but it’s easy to fall into a rhythm. The tone of the game is more silly than morbid, and if you enjoyPowerWash SimulatororHouse Flipper, you’ll likely enjoy this one too.
Where to play:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XWhat could be more relaxing than sailing a little boat across the harbor, catching fish, and selling them to the friendly locals? Just make sure you don’t sail at night, or investigate any of the mysterious incidents that keep cropping up around the remote archipelago known as The Marrows.Dredgeis wonderfully creepy and calming in turns, and the more the player scratches at the surface, the more Lovecraftian mystery there is to discover.
Where to play:Mac, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox OneOK, hear me out on this one.RimWorld is notorious for being a difficult survival simulatorwhere the player is forced into making morally compromised choices, but there are also periods of peace and stability. The player controls a sci-fi colony, slowly building a few survivors into an actual settlement. The game is a story simulator, so the colony is affected by random events — a psychic drone may cause mental stress on all male colonists, a raider band might strike in the night, or a bad wound could develop an infection and kill a crucial player. Luckily,RimWorldoffers robust settings, allowing the player to either embrace the chaos and random chance or turn things way down and simply enjoy watching their civilization grow and prosper.
Where to play:Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XInCult of the Lamb, you play as the titular lamb as they battle against oppressive gods and build their own cult from the ground up. I cannot stress enough that the art style for this game is adorable, capable of inspiring someone to go “Aww!” even as they sacrifice a little frog guy to their dark cause. While the roguelike dungeon crawls are fun, the real meat of the game lies in the cult management mechanics. Players will have to keep their followers safe, free from illness, and engaged in the collective faith. It’s up to you how you achieve that goal — or choose to delve into wanton sacrifice and slaughter.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox OneTo the untrained eye, one might think the scary part ofGraveyard Keeperis the plethora of skeletons. Actually, it’s the fact that the game is a riff on capitalism. The player takes control of a medieval graveyard, expanding their grounds and improving their services over time. This job is further complicated by dungeon dives, alchemical breakthroughs, and resource management. It’s a genuinely funny little game that also presents challenging choices that will test your sense of ethics.
Where to play:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XTeamwork makes the dream work, and there’s no partner you can trust like your spouse. InRavenous Devils, the player controls both husband and wife as they settle into a new life together with a new tailor shop/bakery combination business. Percival works upstairs, while Hildred bakes and serves customers. I mean that quite literally, as the duo have found a cheap way to figure out supplies. Percival murders customers, Hildred slaughters them, and both businesses benefit from the influx of cheap clothes and meat. It’s a dark twist on an otherwise delightful cooking game, especially since the police can check Percival’s shop for any evidence of his many murders.
Where to play:iOS, Mac, Nintendo Switch, Windows PCWith its colorful palette, mobile game-style graphics, and cheerful premise, it’s easy to seeWylde Flowersas a simple and shallow game. However, once protagonist Tara settles into her cottagecore home and begins training as a witch, she discovers a disturbing thread that leads to unsettling revelations. While the game remains relatively lighthearted, there are some fun mysteries and creepy cultlike incidents to investigate.
Where to Play:Windows PCGrave Seasonsis an upcoming life simulator game where the protagonist is a recent escapee from jail, settling down for a new life in the humble little town of Ashenridge. From there, the player can mine, fish, chat with townsfolk, and settle into their new life. There’s just one big problem: One of those friendly villagers is a murderer, and there’s something strange and supernatural about Ashenridge. Developer Perfect Garbage has partnered with Blumhouse Games, and while there’s no release date, the premise of the game is extremely intriguing.
Where to play:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XSome people find the act of disassembling and organizing a big project to be meditative, andHardspace: Shipbreakeris a fantastic example of this. Yes, the wrong move could lead to an explosive result, and it’s possible to die in some truly terrible ways. But with the right settings, I find it relaxing to simply cut through hulls, tear ships apart, and watch numbers go up as I perfect my technique. There’s still a massive debt hanging over my head, and lots of commentary on capitalism, but I can’t help but find pleasure in a job well done and a ship stripped down for parts.

Silent Hill is back in a big way.Silent Hill fbuilds on the momentum of the phenomenalSilent Hill 2remakeby charting new territory for the horror franchise.

Silent Hill f, the first main-series entry in over a decade, is still on its way. Konami hasn’t mentioned it forquite some time, but anew trailershown during aSilent Hill Transmission streamon Thursday confirms it’s still very real.
The new trailer, which borrows imagery from what we saw of the game inthe first trailer, follows a young girl living in a small Japanese town during the 1960s — a first for the series. Fog engulfs the town and the girl starts to see flowers before running into a shambling woman. More monsters show up and we see the girl picking up a pipe to defend herself against something off-screen, with a spore-covered house behind her.
Silent Hill fis being developed by a Taiwan-based studio named NeoBards Entertainment with help from Japanese developers. The stream had more details on the game’s production, with appearances from writer Ryukishi07 and character and creature designer Kera. On the stream, Konami dug into its setting and how it used reference photos and sounds to help create the game’s rural town, and discussed the psychological themes it wants to explore with its young protagonist.

PowerWash Simulator 2 looks like the cleaning sim we all crave,2025-03-13T17:25:11Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/539160/powerwash-simulator-2-announcemement-trailer,"I hope you like your soap improved and clingy
byCass Marshall
PowerWash Simulatoris a surprisingly cozy game, giving the player a pressure washer and a truly grimy and grubby environment to clean up. The game has been so successful that there are crossovers with other pop culture titans, likeWarhammer 40,000orTomb Raider. On Thursday, developer FuturLab announced a self-published sequel with improved visuals, a new campaign, and new hygienic gadgets to try. The game is expected to be released later this year on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox.
FuturLab released a short teaser trailer for the game, which doesn’t show too much in the way of new features, but it looks like the game will have all the satisfying spray action we have come to expect from the predecessor. What’s really exciting is the addition of split-screen multiplayer, so contractors can play with pals in person or online.
“The original game’s design was all about eliminating anything that detracted from the pure satisfaction of taking something dirty and making it clean.PowerWash Simulator 2is all about adding in even more avenues for players to achieve that same sense of satisfaction, with new tools, features and quality of life improvements,” says Dan Chequer, Design Director at FuturLab, in a press release.
Players will get to see more of Muckingham, the original game’s setting, as well as travel out to places like Sponge Valley, Power Falls, and Lubri City. The press release also promises more effective soap, shared campaign progress online, and a customizable home base. While no release date was announced, FuturLab is expected to share more information in April.

Microsoft’s Copilot for Gaming preview leaves us with more questions than it answers,2025-03-13T17:01:57Z,https://www.polygon.com/xbox/539015/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming-minecraft-ai-artificial-intelligence-openai,"How often does it just tell you to ‘git gud’?
byIan Walker
Microsoft is preparing to add “artificial intelligence” — acomplete misnomerthat everyone continues to use nonetheless — to its video game platforms via the upcoming Copilot for Gaming program. An “early preview” is coming to mobile for Xbox Insiders soon, but we got ourfirst lookat how the gameplay assistant may function on the March 13 episode of The Official Xbox Podcast.
“This AI-driven sidekick is designed to be your personalized gaming companion, helping you get to your favorite games faster, coaching you to improve your skills, and connecting you better with your friends and communities,” Jeff Rubenstein, director of Xbox editorial, explained on Xbox Wire. “Copilot for Gaming will be there when you need it but out of the way if you don’t.”
A couple of the proof-of-concept Copilot for Gaming examples shown on The Official Xbox Podcast include suggesting items to create inMinecraftbased on what’s in the player’s inventory and providing an on-screen strategy guide for defeating a siege engine inAge of Empires IV.
The big question mark about Copilot for Gaming — and really anything that presents itself as “artificial intelligence” — is how it’s getting its information and from where. This technology isn’t learning in any real sense, but simply acting as a personalized search engine sifting through the terabytes ofillicitly obtaineddata OpenAI uses to train its GPT-4 large language model. Copilot for Gaming could very well be pulling info from any number of guides from sites like Polygon, Kotaku, and IGN or even tips shared on Reddit, ResetEra, and GameFAQs.
It’s also hard to take Microsoft at its word that one of Copilot for Gaming’s goals is “connecting you better with your friends” when The Official Xbox Podcast host Ethan Rothamel eagerly envisions a future where he won’t have to help guide his mom, who picked up gaming during COVID, through levels ofHuman Fall Flatanymore. Why share any sort of connection with your loved ones, especially those not previously predisposed to gaming, when you can pawn them off on an AI assistant instead?
Polygon is in the process of asking Microsoft about these concerns and will report back when we learn more.

Bethesda’s Oblivion remake reportedly out by June,2025-03-13T14:19:40Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/538833/oblivion-remake-release-date-report,"And its announcement is imminent
byOli Welsh
A full remake of Bethesda’s classic 2006 role-playing gameThe Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivioncould be announced imminently — and could even be released within the next couple of months, according to new reports.
TheOblivionremake has long been rumored, and was included in alist of Bethesda projectsdating back to 2020. That list leaked in 2023 when the Microsoft presentation it formed part of was included in leaked court documents.
Now NatetheHate, a well-connected insider,has saidthe game will be announced in March or April, and released “likely sooner than the original June target.”VGC corroborated this reportand went a step further, suggesting the game could be released as early as April.
Various reports have suggested theOblivionremake is being developed, at least in part, by Virtuos, which is currently assisting Konami with development ofMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a remake ofMetal Gear Solid 3.
According to a recent report byMP1st, citing a leak by a former Virtuos employee,Oblivionhas been fully remade in Unreal Engine 5, and the new version of the game substantially overhauls several gameplay systems, including stamina, sneaking, blocking, and archery. Blocking is supposedly inspired by Soulslike games, while the stamina system is reportedly more lenient in combat encounters.
Oblivionwas a hit when it was released on Windows PC and Xbox 360 in 2006, bringing the Elder Scrolls series to a wider audience and setting Bethesda Game Studios up for the supernova success ofFallout 3in 2008 andThe Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrimin 2011. In the continuing absence of even the smallest morsel of information aboutThe Elder Scrolls 6, a chance to revisit Cyrodiil would be most welcome.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows will support Steam Deck after all,2025-03-13T13:30:20Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/538818/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-deck-support,"Ubisoft previously said Valve’s handheld wasn’t powerful enough
byOli Welsh
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Ubisoft has announced thatAssassin’s Creed Shadowswill be supported on Steam Deck at launch, despite previously saying that Valve’s handheld was not powerful enough to run the upcoming blockbuster.
In aposton the official Assassin’s Creed X (formerly Twitter) account, Ubisoft said, “Many of you have been asking about Steam Deck. We are happy to say that we are supporting Steam Deck at launch and are currently awaiting the level of classification from Valve. More info to come soon.”
By “level of classification,” Ubisoft is referring to whether Valve will tag the game as Verified or merely Playable on the handheld. To attain Verified status, games must run well on default settings, plus have controls and an interface that are well configured for the device. But Ubisoft seems confident enough to make Steam Deck support official.
It’s a surprising move, because as little as a month ago,Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ technology director Pierre Fsaid in a tech Q&Athat the game “will not be compatible with Steam Deck, due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC.”
Assassin’s Creed Shadowsis very much a cutting-edge, AAA production. It is not being released on last-generation consoles and thePC system requirementsdon’t even allow for ray tracing to be turned off. Getting it running well on the capable but relatively humble Steam Deck will not be an easy feat for Ubisoft’s engineers.
Until recently, the Steam Deck has been able to keep up with most recent releases. But this deep into the console generation, with support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One becoming a rarity, the three-year-old device is struggling to run new releases likeMonster Hunter Wilds— and it’s questionable whether it has a big enough user base for developers to actively support it. In that context, Ubisoft’s decision to support the device withAssassin’s Creed Shadowsis laudable, if not brave. It will be interesting to see how well the game performs on Steam Deck.

"Fielding may not be fun, but it could be more rewarding in MLB The Show 25’s career mode",2025-03-12T13:27:50Z,https://www.polygon.com/sports-games/538047/mlb-the-show-25-fielding-rtts-preview,"Defense wins championships, which the 2024 Yankees found out the hard way
bySamit Sarkar
Fielding is perhaps the unsung hero of every baseball video game. There probably aren’t many MLB The Show players who ask themselves, upon first firing up the new game each year,What’s new on defense?But of course, it’s just as important a pillar of the sport as pitching, hitting, or baserunning — as my beloved Yankees found out when they frittered away a five-run lead in Game 5 of the 2024 World Series, in what is perhapsthe most mind-boggling, soul-crushing, Lemony-Snicket-ain’t-got-shit-on-this collapsein the 120-year history of the Fall Classic.
MLB The Show has now existed as a video game franchise for just about one-sixth of that time period — it began with 2006’sMLB 06: The Show, making this year’sMLB The Show 25the 20th entry in the series — and for its entire run, the same person has led the gameplay team at developer SIE San Diego Studio. That has made the franchise a renowned model of consistency, but it also presents some challenges. Namely: With such a well-established, solid foundation, are you forever stuck tinkering on the margins?
“Every year, we’ll say, ‘Oh, we’ve added hundreds of new gameplay animations.’ And people will say, ‘Well, the game looks the same,’” said Sony’s Ramone Russell, director of product development, communications, and brand strategy at Sony San Diego, in an interview with me last month. These players are not entirely wrong, of course — when an annual sports game gets a few hundred items added to an animation library that numbers in the tens of thousands, players will likely need to spend a significant amount of time on the virtual diamond before their eyes catch something they’ve never seen before.
Part of the trouble when it comes to representing fielding in a video game is not just that it’s tough to make it as fun and engaging as pitching or hitting. It’s also difficult to convey the differences in skill between a league-average defender and a Gold Glove winner, at least in a way that doesn’t simply annoy players. In order to do that, the developers have to take some controloutof players’ hands. Russell said there’s effectively a dice roll under the hood, based on certain in-game attributes that each fielder possesses, that helps determine how likely it is that any given player will be able to get to a particular batted ball. (Cue MLB The Show players wailing at their TVs when a seeing-eye grounder trickles into the outfield, just out of a defender’s reach.)
This is actually a change that Sony San Diego made forMLB The Show 24last year, but the game didn’t communicate it to players in any way. Now there’s a visual indicator of how good a jump your infielder got on a ball: blue for the fastest reaction time, green for an average one, and yellow for the slowest. The gameplay connection here is that the fielding animation you see corresponds to the reaction time. Even if three shortstops with varying skill levels can each get to the same hypothetical ground ball, an elite defender will be able to field it more cleanly than the others, and transition to a throwing animation more smoothly and quickly; meanwhile, the lower-level fielders may stumble a bit as they pick up the ball, delaying their throw enough to allow the runner to reach base safely.
The developers’ goal is to make it “easier to see the difference between below-average, average, great, and amazing” infielders, according to Russell. “And hopefully you won’t get as mad when your shortstop misses this ball. You’re like,Why did he play that animation and miss that ball?It’s like,Oh, I see this yellow thing. That means he got a bad jump, and he got a bad jump because his fielding rating isn’t as good.”
As soon as Russell demonstrated how this system works inMLB The Show 25, I saw its potential to make my favorite mode, Road to the Show, more rewarding. I do get a lot of joy and fulfillment out of the career mode’s basic rhythm, which follows the languid pace of a baseball season. It’s the simple pleasure of jumping into another game and stepping up to the plate for another at-bat — a new opportunity to prove myself and raise my game — that keeps me going. But the grind can feel abstract at times, with such a gradual progression from promising prospect to big-league All-Star.
This year’s fielding feedback icons offer something concrete to work toward. The jump that an infielder gets is tied directly to their reaction attribute (REAC), which has tiers that correspond to probabilities on the field: If your player’s REAC rating is under 50, you’ll literally never see them get a great jump. But when you raise it to that threshold, it unlocks that possibility (albeit with a relatively low chance). Once you improve the attribute to 70, they’ll have, say, a 40% chance of getting a great jump. And an infielder with a 99 REAC will have the fastest possible reaction time on every ball hit in their direction.
I plan to spend hours upon hours inMLB The Show 25’s Road to the Show mode, as I do every year. But this time around, I’m particularly looking forward to raising my created player’s fielding abilities — something I’ve rarely thought about in the past — and anticipating the rush of satisfaction upon seeing that blue glow beneath his feet for the first time.
MLB The Show 25is scheduled to launch March 18 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X.

5 great games with dragons to play in 2025,2025-03-10T21:11:29Z,https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/536691/best-dragon-games-2025,"Looking for a dragon game? We’ve got you

What’s a dragon game? That’s any game that’s got dragons in it — typically, a game that prominently features dragons. While some dragons in dragon games are less prominent, they are no less important. Dragon games can be a part of any genre, be it the ever challengingElden Ringor the cozy life simulatorLittle Dragons Café. Whatever sort of game you’re looking to play, there’s probably a dragon game that fits within that genre.
And I’m an expert at this because, of course, I love dragons. A couple years ago, I read the nine books inNaomi Novik’s Temeraire series, and I was hooked.I’d never been a big fantasy reader— until then. I set off the following yearlargely reading only books that featured dragons. Eventually,the obsession seeped into the video games I played, too.
As for this list, there is one obvious choice of a dragon game, one that most people likely know:The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim, so I’m leaving it off. But do know, it’s an all-timer for dragons — and, if for some reason you haven’t played it yet, give it a try. But if you’re looking for something different, something that maybe you haven’t heard of or hadn’t realized was a dragon game, keep reading.
Where to play:Windows PCFields of Mistriaisn’t necessarilyaboutdragons, but its March 10 update made its dragon even more prominent. Caldarus, the town of Mistria’s dragon guardian, leads the player and imbues them with magic to assist in bringing the town back to life.Everyone’s wanted to date him, and, well, they might be able to now.
Where to play:PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XYes, you do often have to fight dragons inElden Ring, but the creatures aren’t just treated like pure beasts.Dragons inElden Ringare full, three-dimensional beingsthat have the same rich lore that the rest of the world benefits from. It’s one of the best dragon games for dragon lovers, if you go looking for its engaging, detailed lore.
Where to play:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PCLittle Dragons Caféis for the dragon warriors among us who are looking for a slower, cozier life than that ofElden Ring. A brother-and-sister duo running a small restaurant are given a dragon egg and tasked with running the business while raising the dragon. It’s a little rough around the edges, but if you’re looking for a slower pace and to raise a dragon, you’ll want to give it a go.
Where to play:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XIf you want to play as a dragon,Age of Wonders 4’sDragon DawnDLC is what you’re looking for.Age of Wonders 4is a 4X turn-based strategy game where you’re building a fantasy empire. TheDragon Dawnexpansion builds on that, except you play as the dragon ruler of a dragon empire, making both enemies and allies with the dragon elders that are at war.
Where to play:Nintendo SwitchYes,The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdomis a dragon game. It might not be known for its dragons, but dragons it has,and they’re actually super important to the game’s narrative. InTears of the Kingdom, you’ll see dragons floating above the clouds, and you find one of the dragons’ tears — imbued with memories — fallen around Hyrule. Plus, the designs are gorgeous; Nintendo’s created some of the best-looking dragons in games.

Hideo Kojima has a cameo in the surprise Control update that just dropped,2025-03-10T21:01:39Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/537294/hideo-kojima-control-surprise-update,"Hideo Kojima plays Dr. Yoshimi Tokui
byNicole Carpenter
Control’s Ultimate Edition got a new update on Monday, which adds new content to the game five years after its launch. That new (for many) content includes a cameo fromDeath StrandingdirectorHideo Kojima, who plays Dr. Yoshimi Tokui. “The mission is playable when you pick up the Dr Tokui Tapes collectible in the Extrasensory Lab of the Research Sector,” Remedy Entertainment community manager Vida Starcevicwrote in a post on theControlwebsite. This mission was previous only available to players on the PlayStation 4 Digital Deluxe edition.
Kojima seemingly recorded the lines for theControlmission in 2019,according to a post from his personal assistant. Kojima and Remedy Entertainment director Sam Lake swapped cameos;Lake made a cameo inDeath Strandingas Veteran Porter. Both games were released in 2019, and both topped plenty of game of the year lists,including Polygon’s.
As for the rest of the update,Controlplayers got three new outfits, which were previously preorder exclusive items. There were also some graphics and DLSS updates, as well as bug fixes. One of those general updates was to the audio on some cinematics and end credits, where there was apparently some mixing problems. “It wasn’t the Hiss, it was us,” Starcevic wrote. “Sorry.”
So far, the update is only for PC players. Remedy Entertainment expects to release the update on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X “in the near future.”
Both Lake and Kojima are working on follow-ups to their 2019 releases;Remedy Entertainment is working onControl 2, while Kojima’s Kojima Productionsis working onDeath Stranding 2: On the Beach.

This slimy Soulslike isn’t the cute Dark Souls alternative I hoped it would be,2025-03-10T20:01:38Z,https://www.polygon.com/impressions/536378/slime-heroes-impressions-xbox-pc,"Slime Heroes has good ideas but rough execution
byMichael McWhertor
Pitched as a cute, approachable “Souls-lite,”Slime Heroescombines two of my favorite things in video games: adorable slimes andDark Souls-style gameplay. Despite some good ideas,Slime Heroes’ recipe doesn’t quite work. Yes, it’s cute, but it also feels frustrating, clumsy, and unfinished.
Slime Heroescasts the player as a colorful, customizable blob who fights way above its weight class in an attempt to save a fantasy world from a spreading corruption. Played from a top-down isometric perspective, my slime has a variety of attacks at its disposal: a light attack, a heavy attack, and a jumping smash attack that adorably transforms my slime into a smashing fist or an anvil. I quickly earned spell-like skills that let me throw projectiles or summon a whirlwind that sucks in my enemies.
My slime can also find equippable weapons, like swords and spears, out in the world. (These weapons are also composed of slime.) And like any good video game protagonist, my slime can wear hats (and other accessories) that grant it super speed, health regeneration, or extra vitality.
Being a “Souls-lite,”Slime Heroesadopts various concepts from games likeDark Souls. In addition to light and heavy attacks for all weapons, my slime can dodge to avoid taking damage, a move that’s limited by a stamina meter of sorts. When my slime perishes — the remaining ooze spells out things like “ouch,” which is cute — it respawns at the last safe point I visited,Slime Heroes’ bonfire equivalent. And upon death, the shards I’ve collected from enemies I’ve defeated wait for me at the location of my defeat. These souls… er, shards can be spent on various slime upgrades.
Slime Heroesbuilds on solid concepts established by more than a decade of Souls games, but developer Pancake Games comes up short on adapting them in a cute, kid-friendly setting. Combat feels mushy and too simplistic to remain engaging. After battling a handful of the same dull enemy types again and again, I opted to simply scoot by many of them, bypassing combat when I could. Platforming has a similarly spongy feeling; it just doesn’t feel great to move through this world.
There is one very good idea at the heart ofSlime Heroes, though. As I progressed through its fantasy world, I unlocked skills that could be combined in clever ways. A skill like Whirlwind, which creates a vacuum-like tornado, can be combined with a skill like Projectile, so that my slime shoots a moving whirlwind. Or I can combine that Whirlwind with a Breath attack, causing the tornado that I summon to spit out columns of Breath attacks. What’s more, I can combine special effects with each skill, allowing me to add life-steal effects, fire, ice, and other modifiers for a massive number of unique combinations.
You can even summon familiars that fight on your behalf and modify them to fire meteors, resulting in screen-filling magical effects. Experimenting with these combinations can be fun, and I’d love to see other games built onSlime Heroes’ skill effects.
Unfortunately, the user interface forSlime Heroesmakes swapping skills, their primary and secondary effects, and their bonus special effects into something of a chore. Much of the UI is clunky, just part of an overall lack of polish on the game that’s incredibly disappointing.
It’s hard to recommendSlime Heroesto anyone looking for their next Soulslike fix. Kids might like it for its cute, well-animated characters, though I can see it being overly frustrating for an unskilled player;Slime Heroesdoesn’t do a good enough job with guiding players on what to do next or where to go. But it is kid- and new player-friendly in other ways, thanks to two-player couch and online co-op (a feature I didn’t get to test), and accessibility options that lower enemy damage and boost damage dealt by the heroic slime of its story.Slime Heroescan be really, really easy if you tune it right.
That’s not enough to makeSlime Heroesrise above its shortcomings. There’s good intention here, and some very cute visuals, but it’s missing what makes other Souls games great: finely tuned game mechanics.

Xbox handheld reportedly set for 2025 release,2025-03-10T18:01:20Z,https://www.polygon.com/xbox/537029/xbox-handheld-report-2025,"Codenamed ‘Keenan,’ per report
byNicole Carpenter
In 2024,Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer told Polygonhe couldn’t stop thinking about what an Xbox handheld could be. Months later, Spencer told Bloomberg Microsofthadindeed been thinking about it,but that it’s a piece of hardware that’s still years outfrom becoming a reality. That plan seems to have shifted:Windows Central reportedMonday that Microsoft will debut a handheld gaming device in 2025 “if plans are met,” with hardware that’s being developed by a partner — something akin to Valve’s partnership with Lenovoto bring the SteamOS to the Legion Go S.
Microsoft’s own proprietary handheld is still in the works, according to Windows Central, and is expected to be years away, reportedly part of the corporation’s next-generation plans for 2027 alongside the Xbox Series X successor. Polygon has not independently confirmed the launch of an Xbox handheld — either in 2025, or in 2027 with a next-generation console — but we’ve reached out to Microsoft for comment.
The reported 2025 “partner handheld” is codenamed Keenan, per Windows Central, and “will look unmistakably ‘Xbox’ […] complete with an official Xbox guide button, and Xbox design sensibilities.” Details, otherwise, are slim, leaving lots of questions on what exactly the handheld is or could be. Is this a reskinned iteration on theASUS ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, or another handheld? Something more unique to Xbox?
“I want my Lenovo Legion Go to feel like an Xbox,” Spencer told Polygon last year. “I brought [the Legion Go] with me to GDC. I’m on the airplane and I have this list of everything that makes it not feel like an Xbox. Forget about the brand. More like: Are all of my games there? Do all my games show up with the save that I want?”
If Spencer has any say, the upcoming Xbox handheld, regardless of who manufactures it, will certainly attempt to have that Xbox feel.

The new game releases this week are proof that cute animals make everything better. Shooters? Better if you’re an animal. Boba shop management sim? Great, now let me play as a penguin. Samurai game set in 19th-century Japan? Sounds like it needs a cat. There are games this week that don’t have animals, but we all know they’d be even better if they did.
Cheaters Cheetahis an FPS where you use cheats that people get banned for in other games, and you also play as bipedal cheetahs. It’s a ridiculous premise that I’m surprised I haven’t seen before. Following that,Rise of the Roninwill be released on PC. Everyone waiting forGhost of Yōteimight want to check it out for a little samurai action. And then there’sWanderstop, a cozy-ish game that’s also about burnout, dropping on the same day.
Here are our most anticipated game releases for the week of March 10.

It’s a mix ofSekiro-style combat with a unique “vendetta” mechanic based around defeating enemies who have previously bested you.
Release date:March 11Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis game is set up like a tea shop management sim, but it’s actually about burnout and not wanting to run a business at all. You’ll brew tea and decorate your shop while contemplating whether any of it is worth it as Alta, a championship fighter in limbo.
Release date:March 11Platforms:Windows PCWe’ve all dreamed of being a little penguin running a boba tea shop, and this game has made it a reality. You get to make drinks, meet friends, grow plants, and fight off your enemies with a boba cannon.

Release date:March 13Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PCNothing good can happen in a dark room where everyone has a flashlight and a gun. This multiplayer game is all about deceiving your opponents and sneaking through a mansion full of traps and other hazards while trying to be the last one standing.

"Sorry We’re Closed is a stylish, sexy survival horror surprise",2025-03-07T22:02:07Z,https://www.polygon.com/impressions/535708/sorry-were-closed-impressions-survival-horror,"This delightful fusion of Silent Hill, Persona, and light-gun shooters is now out on consoles
byMichael McWhertor
I had no idea what I was getting into when I jumped into the world ofSorry We’re Closed, a narrative-driven survival horror adventure that pairs the grime and decay of Silent Hill with the stylish, sexed-up demons of Persona games. But the artists behindSorry We’re Closedhave managed to remix some of my favorite gaming memories into something unique and surprising.
That even includes pairing Resident Evil-style tank controls and fixed camera angles with arcade light-gun shooters. Somehow all of these disparate gameplay influences come together in a nearly magical way.
Sorry We’re Closedfocuses on Michelle, a struggling, heartbroken Londoner who has an unlucky encounter with a sleep-paralysis archdemon known as the Duchess. This experience sends Michelle on a journey of discovery, during which she becomes immersed in a world of angels and demons in conflict; this experience ultimately unlocks magical powers within her. Cursed with mystical vision through a third eye, Michelle can see through the veil of the real world into the demon world and converse with its residents.
The Duchess has pursued Michelle as part of the archdemon’s mission to find love, and she’ll stop at nothing to convince her heartbroken prey to give in to these advances. Rebuffing her archdemon suitor, Michelle works with her friends (some of whom have secretly been demons this whole time) to break free of the Duchess’ curse and chase down the archdemon’s former flames/victims.
Michelle’s Evil Eye vision comes into play both narratively and in gameplay. With the press of a button and a snap of her fingers, Michelle can see other layers of her world, uncovering secret doors, hidden objects, and the corporeal forms of ethereal figures.Sorry We’re Closeduses this vision for environmental puzzles as well; a painting of eyes on a wall in the real world is revealed to be a smart-mouthed eye demon that blocks a pathway, and obstructions like an indestructible metal box can be revealed in the demon world as wooden boxes that can be smashed with an ax.
These Evil Eye powers also factor into combat. In the real world, you’ll face monsters that can be killed with multiple swings of an ax or riddled with bullets. But if Michelle flicks on her Evil Eye, she can see into the hearts of her enemies, attacking their weak point to slay them quickly. Michelle’s otherworldly vision only extends so far, though. There’s a trade-off between fighting enemies inefficiently in the real world at distance and allowing them to get closer so Michelle can kill them quickly but incur more risk in the process.
Combat and movement can be a bit clunky inSorry We’re Closed. While exploration is done in third-person view, combat switches to a sometimes disorienting first-person view. Here, the developers draw influence from light-gun games like Time Crisis or House of the Dead, pushing the player to attack rapidly and chain together combos. Pulling off a series of perfect attacks charges up a weapon called the Heartbreaker, a powerful rifle that deals massive damage to enemy demons.
Combat encounters inSorry We’re Closedclicked with me, but I can see them being a sticking point for some players. Fortunately, failure inSorry We’re Closedis rarely frustrating. The game has a manual save system with frequent save points and generous autosaving. While rationing bullets and health items — water bottles, because it’s important to stay hydrated — is a concern, the game is less punishing than many other survival horror games. (Accessibility options can also make the game much, much easier.)
Beyond combat and exploration of the game’s demonic worlds, Michelle spends a good deal of her time conversing with friends, frenemies, and the angels and demons she can see through her third eye. There’s a rich cast of characters, many of them relatably flawed people trying their best to find love or heal from trauma. These characters (and monsters) are all beautifully realized;Sorry We’re Closedoozes style with its mix of horny, elegant, and wonderfully weird misfits. It’s lovely to see a horror game with bright, flashy pops of color.
Sorry We’re Closedhas been out on PC platforms since November 2024. Developer à la mode games and publisher Akupara Games have since brought the game to consoles (Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X) and upgraded the original release with new features. For survival horror fans looking for a queer-romance-infused spin on retro Resident Evil-style gameplay,Sorry We’re Closedcomes highly recommended. You might just fall in love, which is exactly what the Duchess wants.

"Wanderstop is so much more than just brewing tea — but that part’s good, too",2025-03-07T22:01:23Z,https://www.polygon.com/review/536249/wanderstop-review-ivy-road-annapurna-tea-shop,"﻿Want some tea?
byNicole Carpenter
A few years ago, a sound bite went viral on TikTok: “Darling, I’ve told you several times before, I have no dream job. I do not dream of labor.”As writer Caitlyn Clark put it in Jacobin at the time, it’s no surprise that the statement resonated with people: a “tighter labor market,” Clark wrote, put increased pressure on workers over the past several years. It’s an increased strain that’s put more and more money in the pockets of the richest among us, yet it hasn’t created better workplaces or a better world for the rest of us. And I’ve been thinking about this phrase — “I do not dream of labor” — as I play developer Ivy Road’sWanderstop. Though the foot on protagonist Alta’s neck is not one of a corporation, but of an individual drive to succeed at all costs — certainly influenced by culture at large — she is ultimately worn down so severely that she can no longer continue. She’s forced to rest, to engage in a less laborious life. But her new life does, indeed, involve labor.
Wanderstopbegins with prolific and successful fighter Alta failing. It’s her first major failure — something she vowed would never happen to her. She had gone to a forest in search of a woman who can train her up, bring her back to her peak form, but the journey didn’t go as planned. Where she lands, instead, is a tea shop. The affable tea shop owner, Boro, plucked her from the forest after she collapsed, no longer able to wield her sword. She doesn’t want to stay, but she also can’t leave: Every time she tries, she collapses. She can’t hold her sword. And so, she does stay. People start to trickle into the tea shop and its surrounding clearing, so she makes them tea.
At this point, Alta probably does dream of labor — the labor of training and fighting for redemption. But over the course of roughly a dozen hours, she begins to let go of that compulsion. Alta trades one type of labor for another: one that’s more caring, slow, and, yes, healing.Wanderstop’s tea shop does not operate for profit. The land around the shop provides everything necessary to make a cup of tea, aside from the tea-making contraption itself. This is whereWanderstoppulls in its cozy gaming elements — the comforting repetition of a farming simulator, with a little twist, is the backbone of its gameplay. Working as Alta, I must plant seeds in specific formations to produce different sorts of plants to harvest both seeds and fruits; the seeds keep the farming running, and the fruits I use to brew tea. I explore the forest for tea leaves, sweep up piles of dead greenery, and snip invasive vines. The tea leaves get dried, and then I can make tea for the different people who pass by.
Each of these people stays briefly at the tea shop, their own stories playing out with every interaction. At first, Alta is desperate for labor — begging people to let her make them tea. But that attitude shifts with each cup of tea she makes as she grapples with her dark past, something she’s long blocked out. Her new form of labor, the act of foraging for ingredients, growing essential fruits, and brewing tea to serve to others, is what’s healing her; she’s engaging in her community in a useful, thoughtful way. Her labor makes a difference not only for herself, but for others, too. Separated from an exploitative system, her work means something more. Beyond the narrative,Wanderstoplargely succeeds at engaging with this ideology through its gameplay. I’m not necessarily rewarded in any way for brewing tea for people in the clearing, other than learning their own stories and preferences. This doesn’t unlock tools to do the job better or faster; I brew tea the same, complicated way each time, using a big ol’ contraption that requires several steps of manual labor.
There’s no real time limit on appeasing these customers; they’ll stay for as long as necessary to get their cup of tea. If you wanted, instead, to brew a dozen cups for yourself or Boro, that’s quite all right. Maybe you’d rather play around with decorations, or test out new combinations of patterns to grow other plants. That’s OK, too. ButWanderstopis a game, and there are still plenty of game-y elements that do detract from its themes. It’s pretty aggressive with its notification icons, for one, so it’s always immediately clear that there’s a new customer to serve or something another wants to tell you. For instance, there’s an early character who’s an eager knight placed under a curse. After one interaction, he sets back out into the forest to complete some task — but in my playthrough, he returned not even a minute later ready to push his own story further, a big yellow exclamation mark over his head as he rushed back toward me. The urgency of these sorts of interactions is entirely at odds with everything else in the game. There’s a meaningful friction in the narrative that makesWanderstopmemorable, but that friction isn’t replicated in the slightest with the gameplay. I can understand why, because adding that friction, be it simply through more time spent waiting or removing notification icons, risks players becoming frustrated and quitting. But it’s a friction that the game could have benefited from to better serveWanderstop’s unique framing.
This all comes back to the idea of dreaming about labor — or not. I don’t dream of labor within the system we live under now, but that doesn’t mean I don’t dream about labor at all. The future I dream of isn’t one without friction, but one that ensures a slower, happier life for my community, even if that means doing the work.Wanderstopfeels the most meaningful when it focuses on that.
Wanderstopwill be released March 11 on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. The game was reviewed on Steam Deck using a pre-release download code provided by Annapurna Interactive.

What’s the Switch 2 cross-gen plan? Nintendo’s history may tell us,2025-03-07T21:15:37Z,https://www.polygon.com/analysis/535677/nintendo-switch-2-cross-gen-plan-backward-compatibility,"Nintendo’s on the verge of a tricky console transition

Last week’sPokémon Presentswas more than a peek at what’s next for the Pokémon franchise. The showcase revealed new details on Switch gamesPokémon Legends: Z-AandPokémon Champions, but it also got to some of thebiggest questions about the future of the original Switch, including:
Nintendo has previously said that it’s working togive users a “smooth transition” from Switch to Switch 2, thanks to the widespread adoption of Nintendo Accounts. Depending on how smoothly that goes, the next-gen transition toSwitch 2should let Nintendo Account holders carry over their digital libraries, subscriptions, and personal information.
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has also said that the company is trying to produce as many Switch 2 units as possible for launch, both to meet consumer demand and deter resellers. The same is true on the software side; Nintendo is reportedly working to develop a robust launch lineup of exclusive games for Switch 2.
Nintendo has only a handful of first-party Switch games on its slate, includingMetroid Prime 4: BeyondandXenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, the latter of which drops this month. Whether the company has anything substantive in store for Switch 1 beyond those two titles is unclear; there have been persistent rumors that Nintendo’s sitting on various Legend of Zelda and Metroid Prime remasters for the original Switch, but Nintendo hasn’t confirmed any additional software for its current-gen console.
In February, Furukawa addressed the state of the Switch lineup going into 2025, but his response to questions about further games for the 8-year-old system was pretty open-ended.
“Since many people are playing Nintendo Switch, if we are able to develop appealing software, we would like to continue releasing new titles,” Furukawa said in translated remarks. “On the other hand, exclusive games are crucial when launching new hardware. With this in mind, we will consider various ways for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 to encourage as many consumers as possible to enjoy our games.”
For a look at what Nintendo might be planning in the future, we can look at its past.
When the original Switch was released in 2017, Nintendo was coming off the success of the 3DS and the failure of the Wii U. With more than 65 million 3DS systems in customers’ hands when the Switch launched, Nintendo wisely supported the 3D handheld for years into the Switch’s life with games likeMetroid: Samus ReturnsandWarioWare Gold.
It was a very different story for Wii U. With just 13 million of those consoles sold by 2017, Nintendo made a clean break; the final game it released for Wii U wasThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which launched concurrently with the Switch version.
The Switch being an instant hit (and Wii U practically dead) incentivized Nintendo to fully embrace the next generation back in 2017.
With more than 150 million Switch consoles sold to date, we can expect Nintendo to continue to cater to that platform’s existing audience, at least for a little while. There are still plenty of Wii U, 3DS, and GameCube-era games that could get upgraded Switch versions to keep the system humming along with “new” Nintendo games.
Nintendo has pledged backward compatibility for Switch games on Switch 2, so any future games released for the original Switch should be supported by its successor.
What’s less clear is Nintendo’s cross-generational strategybeyondbackward compatibility. Will the company release native Switch and Switch 2 versions of games likeMetroid Prime 4(à la previous cross-gen releasesTwilight PrincessandBreath of the Wild), or is the long-in-development Metroid game being built to play well on Switch and play better through backward compatibility on Switch 2? The latter seems more likely, or at least less complicated for Nintendo.
Nintendo certainly doesn’t want to fall into the trap that its console competitors have found themselves in this generation. Sony and Microsoft have supported the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One well into the life cycle of their successors, resulting in very few truly “next-gen” game experiences and a generation of consoles that never really felt like they had their moment.
So don’t expect Nintendo to support the original Switch for too long. Its focus seems clearly on Switch 2, and a clean break is likely coming soon. Maybe not in 2025, with a handful of Switch games still on the horizon — but soon enough to let Switch 2 stand on its own.
The best way to stay up to date on all things Nintendo Switch 2.
