"Fortnite OG Season 3 Launches Today Alongside The Walking Dead Assets Including Negan's Infamous Baseball Bat, Lucille",2025-03-25T13:52:18Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-og-season-3-launches-today-alongside-the-walking-dead-assets-including-negans-infamous-baseball-bat-lucille,"Fortnite OG Season 3 launches today alongside the arrival of assets from The Walking Dead, including Negan's infamous baseball bat.

Chapter 1 Season 3 sees the return of the Lucky Landing POI and a meteor that’s on a “seriously worrying collision course!” Epic Games said. Also from the OG days, the 50v50 LTM returns as OG 50v50.
OG 50v50 pits two 50-player teams against each other, and runs until 9am ET on April 14. Fortnite veterans will remember that 50v50 was the first-ever LTM to be added to Fortnite Battle Royale, all the way back in 2017.
The meteor will emerge in the sky later in OG Chapter 1 Season 3, and get closer and closer as the Season goes on. This, too, will be fondly remembered by Fortnite players who were there to see battle royale kick off back in the day.
Meanwhile, starting today, March 25, anyone can create their own The Walking Dead Universe islands for Fortnite using Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Fortnite Creative.
Creators can start a new project using one of the new The Walking Dead Universe templates to access unique Walking Dead-themed weapons, Prefabs, Galleries, and Walker NPCs. Then, on May 16, developers will be able to publish their The Walking Dead Universe islands via the Creator Portal and make them available for people to play.
Robert Kirkman, creator of The Walking Dead, said: “This collaboration with Fortnite is an incredible opportunity to expand The Walking Dead in ways we’ve never imagined. Whether it’s Lucille smashing through hordes or the eerie presence of Walkers, I can’t wait to see where the Fortnite community’s creativity takes us.”

Batman Is Getting a New Costume: These Are the Greatest Batsuits of All Time,2025-03-14T16:16:06Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-is-getting-a-new-costume-these-are-the-greatest-batsuits-of-all-time,"In case you missed the news, Bruce Wayne is getting a new look when DC Comicsrelaunches its flagship Batman series this September. Artist Jorge Jiménez has designed a new Batsuit that brings the classic blue cape and cowl back into the spotlight. After almost 90 years on the stands, DC is still tweaking the Dark Knight’s iconic costume.

But how does the new Batsuit measure up to the classics? What are the greatest Batman costumes of all time? We’ve handpicked our 10 favorite Batsuits from the comics, ranging from the original Golden Age costume to more modern reinterpretations like Batman Incorporated and Batman Rebirth. Scroll down to see them all.
And if Batman movies are more your speed, make sure you check outour ranked list of all the movie Batsuits.
1989’s Batman movie introduced a radically different, all-black Batsuit that remains one of the Dark Knight’s most iconic suits in any medium. DC never fully committed to porting that costume over to the comics (outside ofactual Burton-Verse tie-ins like Batman ‘89), but they did introduce a Batsuit inspired by the movies in the 1995 storyline “Troika.”
This new Batsuit adopted the all-black approach to Batman’s body but retained a more traditional blue cape and cowl. It even added more extreme elements like spikes on Batman’s boots, although those elements were toned down after the suit’s initial introduction. Regardless, the result was a more intimidating and stealthy Batsuit that became the default look for the Caped Crusader for the remainder of the ‘90s.
When Bruce Wayne returned following his apparent death in 2008’s Final Crisis, DC celebrated with the launch of a new series, Batman Incorporated, and a new costume designed by David Finch. That Batman Inc. suit is notable both for bringing back the classic yellow oval around the Bat emblem and for ditching the black trunks.
In many ways, the Batman Inc. suit feels like a more successful and visually cohesive version of what DC tried to accomplish with Batman’s New 52 suit a couple of years later. It introduced a more functional quality to Batman’s look, creating the impression that the Batsuit was less spandex than a true suit of armor, yet it avoided mucking up the design with too many stray lines. It also helped create some much-needed visual distinction between Bruce and Dick Grayson, who was also serving as Batman at the time.
The only element that slightly holds back the Batman Inc. look is the slightly goofy-looking armored codpiece. We’re not sure what the thinking was there.
The most recent creation on this list, there’s a reason the Absolute Batman Batsuit makes such a strong first impression. This is Batman at his most imposing.
Absolute Batman takes place in a rebooted DCU where Bruce Wayne lacks many of the advantages of his traditional counterpart, like a mansion and billions of dollars. Still, he manages to create quite an impressive crimefighting arsenal. Nearly every inch of this Batsuit is a weapon, from the razor-sharp ear daggers to the removable Bat emblem that doubles as a battle axe. Even the cape is completely redesigned, consisting of several flexible, arm-like tendrils.
Ultimately, though, it’s the sheer size of this Batman that makes the Absolute suit stand out. Writer Scott Snyder jokingly referred to Absolute Batman as “the Batman who lifts,” and you can see why.
In the alternate timeline of Flashpoint, Joe Chill killed a young Bruce Wayne, leading to a grieving Thomas Wayne becoming Batman instead. This darker, very different Batman needs a darker, very different Batsuit, and he got one in the form of a costume that drops the traditional yellow elements in favor of bold red accents. The Bat emblem, utility belt, and leg holsters are all a deep crimson, creating a unique and cool look. Couple that with the dramatic shoulder spikes on the cape and the fact that this Batman is known to wield guns and a sword, and you have one of the most visually arresting takes on an alternate universe Batman.
Artist Lee Bermejo has drawn and painted Batman a lot over the years, from the Batman/Deathblow crossover to the Joker graphic novel to theinfamous Batman: Damned. In that time, Bermejo has established a distinctive and very striking take on the iconic Batsuit, one unlike any other at DC Comics.
Bermejo’s Batsuit is about as far from the typical spandex look as you can get. This is armor, pure and simple,and the artist’s Batman is as much about function as he is form. But the goal isn’t necessarily realism here. Bermejo’s Batman is also a haunting figure, one mired in dirt and grime and a certain Gothic quality. This Batsuit, as much as any other, inspired the look of Robert Pattinson’s Dark Knight in 2022’s The Batman.
The DC multiverse is a vast place, and we’ve seen countless variations of the Batsuit appear on numerous worlds. That being said, none can truly measure up to Gotham by Gaslight’s Batman. It’s as if the character was made for this steampunk Victorian setting. The Batsuit perfectly translates into this bold revamp that trades skintight spandex for stitched leather and a billowing cloak.
Of course, it helps that the original Gotham by Gaslight series was illustrated by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. Mignola’s Batman is truly iconic, bathed in shadow and looking as if he were chiseled out of raw granite. And even though Mignola’s DC days are long behind him, this incarnation of the character lives on throughfollow-up stories like Gotham by Gaslight: The Kryptonian Age.
It says a lot about the original Bob Kane/Bill Finger-designed Batsuit that the design has survived with only modest changes for the better part of 90 years. All the right ingredients for a truly iconic superhero look were there from the start.
But in addition to serving as the basis for every Batsuit since, the Golden Age design is also notable for boasting some interesting features you don’t normally see elsewhere. The curved ears on Batman’s cowl give him an even more menacing vibe, while the purple gloves add a welcome pop of color. Even the cape is different in a fun way, being more akin to actual bat wings than a traditional superhero cape. It’s always exciting to see modern artists revisit this design.
For the majority of their hugely popular run on DC’s flagship Batman series, Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo focused on the New 52 costume. As we’ve already covered, that suit served as a notable attempt at updating the Caped Crusader’s look with a more modern, tactical bent, but that approach has been done better elsewhere. Case in point, Capullo’s own redesign that debuted just in time for the DC Rebirth relaunch.
Batman’s Rebirth costume is an upgrade on the New 52 suit in pretty much every way. It retains the tactical look while also downplaying some of the extraneous lines and details. It brings some much-needed color back into Batman’s look both with the yellow outline around the Bat emblem and the distinctive purple inner lining of the cape (a throwback to Batman’s Golden Age roots). It’s a bit of a shame that DC phased out this Batsuit after only a couple of years. As far as modern redesigns go, this is the one to beat.
The late ‘60s and ‘70s were a very transformational time for DC’s Batman comics. The books veered away from the camp that defined Batman’s Silver Age adventures and the live-action TV series toward more serious action/adventure and detective stories. Three artists really came to define Batman’s look in this period - Neal Adams, Jim Aparo, and José Luis García-López.
It’s not that these artists dramatically changed the makeup of Batman’s costume. This is the same blue cape and cowl and Bat emblem with yellow oval that was popularized by the TV series. But what unites Adams, Aparo, and Garcia-López’s work is the physicality they brought to the character. Gone was the burly brawler of the Silver Age, replaced by a leaner and more lithe Batman. Batman is basically a ninja superhero, so it makes sense that he be built more like a gymnast than a bodybuilder.
For many fans, this is still the standard by which all other Batman costumes are judged. That’s especially thanks to Garcia-López, whose art has adorned bedsheets, lunchboxes, T-shirts, and countless other Batman merch over the years.
Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee’s Hush storyline is often regarded as the start of the modern era of Batman comics. That’s thanks to Lee’s instantly iconic redesign of the Batsuit as much as anything else.
With the Hush costume, Lee brought a new level of elegant simplicity to the Batsuit. Gone is the yellow oval that persisted for decades, to be replaced by a sleek, black emblem. Lee’s knack for rendering dynamic, detailed, and very powerful superhero physiques is on full display in his Batman. Readers needed to believe that this Dark Knight could face down a gauntlet of his greatest foes – and Superman for good measure, and they certainly did.
The Hush redesign immediately became the default look for Batman going forward. Lee created a clear model that subsequent artists like Andy Kubert and Tony Daniel followed closely. While individual artists varied in whether they chose the blue or black cape and cowl, the rest of the details remained consistent. It’s telling that, after a period of focusing on more armored Batman costumes in the New 52 and DC Rebirth eras, DC eventually threw in the towel and went back to the Hush costume. It just plain works.
Artist Jorge Jiménez is no stranger to Batman at this point, but he’ll be debuting a new Batsuit when he and writer Matt Fractionkick off DC’s relaunched Batman series in September 2025.
The newest Batsuit isn’t a massive deviation from the now-standard Hush costume, though it does have a few interesting embellishments all its own. Where most artists in recent years have gravitated toward the black cape and cowl, Jiménez is bringing back the blue. Not only that, the cape is now heavily shaded, creating a stark contrast between the inner and older folds and bringing to mind Bruce Timm’s Batman: The Animated Series look. Even the Bat emblem is blue now, as well as sporting a bigger and more angular shape.
After all this time, it’s great to see Batman still trying out new looks. But will the latest redesign have the staying power of Batman’s most iconic suits? Only time will tell.

Here's Where You Can Read the Invincible Comics Online in 2025,2025-03-19T21:12:04Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-read-the-invincible-comics,"Robert Kirkman’s ultra-violent superhero comic book series published by Image Comics is as popular as ever. You have Amazon Prime’s adult animation adaptation of the series, which has justwrapped up its third season, with afourth on the way. Then there’s Mortal Kombat 1,where Omni-Man is playableand fits in perfectly with the violent and gruesome universe we’ve come to know and love.

But if you’re looking for the right place to immerse yourself in the source material, we've got you covered. Reading comics online has never been easier, and we’re here to show you the best ways to do so with Invincible.
If you’re on the fence on starting Invincible (why would you be? It’s amazing), then you can go directly to the Image Comics website to read the first issue absolutely free, no strings attached. This is a great way to see if the story is something that you may be interested in reading long term.
Once you’re ready to start reading the full series on the go, you can sign up for a handful of different digital comics services. You can read all of the Invincible compendiums (larger single-issue collections covering certain arcs) onHoopla. This is a greatfree service for borrowing digital comicsand books, just like the library. The catch - when you make your account, Hoopla looks for libraries in your area and, if that library doesn’t have Invincible available, you aren’t able to “check out” with it. Luckily, this is one of the most popular comic series around, so we’d be shocked if this happened. Link your library card and there you have it, the entirety of Invincible at the press of a button.
The upside to buying Invincible on the Kindle app versus checking it out of a virtual library is that you don’t have to worry about having limited time with it. The Invincible compendiums are hundreds of pages each, and while it’s inherently faster to read comics compared to a traditional book, that time really adds up. So purchasing is a better option for longevity’s sake. Additionally, the digital versions will typically save you a few bucks compared to physical.
If you’re like me and you prefer that tactile feel of flipping through the pages and displaying a nice shiny spine on your shelf, all three Invincible compendiums are also all available in trade paperback and hardcover versions. The trade paperbacks are each tend to go on sale off and on at Amazon right now, so now’s the perfect time to bolster your bookshelf collection. There are also the supplemental stories Invincible Universe you can expand to, which reveal the histories of many of Invincible’s most popular characters.

Lazarus: Fallen Brings a Landmark Image Comics Series to a Close,2025-03-20T16:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/lazarus-fallen-brings-a-landmark-image-comics-series-to-a-close,"Greg Rucka and Michael Lark's Lazarus (not to be confused withthe upcoming Shinichirō Watanabe anime Lazarus) has consistently been one of the best books being published by Image Comics in recent years. Now fans are in for some bittersweet news, as Image has announced the series will be reaching its conclusion with Lazarus: Fallen.

IGN can exclusively debut the first preview art for Lazarus: Fallen #1. Get a closer look in the slideshow gallery below:
Rucka, Lark, and Arcas are returning to the Lazarus series with this final volume, and are joined by letterer Ariana Maher, editor Alejandro Arbona, and graphic designers Eric Trautmann and Richard Howe.
For those not familiar with the series, Lazarus is set in a futuristic dystopia where the world has slid back into feudalism. The world is ruled by a handful of powerful Families, and the genetically engineered super-soldier Forever Carlyle is the top enforcer for the Carlyle Family. But now Forever has finally broken free of her father's control, and she means to bring the entire system crashing down.
“Michael and I started Lazarus back in 2013, and while we knew we were telling a story that was a distorted reflection of our world, I don’t think either of us imagined how less distorted that vision would become,” said Rucka in Image's press release. “But for all the talk about the world-building, about the vision of the future—or arguably, prescience of the present—Lazarus has remained, at its heart, about Forever’s journey. We’re finally getting to the resolution of it—the ending that we’ve been working on from the start. There’s so much I’m excited about sharing with this final run. There are things that I think will surprise some readers—some twists that they, perhaps, didn’t see coming. I know that it’s been a long wait for these final issues, and I’m grateful for the patience our audience has shown. We’ve got the most amazing fans, and that is both humbling and gratifying.”
""I'm very happy to get Lazarus back into readers' hands,"" said Lark. ""Greg has given me so much to explore with the characters and storytelling, and I'm really excited about the work I've been doing on the new issues. I think it is some of the best work I've ever done, and I hope readers feel the same.""
Rucka added, “I love working with Michael. He fits my sensibilities for storytelling so effortlessly, and his character work is never anything less than superb. He always delivers on the action, but it’s in the quiet scenes, in the emotional beats, that I think he shines brightest—and it’s in those moments that the series lives and breathes. This is unquestionably the best work of Michael’s career thus far, and that is genuinely saying something.”
Lazarus: Fallen #1 will be released on June 25, 2025.

Spider-Man: Brand New Day Explained and the Movie's Connection to One of the Most Notorious Marvel Comics,2025-04-01T16:55:28Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-brand-new-day-movie-2026-tom-holland,"As announced by Sony Pictures at CinemaCon 2025, the fourth MCU Spider-Man film will officially be titledSpider-Man: Brand New Day. The latest adventure for Tom Holland’s Peter Parker is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton of Shang-Chi fame, and swings into theaters on July 31, 2026. Anticipation for this new film is at a fever pitch, especially since Spider-Man: No Way Home was a smash hit withcriticsandaudiences. No new details were given about the film at Sony’s panel, but the title gives us plenty to chew on since, unlike the previous MCU Spider-Man film titles, this one is a direct reference to a story from the comics.

Brand New Day is one of the more famous Spider-Man stories because of its connection to the notorious One More Day storyline, and the use of this title may give big hints for Spider-Man’s future in the MCU. Let’s take a look at what Brand New Day may mean for Peter Parker’s upcoming film.
To properly explain Brand New Day, we first have to go over the events that led into it. During the Civil War crossover event, Peter Parker shocked everyone by revealing his secret identity to the world. He did this because he was part of Iron Man’s pro-registration side of the war, which required superheroes to register their identities with the government. However, the reveal of Peter’s identity led the Kingpin to order his assassination, only for the shooter to miss Peter and hit Aunt May instead. With May in the hospital, Peter looks for any help he can get to save her… which he receives in the form of Mephisto, who offers to save May’s life in exchange for undoing his marriage to Mary Jane.
To say that this story was controversial would be a severe understatement. Spider-Man making a deal with the Devil out of editorial mandate is well known as one of the most hated comic stories of all time. But what’s done is done, and that led to Brand New Day, starting with Amazing Spider-Man #546.
Brand New Day was a reset of Spidey’s status quo, and is less of an individual story in its own right than a branding exercise over a series of smaller arcs that ran all the way until Amazing #564. The overall story is about establishing what’s happened to the timeline after the Mephisto deal takes place, with the big ticket items including the world forgetting Spider-Man’s secret identity, Peter and Mary Jane having never been married, and the return of Harry Osborn. (He’d been dead for a while. Oh, and this one turned out to be a clone.)
Peter and MJ’s history was altered so they’d only been in a long-term relationship that was already over. New supporting cast and villains were introduced during this period, such as forensic scientist and future Spidey love interest Carlie Cooper, police officer Vincent Gonzalez, redheaded superhero Jackpot, Martin Li aka Mr. Negative, the Goblin-esque villain Menace (later revealed to be Harry Osborn love interest Lily Hollister), and the bane of every Insomniac Spider-Man player’s existence, Screwball. Brand New Day tried to rejuvenate the Spider-Man franchise by relaunching it, and although fan reception wasmixedto say the least, the era was a pivotal moment in the history of Spider-Man comics.
If you remember the plot of Spider-Man: No Way Home, you may recognize that some elements of that film already resemble aspects of One More Day and Brand New Day. Doctor Strange’s spell that Peter botches was supposed to erase the world’s knowledge of his secret identity, and in the end Strange needs to cast a new spell that results in everyone in the world forgetting who Peter is. This includes his love interest Michelle “MJ” Jones and best pal Ned Leeds, as well as all of Peter’s superhero friends. Peter receiving supernatural interference that results in the world forgetting that he’s Spider-Man and removing the Peter/MJ romance from the equation means that No Way Home is now effectively a loose adaptation of One More Day.
With Brand New Day starting a new era for Tom Holland’s Spidey franchise, we might now have some clues as to what characters will be included. Peter ran into Willem Dafoe’s Green Goblin in No Way Home via the power of the multiverse, but could the MCU’s take on the Osborns finally make their debut? Harry being Peter’s new bestie would make a lot of sense with Ned no longer knowing him. As well, Stranger Things alum Sadie Sink hasalready been cast, with the twobiggest theoriesas to her role being either an officially named Mary Jane Watson or longtime X-Men member Jean Grey. However, now that we know the title is Brand New Day, an outside the box choice could be her playing Carlie Cooper as a new love interest for Peter.
As for bad guys, could Mr. Negative be in the running for Spidey’s new nemesis? Fans of the comics and the Insomniac Spider-Man games know that Martin Li is associated with charity organization F.E.A.S.T. (Food, Emergency Aid, Shelter and Training), which actually made a blink and you’ll miss it cameo in No Way Home as the place where Aunt May works. The Darkforce wielding crime lord and his gang the Inner Demons are some of the most prominent Spider-Man foes to never appear in a live-action film. We doubt that Lily Hollister/Menace will be the new villain, but she could still appear in some capacity if the film decides to lay groundwork for the MCU’s Osborns.
Of course, we can’t discount the possibility that the movie is only using the title Brand New Day and will chart its own course. The MCU has a history of doing that, with films like Age of Ultron and Infinity War not having much at all to do with their comic counterparts. Perhaps Brand New Day is merely a signifier that this is a new direction for the Spider-Man franchise after the Home trilogy.
It is also entirely possible that Brand New Day will avoid these newer characters and undo the spell cast at the end of No Way Home, allowing Peter’s old friends to return to the series. However, that would be a missed opportunity to not use No Way Home’s ending to tell a more grounded, street level Spider-Man story. Although with Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars on the way, we’d be surprised if Peter doesn’t wind up in some more multiversal mischief sooner or later. We’ll all find out when the film arrives next July.

Invincible Season 3 Ending Explained: How Does It Set Up Season 4?,2025-03-13T17:23:30Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-season-3-ending-explained-how-does-it-set-up-season-4,"This article contains spoilers for theInvincibleSeason 3 finale.

After eight episodes featuringhugecharacter deaths, multiple Invincibles (Steven Yeun), and so, so much blood and guts, Invincible Season 3 is in the books. Unlike Season 2, which ended with a relatively quieter tag for the finale, Season 3 not only teed up atonof storylines for the already-in-production Season 4… It also included a mid-credits scene that sets up a storyline Invincible co-creator Robert Kirkman never got to do in the comic books.
Before we get to that closing montage – and mid-credits scene – a bit of explanation about the finale itself. It’s for the most part one, long fight scene as Invincible, Oliver (Christian Convery) and Atom Eve (Gillian Jacobs) take on the vicious Viltrumite warrior Conquest (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Conquest is ostensibly on Earth to prepare the world for Viltrumite, er, conquest, but as he explains repeatedly to Invincible, he really loves destroying and torturing things.
After Conquest seemingly kills Eve, Invincible, who has had both hands broken, absolutely loses it and bashes Conquest to “death” with his own head. Some might say this is sweet, sweet vengeance for Negan (also Morgan) famously bashing Glenn Rhee’s (also Yeun) head in on The Walking Dead, but it comes straight from the Invincible comics, which came out in 2009. So incredibly satisfying to watch if you want #Justice4Glenn, but also mostly just a nice coincidence.
In any case, Eve isnotdead and reveals – as fans who watched the Atom Eve Special learned – that when she’s put in moments of extreme stress, she’s able to get past the mental blocks that otherwise stop her from transmuting living matter, instead of just inert materials. However, eagle-eyed fans will also note that when she transmutes Invincible’s costume later in the scene when they’re about to have sex, it’s made of plants… So she may have broken through these blocks in a bigger way than she realizes.
The final conclusion of the episode, and the arc of the season, is that Invincible visits his half-brother Oliver in a hospital bed. And while Oliver thinks Invincible is going to tell him that killing is wrong… Invincible has decided that if anyone threatens his family again, just as Angstrom Levy (Sterling K. Brown) did in the previous episode, and Conquest this week, he won’t hesitate to kill them.
It’s a surprising move from the show, though again one pulled directly from the comic books, almost word for word. While the large majority of superhero media, from TV shows to movies, to the original comics wrestle with the “should heroes kill?” debate, Invincible has firmly fallen on the side of “yeah, when necessary.” Still, an ominous musical sting played under Invincible’s pro-death penalty statement points to more challenges coming the way of his realigned moral compass. So expect that this debate might not be as open and shut as the finale indicates.
Beyond that, the real eyebrow-raising moments are saved for that montage. So let’s break those Season 4 teases down, one by one.
Last seen in Season 2, Episode 6 “It’s Not That Simple,” the Sequids are incredibly dangerous Martian brain slugs who almost beat the Guardians of the Globe in their last encounter, including Invincible and Atom Eve. They had taken over the brain of an astronaut named Rus Livingston (Ben Schwartz), who was finally freed and brought back to Earth after a horrifying, harrowing ordeal. Unfortunately for Rus, after he returned to his apartment, which had been trashed by Shapesmith (also Schwartz), he threw up a Sequid in the sink – which immediately took over his body, again.
That plotline has been on hold since the aforementioned episode, but looks like it’s coming back in a big way in Season 4. While everything else has been going on this season, the Sequids have been steadily building an army in the sewers, including what looks like hundreds of human workers and others. Given we were told that if the Sequids ever made it to Earth it was game over for humanity… Yeah, that’s bad! “Not long now,” says Russequid. Uh-oh!
At the end of Season 3, Episode 4, “You Were My Hero,” the unstoppable Battle Beast was fighting a Viltrumite in the cold, dark reaches of space. We catch up to him here, as well as the scattered remains of the Viltrumite… BB is in suspended animation but is quickly picked up by an alien ship. And a few seconds after that, he wakes up, ready for battle. He wants “more!”
If things pan out on the TV show the same way they do in the comic, the ship was part of the Coalition of Planets, the group fighting back against the Viltrumites. Alongside Allen the Alien (Seth Rogen) and Nolan Grayson (J.K. Simmons), it looks like the Coalition finally has a fighting chance against the unstoppable aliens.
In one of the best casting coups on the show, the creepy, Cenobite-esque Technicians who fixed up Angstrom Levy, as first seen in Season 3, Episode 7, are voiced by Doug Bradley. You might know him better as Pinhead from the Hellraiser series. And in this teaser of coming attractions, we get to hear Bradley say somethingextremelyPinhead.
After revealing that Angstrom has a new arm thanks to them (Invincible accidentally amputated it last episode), Angstrom asks what they want in return. “Angstrom Levy, you have witnessed what our ambitions have done to our world, and what we have had to do to ourselves to survive here,” a Technician explains.
Angstrom thinks they want a new home, but the Technicians have other ideas. “That is only the beginning of the delights we will achieve together,” the Technician says. Now, the classic Hellraiser line is “We have such sights to show you” while the 2022 remake employed “greater delights await.” But come on, if you weren’t Leo Dicaprio pointing at the screen meme at that line, what are we even doing here?
In any case, to explain what the Technicians are up to is to spoil one of the great plot twists of the Invincible comics. Suffice it to say that they will tie into the action, and we have not seen the last of either Angstrom or the not-Cenobites.
Despite Invincible demanding Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins) show him Conquest’s dead body, it turns out that the dead body was a fake. In fact, Cecil has Conquest locked in a massive, underground chamber as the Viltrumite’s body reconstitutes itself.
Donald (Chris Diamantopoulos), Cecil’s right-hand man, protests that this is a mistake. And if you’ve read the comics, you know that Donald is correct: you cannot hold a massively powered Viltrumite like Conquest with mere Earth materials, no matter how secure Cecil makes the facility. Unfortunately for Cecil, as well as the world, in this case, Invincible was correct: Conquest should have been killed.
That brings us to the mid-credits scene. While everything else we’ve explained above happens in the comic books by Kirkman, Ryan Ottley, and Cory Walker, this scene is completely new. And in fact, it’s something Kirkman always wanted to do in the comics, but never found room for. Oh, and there’s a fantastic, surprise voice actor involved.
Right after the end credits begin, we cut to Damien Darkblood (Clancy Brown), the demon detective we haven’t seen since Season 1, Episode 4, “Neil Armstrong, Eat Your Heart Out.” In case you forgot – it aired back in 2021, after all – Damien was investigating Omni-Man, then set up by Cecil and sent back to Hell. As he was sucked down to the inferno, he threatened vengeance on Cecil… And that’s (potentially) what we’re seeing here.
Now missing his trenchcoat, Damien creates a summoning circle, which calls a demon lord voiced by none other than Bruce Campbell. And Damien hails to the king, baby, by bringing “the great beast… welcome news.” Damien explains that he has the means to restore the demon to his former glory, and the “infernal throne.” The key? A “surface dweller of great power, likes of which this planet has not seen for eons.” And furthermore, Damien explains that “his blackened heart will be bound to your service.” And how will they do that? By conjuring “him” to Hell.
In the comics, Damien Darkblood was even more of a blink-and-you-miss-him character than he was on the TV show. But as Kirkman explained to theCartoonist Kayfabe podcastin 2020, there was originally more planned.
“The thing that I really regret is I never had an adventure where the superheroes went into Hell,” Kirkman explained. “There’s been so many superhero comics where it’s like, they got to go fight Mephisto or something, and I was like, ah jeez, I never got around to that. And the Damien Darkblood character was there so I could eventually do a story like that, and I never got around to it.”
Part of the reason for this may be that the initial storyline and reveal of Omni-Man as a bad guy was supposed to go nearly double the length that it did in the comic. It ultimately came to a head in issues 12 and 13, versus the planned 25. That meant there just wasn’t as much room for Darkblood to be investigating Omni-Man, because… Well, there was nothing left to investigate. So credit to Kirkman and company for letting that planned story play out on the TV show in a way we never saw in the books.
The big question here is: who is Damien Darkblood referring to? Is it Invincible? Omni-Man? Cecil? We’ll know more when Season 4 of Invincible premieres on Prime Video."
Imperial: House of X's Jonathan Hickman Reveals His Next Great Marvel Epic,2025-03-14T16:58:35Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/imperial-house-of-xs-jonathan-hickman-reveals-his-next-great-marvel-epic,"Havingfundamentally transformed the X-Men franchiseand debuteda brand new incarnation of the Ultimate Universe, writer Jonathan Hickman is gearing up for his next great Marvel epic. Today Marvel Comics revealed new details about Imperial, a four-issue event series that promises to reshape the fabric of the wider Marvel Universe.

Similar to how 2023's Ultimate Invasion paved the way for the ongoing Ultimate Universe line, Imperial is designed to shake up the status quo for Marvel's cosmic characters and lay the foundation for a new line of comics. In this series, many of the traditional power players in the Marvel Universe will be destroyed or overthrown, leaving room for new empires to rise in their place. The series will specifically center around the Hulk family, Black Panther, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Nova Corps, and other cosmic kings and queens.
Imperial will be written by Hickman and drawn by Federico Vicentini (Miles Morales: Spider-Man) and Iban Coello (Venom). Hickman's Ultimate Spider-Man collaborator Marco Checchetto is drawing the covers for the series.
""I'm very excited about this project as I’m obviously a huge fan of all things Marvel Cosmic,"" Hickman said in a statement. ""The goal here is to kind of do what we did with the recent Ultimate line for all of our space titles, except having the setup book (Imperial) be more of an event than a world-building exercise (like Ultimate Invasion). The art team is killing it, and we’re all just very excited for what’s happening in this special corner of the Marvel Universe.""
Based on the cover and concept art revealed so far, we can infer certain things about the big changes coming in Imperial. It seems the Nova Corps will be decimated (again), while Star-Lord looks to play a central role in the conflict. It also appears that an entire family of Hulks will take control of the bloody world of Sakaar. And given Black Panther's presence in the story, it's a safe bet that the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda has a part to play in this conflict.
Imperial #1 will be released on June 4, 2025. Let us know your theories about the book in the comments below.
In other upcoming Marvel news, we're gettinga new Thunderbolts team that includes Wolverine, Hulk, and Carnage, and we gotan exclusive look at Daredevil: Cold Day in Hell.

Daredevil: Born Again Proves That Less Is More With Its Villain Muse,2025-03-26T03:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/daredevil-born-again-proves-that-less-is-more-with-its-villain-muse,"Warning:this article contains spoilers for Daredevil: Born Again Episode 6.

Daredevil: Born Again Season 1 may feature some familiar MCU villains in Vincent D’Onofrio’s Wilson Fisk and Wilson Bethel’s Bullseye, but it also introduces a brand new threat in the form ofthe artistically inclined serial killer Muse. Muse’s murals have been appearing all over the city, and now we know the full, gruesome story behind their creation.
Visually and in terms of his modus operandi, Muse is pulled directly from the pages of Marvel’s Daredevil comics. But in other ways, the character has been streamlined and altered for his live-action debut. Frankly, we think he’s all the better for it. Here’s why Born Again has been smart in its adaptation of this more recent addition to Daredevil’s rogues gallery.
Again, the new series sticks pretty close to the source material where Muse’s artistic sensibilities lie. He’s a street artist with a particular fascination with New York’s vigilantes. He paints tributes to these figures using human blood as a key ingredient. Though the comic book version of Muse goes a step further with his grisly brand of artistic expression, eventually arranging dead bodies to form sculptures. He’s a villain who wouldn’t be out of place in the Hannibal TV series.
In other ways, however, The MCU’s Muse is quite a bit different from the comic. There’s his apparent lack of powers, for one thing. In the comics, Muse is more than a match for Daredevil and his heightened senses. His body acts as a sort of sensory void that confounds Matt’s senses. He also has superhuman strength and agility for good measure.
In the show, it doesn’t appear that Muse has any powers to speak of. He’s just a guy who really enjoys treating innocent passersby as blood bags and has some passable martial arts skills. But that’s a good thing. Muse really doesn’t need powers to serve as a proper foil to Matt Murdock. Like its predecessor, Born Again exists in a more grounded corner of the MCU. Daredevil, for all his enhanced senses and ninja training, is a guy who emerges from many battles bruised, battered, and thoroughly winded. As long as Muse is presented as a guy who can put up a decent fight, he really doesn’t need superhuman strength to make the stakes feel clear and real.
Plus, the idea that Muse’s body is a sensory vortex was always a bit silly. It’s too on the nose, even for the Marvel Universe. He becomes a character who exists solely to vex Daredevil rather than on his own terms.
The other big difference with Born Again’s Muse is that there’s no sidekick stuck in the middle of the Daredevil/Muse rivalry. At the time Muse was introduced in 2016, Matt was mentoring a hero named Blindspot. It’s Blindspot who wound up suffering the most at Muse’s hands, losing his eyes to the sadistic villain and having to learn how to operate without the benefit of sight.
Here again, the show succeeds in streamlining and simplifying that dynamic so that the focus remains squarely on Daredevil, Fisk, and Muse. By now it’s become apparent that Muse isn’t really the endgame villain of the series, but rather a secondary antagonist meant to test the former two characters. Muse’s blood-soaked artistic campaign puts Fisk’s newfound political career at risk, pushing him closer to outright authoritarianism. In Episode 6, Muse becomes the catalyst that finally compels Matt to throw caution to the wind and become Daredevil again. Having a character like Blindspot in this mix would only serve to needlessly complicate matters.
Muse may not be the central villain of Born Again, but he is an important player who further illustrates the struggle Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk both face in trying to reinvent themselves. The series wisely ignores the comic book elements that don’t really matter to the story being told. But there is one more potential change to Muse that Born Again looks poised to explore in the episodes to come. Who exactly is under that mask?
The Daredevil comics never really get into the question of who Muse is when he’s not dressed in costume and draining human blood to make art. He’s depicted as an Inhuman (the same species as Anson Mount’s Black Bolt and the other characters fromthe much-reviled Marvel’s Inhumans series). That eliminates the need for the character to have any sort of civilian identity or private life. But in the show, there’s no reason to assume Muse is an Inhuman or anything other than a truly messed-up artistic savant.
But that does raise an interesting question. If Muse is an ordinary man, who is he? Making matters more interesting is the fact that we still don’t know which actor is playing Muse. Marvel has kept mum on that detail, which all but confirms that Muse is secretly someone else we’ve already met in the show.
Who could it be under that mask? There are all sorts of intriguing theories. Maybe Bethel’s Bullseye has somehow escaped from prison and taken on a new costumed identity. Maybe Arty Froushan’s Buck Cashman is up to some unsavory business when not serving as Fisk’s right hand. Maybe Michael Gandolfini’s Daniel Blake is more demented than we gave him credit for (though Blake doesn’t seem to have the right build).
There are even more outlandish possibilities. With allthe rampant speculation that Elden Henson’s Foggy Nelson faked his death, maybe we’ll find out it’s Foggy under the mask. Hey, there has to be some reason thatHenson is coming back for Season 2.
Whatever the truth here, it seems safe to assume that there’s a big reveal coming as far as Muse’s true identity. And whomever ultimately emerges as the culprit behind Muse’s horrific work, that reveal may serve as the biggest deviation from the comics. As much as the series has succeeded in simplifying and streamlining Muse, it’s also managing to add something new and exciting to the character.

Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito Was Originally Asked to Play King Cobra In Captain America: Brave New World,2025-03-18T15:28:11Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/breaking-bads-giancarlo-esposito-originally-asked-to-play-king-cobra-captain-america-brave-new-world,"One of the most fun things about movie-making is remembering all of those little things that almost were and could have been. So many things change in pre-production, post-production, and even the actual production itself — and forCaptain America: Brave New World, one of those things was the role Giancarlo Esposito was going to play.

Esposito ultimately played Sidewinder in the film, but was originally approached to play King Cobra. The Breaking Bad legend revealed toEmpirein a recent interview (via Collider) that producer Nate Moore hadoriginally asked him to portray Klaus Voorhees’ alter ego.
""If I'm walking around the neighborhood, African-Americans go, 'What's up, King?' I love it. They call me King, baby! I mean, that's the highest honor,"" Esposito recalled thinking in those early days. ""But as it turned out, there [are other Kings] in the Marvel world, and this was connected to the Serpent Society — they were going back to the comics and trying to figure it out, and Nate said, 'We can give you all the characteristics of King, but we think he should be Sidewinder.' ""
Voorhees appears in the Captain America comics as a former convict who has to contend with a radioactive snake bite after his murder plot to axe colleague Professor Ezekiel Schektor doesn’t quite go as planned, hence the name King Cobra. In his time on the page, he has battled the likes of Mr. Fantastic, Thor, and Daredevil, as well as Cap and Falcon.
That said,the creatives behind Brave New Worldultimately had Esposito play Sidewinder, aka Seth Voelker, an economics professor who gets chemically mutated by the Roxxon Oil Company and becomes a crime boss and the leader of Serpent. Over the years, he’s had major face-offs with Scarlet Witch, The Thing, Triton, and Stingray — but now he’s having one with Cap himself.
""They spoke about creating a character that was really grounded, in a mercenary fashion,” Esposito added, noting that the character was shaped inthe film's robust reshoots. “They wanted to ground the movie when they went back in to do some additional shooting, and their focus now was on this additional character. So it was a bit of a whirlwind for me. I focused myself and I went in there and knocked it out.""
As for the character’s future in the MCU, it seems at least Esposito wants him to stick around. ""I'm hoping to be in this universe a little longer,"" he said.
It’s no secret thatCaptain America: Brave New Worlddidn’t exactly light the world on fire in terms ofcritical response, fan response, or box office. Check out IGN's feature,Captain America: Brave New World’s Real Budget? You’ll Never Know… and This Is Why, to find out more.

How to Watch (and Read) Tim Burton's Batman Universe In Chronological Order,2025-03-10T19:47:28Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-1989-tim-burton-michael-keaton-chronological-order,"Tim Burton may not have directed a Batman movie in over 30 years, but his DC Universe is still going strong. Michael Keaton got the chance to reprise the Bruce Wayne role in 2023’s The Flash, a movie that (briefly) ported his Batman over to the DCEU. But even now, the Burton-Verse continues to expand through new comic book and novel spinoffs likethe recently announced Batman: Revolution.

It’s gotten to the point where the question of how to watch and read the entire Burton-Verse is a surprisingly complicated one. But don’t worry, we’re here to help. Read on for a full breakdown of how the various Tim Burton Batman movies, novels, and comics fit together.
You can also check out our full guide towatching all the Batman movies in order.
Counting the yet-to-be-released Batman: Revolution, there are currently seven projects set in Burton’s Batman universe - three films, two novels, and two comics. That lineup includes 1989’s Batman, 1992’s Batman Returns, and 2023’s The Flash, as well as the books Batman: Resurrection and Batman: Revolution and the comics Batman ‘89 and Batman ‘89: Echoes.
This lineup also excludes 1995’s Batman Forever and 1997’s Batman & Robin, which are no longer considered to be part of Burton’s Batman universe. We’ll get into the reasons why a bit later.
Although you can stream Burton’s Batman movies on Max and read the Batman ‘89 comics on DC Universe Infinite, it never hurts to go the physical media route these days. If you’re looking to buy the Burton-Verse movies and books, here are some good options:
*Each blurb contains a broad overview of the plot and mentions the heroes/villains who appear in that film or book.
This is the original movie that started it all. Burton’s first Batman movie pits Michael Keaton’s Dark Knight (still early in his superhero career) against Jack Nicholson’s Joker. The movie inspired a summer of “Bat-Mania” and proved there was a healthy appetite for darker, more mature superhero movies in Hollywood.
This novel by John Jackson Miller is set in the aftermath of the first movie, as Batman deals with the remnants of the Joker Gang and confronts the rise of the shape-shifting villain known as Clayface. The book is designed to bridge the gap between Batman and Batman Returns, including introducing Christopher Walken’s character Max Shreck and giving readers more insight into the collapse of Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale’s (Kim Basinger) romance.
Miller is returning for a second novel set between the events of Batman and Batman Returns. This time, Revolution will introduce the Burton-Verse’s version of Riddler, a lowly newspaper copy editor named Norman Pinkus who laments the fact that no one appreciates his aptitude for solving crimes. Pinkus will turn to a life of crime and capitalize on the city’s growing resentment toward the wealthy elite of Gotham.
Burton and Keaton both returned for this film sequel, which is set a few years after the events of the first movie. This time, Batman goes up against Michelle Pfeiffer’s Catwoman and Danny DeVito’s Penguin as Gotham City endures a hellish holiday season. Despite initial plans for a third Batman movie, both Burton and Keaton ultimately dropped out of what became 1995’s Batman Forever.
DC’s Batman ‘89 comic serves as a direct sequel to Batman Returns and is set three years later. The six-issue comic, written by Batman screenwriter Sam Hamm and illustrated by Joe Quinones, draws inspiration from Burton’s abandoned plans for a third Batman movie. The book sees Billy Dee Williams’ Harvey Dent become Two-Face, while also introducing a version of Robin modeled after Marlon Wayans (who at one point was attached to play the role in Batman Returns). Michelle Pfeiffer’s Catwoman also makes a return appearance, paying off on the tease from the end of Batman Returns.
Click here to learn more about how Batman ‘89 adds to the Burton-Verse.
Just as Batman ‘89 is essentially Burton’s Batman 3 in comic form, Hamm and Quinones reunited for a follow-up that acts as a hypothetical fourth Burton movie. Three years after the events of Batman ‘89, Keaton’s Bruce Wayne has gone missing, leaving Robin and the new Batgirl to deal with the threat posed by Scarecrow (modeled after Jeff Goldblum) and Harley Quinn (modeled after Madonna).
While only hardcore Burton-Verse completionists need to worry about this one, it's worth mentioning that Robert Wuhl briefly reprises the role of intrepid reporter Alexander Knox in the first chapter of The CW's Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover. That episode briefly shifts focus to Earth-89, where Knox is seen reading a newspaper in a park as red skies form over Gotham. It's one ofnumerous live-action DC cameos in the crossover.
While it didn’t fare well critically or commercially, The Flash at least has the distinction of giving Bat-fans some closure on the saga of Keaton’s Batman. Keaton himself returns to play a much older Bruce Wayne, after Ezra Miller’s Barry Allen mucks about with the DCEU timeline and inadvertently trades one Batman for another. Meeting The Flash and learning about the threat of Michael Shannon’s General Zod is enough to coax Batman out of retirement for one last, high-stakes mission.
1995’s Batman Forever and 1997’s Batman & Robin were once considered sequels to Batman and Batman Returns, despite the fact that neither Burton nor Keaton returned for these projects. The presence of supporting characters like Pat Hingle’s Commissioner Gordon and Michael Gough’s Alfred maintained some degree of continuity with the previous films. However, these two sequels are generally regarded as being inferior to their predecessors, as well as being far different tonally.
With the release of The Flash, DC now officially treats Batman Forever and Batman & Robin as being set in a separate version of the DC Universe. The Batman ‘89 comics now act as the definitive, canon sequels to Batman Returns, revealing what happened to Keaton’s Bruce Wayne between the events of Returns and The Flash.
Warning:this section contains spoilers for The Flash!
The Flash wasn’t always intended to be the end of the road for Keaton’s Batman. At one point, the character was being positioned for an ongoing role in the DCEU (before WB cut that cinematic universe’s future short). Reportedly,a previous version of the movieended not with Batman dying in battle against Zod in the Flashpoint timeline, but with both Keaton’s Bruce and Sasha Calle’s Supergirl crossing over into the restored DCEU. That’s where WB’s canceled Batgirl movie comes in.
Keaton wound up reprising the role again in Batgirl, which reportedly cast him as an aged, Batman Beyond-esque mentor to Leslie Grace’s rookie Barbara Gordon. J.K. Simmons also returned as the DCEU Commissioner Gordon, while Brendan Fraser played the villain Firefly.
The Batgirl movie made it well into post-production beforeWB infamously pulled the plug and canceled it as a tax writeoff. It became a major casualty in the studio’s evolving plans for the DC line and the pivot toJames Gunn and Peter Safran’s DCU. Barring any major leaks, Keaton fans will never have an opportunity to see what will likely be his final Batman performance.

The Top 10 Greatest Batman Crossovers of All Time,2025-03-24T20:35:30Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-10-greatest-batman-crossovers-of-all-time,"Batman can only team up with fellow DC heroes like Superman, Wonder Woman, and The Flash so many times before it starts to get a little old. Sometimes, we need a story that shakes things up and removes the barriers between pop culture universes. That’s how we’ve gotten some truly classic and downright weird comic book crossovers over the decades.

From obvious team-ups like Batman/Spider-Man and Batman/The Shadow to more unusual fare like Batman/Elmer Fudd, these are the best (as well as some of the weirdest) Batman crossovers of all time. Note that we’re focused only on the stories where Batman himself is the main player, not Justice League-centric crossovers likeJustice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong.
As arguably the two biggest superheroes in the world, it’s inevitable that Batman and Spider-Man would cross paths at some point. If anything, it’s surprising that Marvel and DC waited until 1995 to make that pairing happen. But Spider-Man and Batman was certainly worth the wait. This crossover zeroes in on the similarities between the two heroes and their respective tragic pasts, while also making the sensible choice to pit them against the tag team psychopathic duo of Joker and Carnage.
Spider-Man and Batman’s greatest strength is that it’s built by two decorated Spider-Man veterans - Kraven’s Last Hunt writer J./M. DeMatteis and prolific Amazing Spider-Man artist Mark Bagley. The result is a book that feels like a natural extension of the ‘90s Spider-Man comics (minus all the Clone Saga nonsense).
Buy DC vs. Marvel Omnibus on Amazon.
As two dark vigilantes with billowing capes and huge fanbases, Spawn and Batman are another natural choice to pair together. To date, there have been three crossovers between the two franchises (including the very recent Batman/Spawn), but we’re giving the nod to the original. That’s because the first crossover boasts the most impressive creative team, joining The Dark Knight Returns writer Frank Miller with Spawn creator Todd McFarlane. That creative pedigree makes for a fun and suitably dark team-up adventure.
Buy Batman/Spawn: The Classic Collection on Amazon.
Since their 2011 reboot at IDW, the Ninja Turtles have gone on to star in a great many crossovers. Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles remains one of the best, thanks to the strong pairing of Batman veteran James Tynion IV and artist Freddie E. Williams II.
This crossover makes for a very entertaining meeting between two worlds, making the most of the clash of personalities between the Batman family and the Turtles. Plus, who among us hasn’t wondered if Batman could take Shredder in a one-on-one duel? Tynion and Williams also find real emotional weight in forging a bond between the Dark Knight and the Heroes in a Half Shell.
The original crossover proved successful enough for DC and IDW to reteam on two direct sequels (plus a separate crossover based on the animated versions of the characters). This crossover evenspawned a 2019 animated movie, which is also well worth watching.
Buy Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Vol. 1 (2025 Edition) on Amazon.
In many ways, the original Golden Age incarnation of Batman is a very different character from what would follow. It’s that version of Batman that shines in this unique and entertaining crossover series. Written by 100 Bullets’ Brian Azzarello and drawn by Identity Crisis’ Rags Morales, First Wave combines a number of iconic pulp heroes into one universe. Here, the Caped Crusader (uncharacteristically toting a pair of guns) rubs elbows with everyone from Doc Savage to The Spirit to Rima the Jungle Girl. The series is a lot of fun, and we only wish the so-called Pulpverse had become a permanent part of DC’s multiversal lineup.

It’s safe to say that without The Shadow there would be no Batman. Pairing the two dark avengers of the night is only logical, and we’re glad this series does such a great job of pitting the two together. Batman/The Shadow opens as the Dark Knight investigates the latest murder in Gotham City, only for the prime suspect to be Lamont Cranston, a man thought to have perished 50 years prior. That’s just the start of a whirlwind team-up.
As with so many books on this list, Batman/The Shadow is all about the creative team - writers Scott Snyder and Steve Orlando and artist Riley Rossmo. Sadly, that full team didn’t return for the follow-up series The Shadow/Batman, but the sequel is still an enjoyable read in its own right.

Even as the movie series floundered, the Predator franchise found a second life in comics during the ‘90s. That includes no fewer than three crossovers between the Dark Knight and the universe’s greatest hunter. For our money, the first is still the one to beat, as it features a terrific story by Watchmen’s Dave Gibbons and art by a pre-X-Men Andy and Adam Kubert.
Batman Versus Predator boasts a simple but very winning premise. A Yautja is running amok in Gotham, and Batman is forced to follow his bloody trail. The creators conjure up a terrific sense of atmosphere, and ultimately do a far better job of capitalizing on the idea of a Predator hunting in a bustling American metropolis than Predator 2.

Batman and Judge Dredd both have a deep commitment to upholding the law and maintaining order in their respective dystopian cities. One would think they’d get along famously. But not so much it turns out, as the first Batman/Judge Dredd crossover shows us. When Judge Death breaches the barriers between dimensions and forms an alliance with Scarecrow, these two costumed heroes will have to put aside their differences for the greater good. And boy do they have some differences…
DC and 2000 AD collaborated on three Batman/Judge Dredd crossovers in the ‘90s, but here again, our money is on the original. It’s really hard to top the appeal of having Dredd co-creator John Wagner involved, along with the surreal, brutal, and downright psychedelic artwork of Simon Bisley. This may just be the best-looking Batman crossover of all time.

Grendel isn’t necessarily the most famous character Batman has crossed paths with over the years, but it’s a pairing that just makes inherent sense. Matt Wagner’s Grendel saga is a meditation on violence and vengeance, two themes central to Batman’s world. And given that Wagner has worked with the Dark Knight solo plenty of times over the years, these characters together become two great tastes that taste great together.
Both the original 1993 crossover and its 1996 sequel are well worth reading. The first pits Batman against the original Grendel Hunter Rose, as the two clash in both the streets and Gotham’s polite society. The sequel shifts focus to Rose’s futuristic successor Grendel-Prime. Both stories are good enough to make you wish Grendel was a permanent part of Batman’s rogues gallery.

Warren Ellis andthe late, great John Cassadayjoined forces for one of DC’s greatest comics ever in the sprawling sci-fi epic Planetary. That series wound up spawning crossovers with both The Authority and the Justice League, but it’s the Batman crossover that truly stands out (in part because it’s the only one of the three to feature the entire creative team from the main series).
In Planetary/Batman, the cantankerous Elijah Snow and his team arrive in a Batman-less Gotham City on the trail of a mysterious killer. Soon, the barriers between worlds are breached, leading to encounters with a great many versions of the Caped Crusader. Half the fun of this crossover is in how it celebrates all eras of Batman’s history, from the classic Golden Age to the campy Silver Age to the brooding avenger of The Dark Knight Returns. This crossover is basically just an extended installment of the main series with a healthy dose of Batman thrown in, and that’s enough to result in one of the best Batman crossovers of all time.

As it happens, the best Batman crossover is also the most bizarre. Batman/Elmer Fudd Special is part of a larger line of mash-ups combining heroes of the DCU with iconic Looney Tunes characters. It’s also far and away the best, mining more out of the goofy premise than we could have ever imagined. This is one of the only comics to everscore a 10 in our IGN review.
The brilliance of Batman/Elmer Fudd is that it plays the pairing completely straight (which, in turn, leads to some truly hilarious moments). This is a 100% serious vision of Batman and Gotham City, one in which Elmer Fudd is cast as a tragic killer not unlike Marv from Sin City. The speech impediment is still there, but the character is pure fury and pathos.
Writer Tom King and artist Lee Weeks wind up wringing a huge amount of emotion and depth out of this sad and wistful yet still hilarious crossover. They’re a great team when they work with Batman alone (as evidenced by their recurring collaboration on DC’s 2016 Batman series), but somehow the addition of Elmer Fudd takes everything up a notch.

That Robot Giggling in the Superman Sneak Peek Is the Secret to James Gunn's Success,2025-04-04T01:17:53Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/that-robot-giggling-superman-sneak-peek-trailer-secret-james-gunn-success,"With the wide release of the five-minuteSuperman sneak peekthat was first shown at CinemaCon earlier this week, one thing stands out even more than Krypto’s lovable (if painful for Superman) hijinks: It’s the fact that James Gunn understands the most important thing he can do for his reboot of not just the Man of Steel, but the entire DC universe, is to make us care about the characters. All of the characters, great and small, Kryptonian and human, canine and, yes, even robot.Gigglingrobots.

The extended preview features footage from the film that we’ve seen before, including of course Kal-El’s incredibly cute super dog arriving on the icy scene when his master is at a real low point. But it expands on that sequence fromthe film’s first trailer, showing us that Krypto is very much the troublemaker Gunn has described him to be. Yes, Superman is bloodied and beaten, pleading with Krypto to take him “home,” but all the pup wants to do is play. And he makes this point by jumping on the hurt Supes with all of his super-dog strength, and even dragging Kal-El’s leg up into an extremely awkward yet entirely believable pose. “Play with me, Dad!” he’s saying, in deeds if not words. It’s all very funny and it makes you love Krypto even more than you already did. Oh yes, you will believe that a super-powered dog can fly – and be lovable.
But Supermanishurt, and Krypto finally gets it, bringing Kal to the Fortress of Solitude. And that’s where we meet that giggling robot, who is one of the keys to understanding why James Gunn is so good at what he does. But before we get to that, consider that the first time we ever saw Gunn’s version of the Last Son of Krypton in action, he was in bad shape – beaten up, bleeding, needing hisdogto save him. And we don’t yet know who dished out this punishment either, so this first image of Gunn’s version of Superman battered and broken is not for the benefit of getting a villain over. There’s no “look how scary this antagonist is because they beat the hell out of the Man of Steel.” The purpose of beginning the entire marketing push for this film is to show Superman in dire straits and in need of help. It’s a far cry from the typical introduction of any superhero, let alonethesuperhero, and yet it makes perfect sense coming from Gunn.
It’s the Harrison Ford Syndrome. Which isn’t so much a syndrome as it is a legitimate strength of Ford’s on screen persona. Either way, think about how badly Indiana Jones gets roughed up. We don’t love him because he’s so good at fighting; it’s because he’s tired and in pain just like the rest of us. Think about the scared-as-shit look on Ford’s face when he was on the run in The Fugitive, the desperate man leaping off of a dam en route to prove his innocence. Think about the hurt on Han Solo’s face, the fully bruised ego when he thought Leia was into Luke and not him at the start of Empire. It’s an everyman appeal that few actors have ever really been able to pull off. Honestly, it might just be Ford and Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley that do it completely right. The point is, seeing your heroes beat up a little bit kind of makes you love them even more, especially when they rise to the occasion later to be, you know,heroes, despite everything they’ve been through.
Gunn knows this, and he has a track record of putting his characters through the ringer. Think back to the first time we met the Guardians of the Galaxy. The first trailer for that film shows that nobody knows Star-Lord’s name and that it stings a little. And yes, Star-Lord was a little known character from the depths of Marvel’s roster, and Superman is… well, it’s almost apples to oranges, but Gunn’s approach is exactly the same here. Let’s put some dents in our main character as quickly as we can. Let’s meet a protagonist at a moment when they’renotheroic, not saving the day, when they don’t even have the upper hand – that’s part of what makes Gunn’s superhero work resonate as well as anybody’s ever been able to.
So giving us a Superman who right off the bat has broken ribs, a jacked-up bladder, and is in awful pain even when/because his robots are healing him… it’s a very Gunn choice, and it goes a long way to getting us invested in his version of a character who, let’s not forget, has had like 10 movies and 15 TV shows or something at this point and is older than your grandparents. Superman and all his pals have been around forever, so why should we care about yet another version of his story?
And not for nothing, it’s important to remember that a significant criticism has been lobbed at Superman over the years saying his invulnerability and squeaky clean boy scout-ness are just plain boring. He was, after all, created to be the best of us, but crafting interesting narratives around an overpowered alien with only a single weakness can start to get hard after a century. So howdoyou make this familiar story engaging? Opening on a shot of a damaged Kal-El is a great start, but we still need to fall for the supporting cast.
And that brings us back to the giggling robot. Once Krypto gets his dad into the Fortress (which is a cool re-thinking of the classic Richard Donner ice-crystal Fortress of Solitude, only in this case one that grows out of the snowy landscape on command), the robots take custody of Superman as they carry the injured hero in to treat his wounds. In the comics we know that the ‘bot known asKelex is usually the main caretaker of the Fortress, although here we see the main robot has the simple designation of “4” on the Superman-shield on his chest.
As they tend to Superman, 4 (voiced by Alan Tudyk) introduces the newest robot of the group: “Meet 12. She’s new.” Superman nods to her weakly, and 12 practically blushes, despite being made of metal, as she giggles and says “Oh, he looked at me!”
12 has just that one line of dialogue (we're not sure who’s voicing the character but it’s gotta be someone we know, right?), but we're already so invested in her and these other robots that we're a little embarrassed to admit it. 4 also tells Kal-El that there’s no need to thank them for their service because they have “no consciousness whatsoever. Merely automatons here to serve.” But you know what? We're calling bullshit on that right now, because you can be guaranteed that half of us are going to be crying when we see the movie and one of these robots gets killed (something that in fact has already been teased in the first trailer). There’s also something about Tudyk’s delivery of those lines, like he’s dripping with sarcasm. No consciousness my red-briefs-clad-butt.
So even while comics fans can dig in and try to figure out if 4 is Kelex or how Superman’s biology works (he has intestines!) or whatever other lore or Easter egg stuff comes to mind, Gunn isn’t actually that concerned with that stuff. At minimum, we feel comfortable saying it doesn’t seem like his first priority. Yes, he understands the geeky things, he’s a fan himself and he’s read the comics – and loves them, no doubt – but what he’s doing here is building out little character moments and beats that will make us actually care about these people. And robots. And dogs!
This isn’t gonna be aSuperman movieas much as it is a James Gunn movie, and we can’t wait."
Dark Regards Is a Comic With a Truly Ludicrous Back-Story,2025-03-12T14:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/dark-regards-comic-oni-press-exclusive-preview,"Dark Regards is easily the most intriguing new indie comics to come along in quite some time. It's a book whose back-story is as wild and crazy as the comic itself. But you can be the judge in our exclusive preview of Dark Regards #1.

Check out the slideshow gallery below for an exclusive look inside the new series, but beware of some NSFW language ahead!
Dark Regards is the brainchild of comedian/writer/musician Dave Hill and artist Artyom Topilin (Cruel Universe, I Hate This Place). The four-issue series is inspired by Hill's own experiences forming a fictional Satanic metal band called Witch Taint and the unexpected spiral of chaos that ensued.
Here's Oni Press' official description of the series:
Two decades ago, Dave Hill and his first band set out to rock their high school auditorium in a fury of heavy metal hellfire. They failed miserably. Years later, Dave has made a new life for himself as a rising star in the New York comedy scene – a career where getting laughed at on stage is the entire point and not just a tragic consequence. But when Dave's metal ambitions are re-awakened by the über self-serious, “Satanic” genre of Norwegian black metal, Dave creates a ridiculously hyperbolic alter ego and a band to match that, together, reignite the spark of his forgotten rock 'n roll fantasy. But when Dave's internet-fueled rumors of Witch Taint – a metal band “so extreme that you must remove all sharp objects from the immediate area” when their music is played – spreads all the way to Europe, his story will spiral dangerously out of control as Norway's most extreme black metal butchers come to reap their revenge . . . and put everything and everyone Dave holds dear in the crosshairs (of their axes, which, truth be told, don't actually have crosshairs, but, hey, it's a metaphor).
“A few years back, I sat down in my underwear late one night and decided to let my obsession with Norwegian black metal run wild by emailing a Norwegian black metal record label, telling them all the bands on their label sucked despite the fact that I had never listened to any of them, and suggesting they sign my extremely extreme black metal band Witch Taint, which had yet to record any music and didn't even exist beyond the band name I'd just made up on the spot,” said Hill in a statement. “This first email led to months of correspondence with the record label that I never intended for anyone to see. But the Internet being the Internet, eventually a lot of people saw it and things got nuts. Now, beyond my wildest dreams, this story has become my first comic book series Dark Regards, written by me and illustrated by the amazing Artyom Topilin. If you don't devour every single issue, you are basically insane.”
Dark Regards #1 is priced at $4.99 and will be released on May 13, 2025.

20 Favorite Female Authors Picked by the Women at IGN,2025-03-22T01:16:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/womens-history-month-ign-staff-picks-favorite-authors,"As March marksWomen’s History Monthin the US, we wanted to highlight the women here at IGN. Last year, we highlighted some staff picks ofgames, movies, and TV. This year we switched gears to another favorite hobby: reading.

When the women of IGN were asked, “Who are your favorite women authors?” – no easy question for avid readers – a fascinating list sprung to life that spanned genres and styles. Let’s see which authors and comic artists were included as we celebrate both the women of IGNandtheir favorite women authors!
Her stories of love, grief, and understanding the flawed human existence are nothing short of excellent. –Marhyan Franzen

Kelly Sue DeConnick has been battling in the trenches of the “boys club” of comics for years. When she wrote for Marvel, she was the one who brought the title of Captain Marvel to Carol Danvers, a legacy brought over into the MCU years later with her name in the credits as a consultant for the films. Outside of the Big Two, she's been an ever-present voice in indie comics with works like Pretty Deadly (if you're looking for a more mystical western theme) and Bitch Planet (if you want a more sci-fi, dystopian, feminist vibe). She continues with her current project, FML, from Dark Horse Comics for those looking for a more supernatural vibe in our stories. If you haven't read anything she's written yet, you're doing yourself a disservice: DeConnick is an incredible writer and an amazing human. –Chelsea Reed
Notable works: Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman Historia, Pretty Deadly, Bitch Planet, FML
Sarah Rose Etter writes weird but clear-eyed books for weird people (like me). Though she’s only published two novels thus far, both have been among my favorite books of the year they came out. The Book of X, about a woman born to generational meat farmers and women with their stomach twisted into a knot, was surreal and painfully relatable; Ripe, about a young woman suffering through her job at a recognizably psychotic San Francisco startup and haunted by an ever-present void, swapped that formula (and also ends not unlike Rose Glass’ film Saint Maud). I hope she writes 100 more books like these in my lifetime. –Leanne Butkovic
Notable works: Ripe, The Book of X
I am excited to see thefilm adaptationof this feminist medieval tale and to see Charli XCX portray Rosa! –Kelly Pham
Notable works: The 100 Nights of Hero
It's unlikely this is the first time you're being recommended N.K. Jemisin's incredible The Broken Earth Trilogy. Though her other fantasy novels deserve attention in their own right, Jemisin's captivating writing, characters, and creative magic system in The Broken Earth Trilogy (specifically in the second book, The Obelisk Gate) make it the easiest to recommend. Her surprising playfulness with storytelling in The Fifth Season may be confusing for some at first, but stick with it – the payoff is fantastic. It follows Essun, a woman trying to hunt down her husband who murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter while trying to survive a recurring cataclysmic event and hide that she has powers to manipulate the very earth around her. It's an incredible, Hugo Award-winning ride. –Miranda Sanchez
Notable works: The Broken Earth Trilogy (The Fifth Season), The City We Became
It's astounding just how much T. Kingfisher publishes in a year but my adventure-loving heart appreciates the number of Kingfisher's consistently interesting retakes on classic fairy tales and horror stories. Kingfisher's stories tend to skew toward gothic horror and dark fantasy, but even still, her comedic pacing and thoughtfully written characters provide a sometimes needed balance for various novels' heavy themes. Whether it's the slow and creeping exploration of emotional abuse in ""What Moves the Dead"" or her exquisite Saint of Steel fantasy romance series that deals with personal identity and loss, I've come away with a full heart (and feeling a little creeped out). –MS
Notable works: Nettle & Bone, What Moves the Dead, Paladin's Grace
Maybe it’s overly obvious to be recommending the most recent Nobel Prize winner for Literature – even members of BTS celebrated her accomplishment on Instagram – but all of the praise lauded on Han Kang is apparent when you crack open one of her novels. Like most people, I was introduced to her work through The Vegetarian when it was translated into English in 2015 and was immediately taken by its disturbingly mesmerizing plot about a housewife who stops eating meat, to the confusion and dismay of those around her, and eventually food altogether. (It’s even more aesthetically arresting knowing that it released in South Korea a full eight years prior.) I’ve followed her ever since, from the thematically similar Greek Lessons to the true-to-life South Korean political atrocities in Human Acts and We Do Not Part, and I cannot implore you enough to read Han Kang. She is a genius andabsolute badass. –LB
Notable works: We Do Not Part, The Vegetarian, Human Acts, Greek Lessons
Newly published but already on her way to releasing a third novel, Yume Kitasei is an imaginative sci-fi writer with a promising career ahead of her. While many of my favorite sci-fi writers tend to have expansive series, Kitasei's one-off stories delightfully build their worlds quickly, and their engaging stories move even faster. Her debut, The Deep Sky, is a neat murder mystery aboard a tech-filled spaceship bound for the hopeful future home of humanity that was hard to put down. Her follow-up, The Stardust Grail, is an Indiana Jones-style adventure as its protagonist races her enemies to find an ancient alien artifact that is the key to her friend's survival but potentially the doom of her own. Both are lovely and imaginative, and I can't wait to read her next novel that's out later this fall. –MS
Notable works: The Deep Sky, Stardust Grail
Perfect for kids just getting started in fantasy. –MF
Notable works: Ella Enchanted
Sarah J. Mass is a queen in the fantasy romance genre who constantly leaves me jaw-dropped with everything she has created. Her world-building and storytelling are so incredibly detailed, that she quickly became one of my favorite fantasy authors. She’s generally best known for the remarkable series A Court of Thorns and Roses – currently a five-book series with more releases coming – which dives into a story about a young woman who ends up living in a magical realm. In it, she finds her confidence and strength while battling through internal and external wars among the Fae – who are basically humans with super strength, magical powers, and immortality. Her first series was Throne of Glass, an amazing eight-book series that started her fantasy writing and world-building when she was only a teenager. Her latest series, Crescent City, has three books so far, with a fourth to come. All three of her series take place in the fantasy world of the Fae, so when readers are fans of one of her series, they tend to enjoy the others as well. Mass’ ability to develop strong characters and exciting twists leaves her stories equally entwined with the fantastical elements of the story and the romance side of things.

There seemingly isn't a genre Silvia Moreno-Garcia won't tackle. Whether it's a historical romance with a touch of fantasy in The Beautiful Ones or a dark vampire adventure set in Mexico City in Certain Dark Things, Moreno-Garcia nails it every time. Some of her romance-forward stories feel a little similar in their dynamics if you read them back to back, but it's easy to make sure that doesn't happen if you're new to her small library of published works. The majority of her works tend to skew toward dark historical fantasy set throughout North America – and, more often than not, in Mexico, which is wonderfully refreshing. Anything she publishes has a guaranteed spot on my limited bookshelf space. –MS

Erin Morganstern's two novels, The Night Circus and The Starless Sea, read like falling into a dream. Morganstern is another of the very few authors whose books I will not only buy in hardcover instantly but also grab multiple copies to collect the various editions. The Night Circus is a luscious, historical fantasy romance about two magicians trained since childhood for their inevitable battle against one another at a mysterious circus. It's guaranteed to break me out of a reading slump whenever I pick it up again and was the book that drew me back into regularly reading as an adult. (Sometimes you've gotta not look at a screen, as much as I love spending my time playing video games.)  Her second novel, The Starless Sea, is a winding, enchanting story about stories. It begins in the world we know before protagonist Zachary finds his way into an underground realm that serves as the library of all stories and it's in danger. Like her debut, The Starless Sea is wonderfully written and best paired with a warm cup of tea. –MS

I get a little giddy when I hear that a new Helen Oyeyemi book is on its way. A truly singular voice, Oyeyemi is hard to pin down in a way that’s like – stick with me here – trying to chase down a wispy ghost that’s purposefully messing with you but you’re still having a great time anyway. Her novels are fantastical, but aren’t really fantasy at all; a chunk of them are inspired by Hans Christian Anderson folktales, but the look and feel could not be further from their progenitors. (Gingerbread, for example, is vaguely Hansel and Gretel-ish put through a capitalist meat grinder.) Mostly they’re all fever dream adventures that nuke the rules of literary fiction. As another great writer Alexandra Kleemansaid to The Nation, Oyeyemi’s work has “the discombobulating quality of walking through a moving vehicle while carrying a full-to-the-brim cup of very hot tea.” –LB

Sue Lynn Tan's debut, Daughter of the Moon Goddess, is a gorgeous reimagining and expansion of the Chinese legend of the moon goddess and continues with its follow-up, Heart of the Sun Warrior. Together, they are the most delicious romantic adventures I've read. The duology eloquently gives context to Chinese mythology for those unfamiliar with it while keeping the pace of the action steady. As the first book's title suggests, the hidden daughter of the exiled moon goddess, Xingyin, takes the role of protagonist when she's sent into hiding among the Celestial Kingdom while her mother must continue her imprisonment on the moon. Determined to set her mother free, Xingyin goes on an epic, inspiring adventure to set things right. Tan's complex characters and strong understanding of romantic pacing make these instant standouts among romantic fantasy novels. –MS

Rebecca Yarros’sEmpyrean seriesis a striking adult fantasy romance that follows a young woman’s experience going to a war college for dragon riders. If you can imagine humans working with dragons to prepare for war, you can guess (correctly) that it’s brutal right off the bat. Even though violence takes a prominent, integral role in the books, it doesn’t overtake the importance of the storyline itself, the characters, and the world-building. Yarros does a phenomenal job creating relatable characters who deal with serious challenges, both physical and mental, they need to learn to overcome, but there’s a theme of friendship and support throughout. The romance is woven into the story in an organic way that complements the plot well, while still keeping the excitement in the fantasy world. Even for those not interested in the romance side of it, you’ll likely end up adoring the characters’ experiences together and crave more of it the further you read. Yarros has this ability to create such complex storylines with so many unexpected twists and turns, leaving you constantly hyped. She reveals more of her worlds as she goes on through the books, and when I say she’ll crush your world and then rebuild it (hopefully), I mean it. You’ll be surprised how attached you get to dragons and think of them as real people. The Empyrean series is a five-book series and the third book was released on January 21, 2025, with two still to come. –JW

Daredevil: Born Again Episode 3 Review,2025-03-12T01:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/daredevil-born-again-episode-3-review,"Warning: this review contains full spoilers for Episode 3 of Daredevil: Born Again!

The third episode of Daredevil: Born Again comes aftera riveting two-part opener, so it’s understandable that things are now cooling down a bit this week. There’s a focus on Hector Ayala’s trial that leads to all manner of legal twists and turns, but even the twistiest lawyer drama isn’t exactly the most thrilling thing to watch. Matt Murdock arguing the case for a vigilante certainly makes for a lot of interesting material on a thematic level, and all of the performances remain top-notch, but there’s a disappointing lack of superhero intrigue because Daredevil doesn’t make an appearance. Still, this episode creates a complex and dangerous dynamic between Murdock and the police force, and the shocking ending stayed with me long after the credits rolled.
Even though I came into this episode knowing the tragedy that befalls White Tiger in the comics, I was still shocked to see him abruptly assassinated at the end of the episode. By someone wearing a Punisher logo, no less. Above all else, the show genuinely makes you feel the immense loss of Hector Ayala as not only a superhero but as a human being. Actor Kamar de los Reyes’ opening monologue had me getting emotional over singing frogs, which made hearing them over the end credits even more heartbreaking.
This is a bit of a dicey episode for our main character. It’s clear to see that talking to Ayala makes him reflect on his own vigilantism as Daredevil, though Murdock seems to be in a place where he’s content only helping people as an attorney and not as a superhero. Will Hector’s unjust, violent end be enough to make him put on the mask again? The way he keeps fidgeting with that broken horn certainly makes me think so.
But how Murdock handles the trial didn’t work for me. It’s far too reckless and theatrical, even for him. I didn’t buy his reasoning explaining away his cavalier actions. Outing Ayala as the White Tiger ends up winning him the case, but he of all people should know how dangerous it is to reveal another hero’s secret identity. (Case in point: a gunman was able to wait outside Ayala’s home and murder him when he stepped out onto the street.) Murdock’s tactics are especially shortsighted when you consider how Mayor Fisk ran a whole campaign demonizing vigilantes. Even the judge calls out Murdock for being a huge hypocrite and he brushes it off. Also, having Nicky Torres flake out on the witness stand is an odd twist because it’s never explained what they had on him or how they even got in contact with him while he was in witness protection. I appreciate the writers trying to liven up the courtroom drama, but it comes at the expense of Murdock’s credibility as a lawyer.
What we said about the Daredevil: Born Again series premiere
Daredevil: Born Again does a bang up job with ol’ Hornhead’s long-awaited return. The show captures the signature drama and brutality of Netflix’s Daredevil series while taking the story of Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk in a bold (and surprisingly topical) new direction. It’s to Marvel’s credit that they’ve set up such a gripping face-off not between Daredevil and Kingpin but between their civilian-facing personas. But for all the new show does right, there are still a few quibbles to be had – mainly, the lack of supporting characters who pop in these first two episodes and the fact that we are yet again getting a story about Murdock giving up being Daredevil. –Joshua Yehl
Read the complete Daredevil: Born Again series premiere review
This is a quieter episode for Wilson Fisk, as his relationship with Vanessa continues to languish and his allies from his Kingpin days refuse to let him escape his old life. Looks like the police chief was right when he told Fisk, “Once a thug, always a thug” in episode 2. Becoming mayor has truly changed the character. He went from feeling like his status as the Kingpin of crime made him the most powerful man in the world to now calling crime lords petty, squabbling vermin. This, of course, mirrors Murdock’s state of mind, where he believes he’s moved on to something better, when in reality he’ll never be able to escape his true self.
The Punisher’s presence continues to grow as we see another cop with a skull tattoo (on his neck) and Ayala’s murderer, as previously mentioned, wearing the symbol. I have to imagine that these men have appropriated the Punisher logo and the actual Punisher, Frank Castle, has nothing to do with them. I hope this means he’ll be making his big entrance next episode, and I imagine he won’t be happy with what others have done in his name.
Other Thoughts
The third episode of Daredevil: Born Again is a bit underwhelming compared to the great one-two punch of the premiere. The trial of Hector Ayala plays a key role in making Murdock do some self reflection, and Kamar de los Reyes does a fantastic job conveying the heart and soul of his wrongly accused vigilante. But the legal drama alone isn’t enough to pick up the slack of a Daredevil-less episode. There’s a lot of setup for future conflicts, most notably the jaw-dropping ending, so at the very least this episode does the job of creating excitement for what’s to come."
The Internet Has Thoughts on Who Sadie Sink Should Play in Tom Holland's Spider-Man 4,2025-03-14T16:41:33Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/the-internet-has-thoughts-on-who-sadie-sink-should-play-in-tom-hollands-spider-man-4,"So, you might’ve heard this little tidbit of news lately:Stranger ThingsstarSadie Sink is officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the next Spider-Man. But now comes the speculation: who, exactly, will she play in Spider-Man 4?

You’ve got theories, I’ve got theories, and we’re not alone — the whole internet’s got theories. Needless to say, fans' minds are racing. So what do they think? Well, let’s go over the most distinct possibilities (and, for that matter, impossibilities).
It seems as though most folks find the idea of Sink ending up being the, quote unquote, real Mary Jane Watson due to her red hair to be a bit silly. “Michelle Jones isthe MCU’s real MJ,” one fan wrote on Reddit — and most fans in the thread agreed. Though another Redditor noted the studio might cast Sink in the role as a “bold attempt to win back those who prefer classic Spider-Man.” The obvious choice is not always the best one, folks.
Zendayahas played the MCU’s new MJ since 2017’s Spider-Man Homecoming, and despite not being the standard red-haired Mary Jane fans know from the comics andSam Raimi’s previous trilogy, modern day Spidey lovers have generally accepted her as their MJ. So it seems as though they’ll keep her around, especially considering she is said to be, at minimum, coming back for a cameo for this yet untitled sequel toNo Way Home.
Some fans think Sink may end up playing one of Peter Parker’s other love interests, Gwen Stacey. After all, wigsdoexist. “Much to the surprise(and potentially dismay) of everyone,” one user said about Sink in the role previously played by Emma Stone in Marc Webb’s The Amazing Spider-Man duo. “I absolutely would not want to see [that] sincewe’ve already gotten a Gwen Stacy/Peter Parker love storyand I definitely have no interest in seeing Spider-Gwen right now,” another Redditor added.
Spider-Gwen is a distinct part of the animated Spider-Verse, where she is voiced by Hailee Steinfeld, so it seems like fans prefer to follow her story there for the time being. Consideringhow major the Peter and Gwen love story wasin Webb’s Spider-Man films — itdidgive way to a lengthy real-life relationship between Stone and Andrew Garfield, who played Parker/Spider-Man — it makes sense that fans wouldn’t really want to see that rehashed. There’s a ton of Spidey territory to cover between his many comic adventures and appearances, so giving Sink something different to do is most likely the key to making her inclusion a success.
Another theory folks have been throwing around is the idea that Sink might end up playing another famous MCU redhead: X-Men’s Jean Grey, also known as the Phoenix. She was played as an adult by Famke Janssen in five films in Fox’s X-Men franchise. Later, she was portrayed as a teenager by Sophie Turner in2019’s Dark Phoenix.
One user on Reddit considered that idea “too obvious,” while another agreed and added: “Weird to intro [her] in SM4.” That said, a third fan noted that there could always be more castings in the future that could lead tomore mutants joining the fold for Spider-Man 4. Others have doubts about a mutant showing up with true relevance in a Spider-Man focused film. “I just don't seeone of the core X-Men getting introduced in a Spider-Man movie,” a fan wrote.
But it seems as though the most popular guess — and potentially the best guess as well — is a lesser known character called Firestar, a redhead mutant named Angelica Jones who is a mainstay in the X-Men, as well as the 1981 animated seriesSpider-Man and His Amazing Friendswhere she debuted. She could definitely be that “something different” I was talking about — and lots of fans seem excited about the prospect of bringing her into the story as it stands within the MCU.
Indeed, fans seem particularly excited at the idea of bringing those Amazing Friends back together. “She'll be a college student alongside Peter and their friend/partner Bobby Drake. They'll all live in the same apartment too,” one user commented. “This will bethe adaptation of Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends we've all been waiting for, lol.” Another agreed, “I would lovea Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends team-up!” while a third added: “If they did the Amazing Friends lineup,people would lose their minds.”
Firestar started as a Spider-Man character, but eventually broke off and expanded into her own story that included alliances with the New Mutants, Hellions, and the Avengers themselves. So considering her origins, it might just be the perfect character to introduce. However, one fandidmention, “If Firestar, why not Jean?” and to be fair, they have a point. But right now, it’s anyone’s guess who Sink will end up making her MCU debut as. Only time will tell.

My Hero Academia: Vigilantes Premiere Review,2025-04-07T15:45:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/my-hero-academia-vigilantes-premiere-review,"The first episode of My Hero Academia: Vigilantes is now streaming on Crunchyroll.

My Hero Academia is nearing its conclusion, but its first seven seasons – with their focus on the heroes-in-training of U.A. High School – have only shown us a sliver of a fascinating world where most people have superpowers (a.k.a. Quirks) and some parlay their Quirk into a lucrative career. Enter My Hero Academia: Vigilantes, an adaptation of the manga of the same name written by Hideyuki Furuhashi and illustrated by Betten Court. This is both a spin-off and a prequel to the main show,, and it’s not only a worthy expansion of the My Hero Academia universe, but a dazzling anime whose visual style pays tribute to classic superhero comics.
The anime follows Koichi Haimawari, an 18-year-old with a desire to help people despite having a less-than-stellar Quirk. His power allows him to travel quickly across any flat surface – as long as he makes contact with that surface with at least three limbs. Unfortunately, he’s no Flash: at top speed, he only moves about as fast as a bicycle. In many ways, Koichi is like My Hero Academia lead Deku: Both are big-hearted optimists and admirers of the world’s greatest superhero, All Might. In others, he’s a different kind of superhero for MHA: An everyman. The premiere does a lot of work to establish Koichi’s relatability.  Sure he has a Quirk, but it’s not one that’s useful for superheroics. He tries to help people, but cowers when things get too real.
Even in the first episode, it is clear Vigilantes is giving audiences a different perspective on My Hero Academia. This is not a show about big villains with grand schemes fighting the A-listers. Its concerns are smaller, like the frustration of a convenience-store work being robbed by a small-time vandal with Wolverine claws. These are the villains that aren't prioritized or even acknowledged by cops or heroes. It’s in line with the parent series: The best parts of MHA’s world-building involve the way regular people view hero society; in its earliest goings, it portrayed heroes as celebrities who sometimes cared more about endorsements than saving lives. Vigilantes promises to be a fascinating new spin on that idea, with a street-level view of a world where superpowers don’t just exist, but are common.
Without a doubt, the visuals are the main draw of the series so far. Director Kenichi Suzuki (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders) and the animators at Bones Studio B (Mob Psycho 100) give Vigilante an art style that is distinct from the flagship series – even compared to other series adapted from manga, this one has distinctly comic-book-y aesthetic. The character outlines are thick, the shading is striking, and the colors pop. Every frame is vibrant; like the Spider-Verse movies, sounds effects are rendered as onscreen onomatopoeia. (“Bam!” “Pow!,” etc.). The first episode doesn't reach the level of epic action of My Hero Academia, but these touches make even small alley brawls feel unique and dynamic.
Vigilantes is its own, smaller-scale story completely unconcerned with top heroes and U.A. High School. But some familiar faces show up nonetheless. Fortunately, these cameos and guest appearances (in the premiere, at least) aren’t shoehorned in as reminders of Vigilantes’ roots. Instead, they’re just another example of the fully realized, lived-in world in which these episodes take place in.
My Hero Academia: Vigilantes is a worthy spin-off of the popular superhero anime. Its small scale story and focus on street-level heroism expands the show's world in interesting ways, while introducing a relatable, everyman hero. The anime boasts a dazzling art direction that translate the vibrant colors and lively onomatopoeia of a classic superhero comic to the TV screen."
"Capcom Was on Its Knees After Resident Evil 6, Now Monster Hunter Wilds Cements Its Golden Era — Here's How It Did It",2025-03-12T12:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-golden-age-the-rise-and-fall-resident-evil-monster-hunter-wilds,"With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its wayandits audience.

Capcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.
But in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.
2016 was a bad year for Capcom.
The big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.
This was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.
All of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .
Achieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.
Capcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4.
2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema.
Unfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.
“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.
This directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op.
This downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.
But it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.
This slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.
It was clear something needed to change.
By the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability.
While neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.
“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”
Those constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6.
""We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V,"" Nakayama says. ""And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title.""
All this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards.“There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.
“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”
The team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.
There was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master.
“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.”
Street Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series.
While they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.
While Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.
Around the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience.
“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”
If you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.
“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”
Itsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance.
No other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened.
Firstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.
“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”
Monster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.
This created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.
But the reality was that Monster Hunterdidhave fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.
Released in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.
“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”
It was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”
It wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world.
“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”Tsujimoto says.
One important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.
This explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.
“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”
Monster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call.
“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&D teams were divided into R&D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”
Takeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.
There were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.
“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.
The game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series.
But Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time.
“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.
The result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history.
Naturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?
Ampo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”
But despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.
Around the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.
“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.”
Itsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.
The 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. ""Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively,"" Itsuno says. ""When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”
This vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should.
Ampo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, ""So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.”
This meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.
“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”
Since 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.
Focusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat.
But what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.
Many of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever.
When asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”
Monster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”

Side Quest Review,2025-03-26T07:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/side-quest-review-apple-tv-plus-mythic-quest,"Side Quest is now streaming on Apple TV+.

Over the course of four seasons (the most recent of which just ended),Mythic Questhas built a fully realized, ripe-for-exploration universe around the sturdy core of a classic workplace sitcom. This is part of the reason why it’s one of the best, most reliable TV comedies of the streaming era – it doesn’t hurt that the Apple TV+ series set in the world of video-game development is also extremely funny. Hot on the heels of its fourth-season finale comes Side Quest, an entertaining anthology series that delves further into the lives of the people who make, play, and love Mythic Quest’s namesake MMORPG. The parent series has wandered down these kinds of one-off detours several times, and almost always found a worthwhile destination – most notably the first-season highlight “A Dark Quiet Death.” Yet, at a mere four episodes, Side Quest’s expansion pack feels like it ends just as it gets going.
Let’s get this out of the way: Nothing in Side Quest surpasses or even comes close to “A Dark Quiet Death”’s level of quality. It’s never as substantial as that exceptional piece of television, but the spinoff is still a good elaboration on Mythic Quest’s themes of community and boundaries. And while it’s not like Side Quest contains overly complicated links to previous episodes or puzzles to solve, some details will get lost in translation if it’s your first encounter with the fantastical realms maintained by Ian Grimm, Poppy Li, and company.
Of the four episodes, the first, “Song and Dance,” has the strongest ties to the Mythic Quest office: It follows beleaguered art director Phil (Derek Waters) in his continually thwarted attempts to disconnect for a few days. Having appeared in six episodes across seasons 2 and 3, Phil is enough of a fixture that viewers will immediately recognize his downtrodden aura – Ian (Rob McElhenney) has a history of throwing last-minute assignments at him and expecting immediate results. Ian doesn’t respect anyone else’s free time, and as we see in “Song and Dance,” that carries over to Phil’s luxury vacation with his girlfriend Maude, played byPen15’s Anna Konkle.
Thirty minutes of Phil having his time off disrupted by calls from Ian would get stale quickly, so I’m grateful that “Song and Dance” is more about digging deeper into his personal life and psyche. This enriches the Mythic Quest universe: All we know about Phil prior to “Song and Dance” is how put-upon he is, but there’s no interior life in a running gag. We’ve seen Ian cross work-life boundaries before; it might seem like there isn’t any new ground to cover here. But Phil’s low self-esteem adds an extra dimension to the dilemma. Konkle contributes significantly to that feeling, too, hitting notes that are equal parts frustrated and loving – never too smothering, and never too cold, either.
The remaining three episodes distance themselves from Ian and the MQ regulars, which lends some additional novelty to the proceedings. Whereas Mythic Quest has boasted some big-name guest stars in the past – Anthony Hopkins, William Hurt, and Joe Manganiello, to just name a few – Side Quest avoids stunt casting, which suits the types of stories it’s telling. Not to say that this is a cast of fresh faces and newcomers, but there also isn’t anyone whose established star power or fame pulls focus or feels like an odd fit in such humble surroundings.
This also feels in line with the ways Side Quest explores how we form community through art. Games are only one piece of the picture: The second episode, “Pull List,” takes place in a comic-book store. This blind-box stacking, Magic: The Gathering card-slinging spiritual cousin to High Fidelity (the John Cusackmovieandthe Zoë Kravitz Hulu show) is my favorite of the four episodes, but part of me thinks that picking a favorite is a Rorschach Test for your relationship to Mythic Quest. In this case, it underlines how much the ensemble-focused episodes like season 4’s murder mystery, “The Villain’s Feast,” tend to stand out and resonate. (Besides: The more I sit with it, the more my Side Quest ranking changes.)
As the staff and clientele of Comics Galore! trade punchy dialogue about whether Superman or Goku would win in a fight and what characters they claim as Black (Elmo: yes, Big Bird: no), Mythic Quest lore blends deeper our pop-culture world. Written by Leann Bowen and Javier Scott, “Pull List” digs into what makes someone a fan, the pissing matches that sometimes result from trying to prove that fandom, and the growing tension between multiple characters coveting the store’s lone copy of the latest Mythic Quest tie-in comic. It also sets itself apart from the rest of the anthology visually, with playful graphics that pull comic–book imagery into the real world.
Each episode has its own distinct visual identity, but the overall look is still unmistakably Mythic Quest. That’s especially true of the season finale, “The Last Raid,” a screenlife story à laUnfriendedorSearchingdepicting a milestone raid for a long-running guild. In-game graphics punctuate regular Mythic Quest episodes, and here they take center stage as one group of online friends face their greatest test: the way their IRL relationships are developing (or faltering). It’d make a great double feature with the recently released, staging-a-Shakespearean-tragedy-in-GTA-Online documentaryGrand Theft Hamlet: Another sympathetic, nonjudgmental (but still funny) depiction of how video games can be a lifeline for the socially isolated.
Side Quest’s ability to explore so much new terrain through the lens of a single, fictional video game is why I wish it were longer. And while the scope may be there, and all four episodes are engaging and thought-provoking, they ultimately lack the oomph of “A Dark Quiet Death” or its second-season counterpart, “Backstory!” It falls plainly on one end of the Goldilocks principle that plagues many streaming series: Not enough episodes to satisfy our hunger for more Mythic Quest; too slight to stick with you after the credits roll. This is no more apparent than in the third episode, which imparts its message early on but lacks a punch to carry it home. Its story of a cellist learning to separate her passion and her profession (with help from the Mythic Quest score) is sweet, but not much else. Still, it’s a credit to the creative team and performers that I became emotionally invested in all of these characters' lives within the span of 30 minutes. If only there were a few more chances to do so.
It’s no surprise that a Mythic Quest spinoff would be a funny and often heartfelt exploration of community. The four episodes of Side Quest all take on different elements of the MQ universe, tapping into struggles with work-life balance and how a job can consume your life. The first episode eases us with a familiar character, but the three that follow aren’t afraid to delve into new settings populated by unfamiliar faces. It’s an enjoyable and ambitious supplement to one of today’s best streaming comedies – but at only four episodes, Side Quest feels too slight, and unable to reach the high bar set by previous Mythic Quest one-offs."
Arkham Horror: The Board Game Buying Guide,2025-03-13T18:38:30Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/arkham-horror-the-board-game-buying-guide,"The Arkham Horror universe has a whole lot of games in its catalogue. In fact, there are so many to choose from that we’ve had to separate them into two guides. In this buying guide, we will go through the several families of board games. If you’re seeking information about the manydeck-building card gamesalso under the umbrella, you can click on over to ourArkham Horror: The Card Game Buying Guide.

Arkham Horror is an long-running franchise ofhorror board games. You and your fellow players embark on missions that involve a lot of communication to win. The games each have several pathways that can be taken depending on which roles, expansions, and campaigns you employ. These also make terrificsolo board gamesfor when you don't have a group on hand to spend an hour-plus playing a board game.
Want to skip the blurbs and go straight to the various games and expansions? Scroll through the catalog above. If you're interested in the nitty gritty of how all the items relate to one another and to the broad Arkham Horror universe in general, read on below.
Arkham Horror is acooperative board gamein which player teams work collectively against different sorts of terrors. You can take the journey through Arkham as one of six investigators to solve mysteries and defeat horrific beasts. The game has several campaigns to explore, and given the sizable luck component, whereby you have to roll to see if you pass certain objectives and bosses, along with the chance of chaos and occult trickery, well, the games are highly replayable.
But be warned: this is not an easy game. It takes a bit of time to set up and to teach to your group. The gameplay itself can last for multiple hours, or can be done fairly quickly if you and your ensemble of investigator partners aren’t lucky. (If you or your mates lose and there are fewer players than six, you can select another investigator to play as, but you’ll start over with that one, losing any additional stats that you’ve gained along the way. Dying kinda sucks, to be honest.) My first adventure with friends on the easiest campaign was disastrous. I’ve played it as asolo board game(yep, you can also do that here, too), but that didn’t go well, either. When you complete that first winning game, your whole party will cheer.
There are three expansions for the Arkham Horror: The Board Game. Each unlocks a different layer of depth to the base game.
The largest of the expansions is Under the Dark Waves. As the name suggests, this expansion is about the horrors that exist under the water. This big expansion brings eight new investigators on board for four new scenarios. It takes you out of the city and into the sea.
This is a medium-sized expansion that includes three new scenarios and three more investigators to travel through Arkham. Secrets of the Order opens up another neighborhood, so you'll explore French Hill while being mindful of the ghosts and monsters that may make your visit the opposite of a quaint French getaway.
Dead of Night is a smaller box expansion with a smaller price point to match. It has two more scenarios to add to your base game, plus four more investigators to help you navigate the horrors in the dead of the night.
There are a few other board games that act as their own separate Arkham universes. The games are not directly connected to Arkham Horror, so you don't need that base game to play them. Each of these games allows you and your friends to experience a different, stand-alone adventure within Arkham, using characters you may recognize from other iterations. Some of these titles are big enough to have expansions of their own.
Elder Sign was one of the first games in the Arkham Files franchise. It's adice-rolling board gamethat can be played by one to eight players. Of all the games in the Arkham Files, it’s the most accessible chance game. It is a separate standalone game with six physical companion expansions.
Gameplay is primarily governed by dice. While it’s not entirely like Yahtzee with monsters, rolling dice is the core driver of the game. You’ll have to roll dice to complete tasks and to work through six encounters. You roll dice depending on the stats of your chosen investigator to fight monsters, find clues, and work toward solving the mystery before time runs out.
Elder Sign has six expansions: Unseen Forces, Gates of Arkham, Omens of Ice, Grave Consequences, Omens of the Deep, and Omens of the Pharaoh. Grave Consequences is a standalone deck and can be played with or without the core game. The last expansion was released in 2018. It is currently unknown if there will be any more.
This is an app-drivendungeon crawler board gametake on the universe. The second edition is a standalone game that exists in the same universe as Eldrich Horror and Elder Sign. You can play it with one to five players using an app to help you through the narrative. The app guides you through setting up and playing the game. Narrative, roll results, and play direction can all be done in the app.
Personally, I dug playing with the combination of the tactical pieces and the app. And if you have to pause the game experience, the app allows you to come back later to finish where you left off. You’ll still have to set up your physical board game pieces when you play again, however, so you may want to take a picture to remember where everything should be.
There are two expansions for Mansions of Madness. Both of them are cooperative games that are guided by the app.
This expansion takes you to the depths of the jungle, where serpents and other Lovecraftian horrors will bring peril and pain to your adventure. Like the original, it is guided by an app, and you do need the base game to play it.
This expansion is significantly cheaper than the other one above. Beyond the Threshold opens two new investigators, two new scenarios, and an insanity gameplay element. Its low price point makes it the most accessible expansion to add to your game.
Unfathomable is about escaping a sea of monsters on a boat. It can be played with three to six players, though it’s best suited for groups of five or six. This game has a social deduction component, making it an immersive experience for larger groups. Someone is designated to be a traitor, and you won’t know who. It has Battlestar Galactica vibes to it, but in a Lovecraftian mythos atmosphere. Sessions take multiple hours while you navigate the game trying to figure out who among you is there to help and who wants you dead, while simultaneously trying to escape alive.
Unfathomable is a completely different experience than other games in the Arkham catalogue, making it sort of a love-it-or-hate-it type of deal. If you like Battlestar Galactica or other social deduction games, this may be a good option to explore.
This expansion introduces new prelude cards that offer varied starting conditions, as well as three new monstrous horrors (Shoggoth, the Drowned Spirit, and the Grasping Tendril), plus new skills, items, and boon cards.
Edrich Horror is a different, more worldly experience than the Arkham Horror board game. While Arkham Horror primarily exists in neighborhoods within the city proper (and the sea), Edrich Horror has players navigating cooperatively around the globe to complete objectives. Some have said that Eldrich Horror is like a sequel to a movie.
Some things have been changed and adjusted in Eldrich Horror that make it more accessible to beginner and mid-range gamers. It involves a far quicker setup than Arkham Horror does, which is an immediate plus for gamers who want to get things out and get playing quickly. Eldrich Horror also has simpler rules than Arkham Horror, making the ""teach"" a bit more entry-level-friendly.
That said, Eldrich Horror is more aboutstrategyand solving puzzles. Its first in the series was released in 2013.
There are eight expansions possible to play in Eldrich Horror. Those expansions are Forsaken Lore, Mountains of Madness, Strange Remnants, Under the Pyramids, Signs of Carcosa, The Dreamlands, Cities in Ruin, and Masks of Nyarlathotep.
There are a couple of other ways you can play in the Arkham universe outside of these standard board games. You can play a couple of the board games online. You can also try the franchise's first foray into the world oftabletop roleplaying games.
Arkham Horror released its first TTRPG late last year, with a starter set followed by a rulebook. I recommend trying the starter set first. Once you’ve gotten a feel for the rules and the game, you can choose to grab the rulebook to start your own journey.
The core starter set is super accessible for beginning players. It has a sample campaign to play through for folks who may be new to the TTRPG world, and does not require an experienced Game Master.
Once you've taken the starter set for a spin with your gaming group, you can pick up the Core Rulebook if you want to keep going on new TTRPG adventures in the Arkham Horror universe.
A digital version calledArkham Horror: Mother’s Embracewas released on Steam in 2021. It’s a single-player game that some might find similar to the Mansions of Madness board game expansion. Unfortunately, it only plays as a solo game. If you're open to solo treks into this universe, you can get this digital adventureon Steamoron Switchfor an MSRP of $19.99.
Solo or not, the digital version has gotten mixed reviews. IGN'sArkham Horror: Mother's Embrace reviewscored it a 5 due to lacking story execution. It fumbles with some heavy topics, which may deter some players from enjoying the Lovecraftian mythos.
There is also a digital version of Elder Sign available onSteamand mobile platforms. Elder Sign: Omens was released in 2011, but has received mostly positive reviews on Steam. It's quite affordable at only $5.99.
If you are a fan of Lovecraft mythos-themed games, as I am, Arkham Horror is absolutely worth exploring. One awesome thing is that you can play several of these games solo as well as with friends. They are each different and offer a unique presentation of the Lovecraftian worlds.
That said, these games are on the more difficult side. They have quite a bit of chance, which can drastically increase replayability as well as frustration. Setup and learning time can also take some time. You’ll find that the card games are easier to set up than the board games, even without expansions.

"Jonah Hill's Superbad Character Was So 'Reprehensible' That Sony Insisted He Not Touch a PlayStation During Video Game Scene, Seth Rogan Reveals",2025-03-13T16:34:51Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/seth-rogan-reveals-jonah-hill-was-banned-from-touching-playstation-in-superbad,"No video games for you!Superbadco-writerSeth Rogenhas revealed that Sony foundJonah Hill's character so ""reprehensible"" that reps insisted he stay away from aPlayStationduring a video game scene in the now-beloved comedy.

“On Superbad, we were told that Jonah Hill’s character, Seth, was so reprehensible to the studio that they were like, there’s a scene where they’re playing video games and [Sony] was like, ‘Jonah can’t touch a PlayStation,’ ” Rogen told Rotten Tomatoes in a South By Southwest 2025 red carpet video.
“They were like, ‘We can’t have him interact with our products, because it’s too vile a character.’ And I was like, ‘It’s based on me, that’s very insulting.’ But we accommodated them, ultimately.”
Sony Pictures co-financed the film, so they had a lot of leverage over a few top-notch comics trying to make a generational comedy. Ultimately, instead of Hill’s Seth keysmashing his controller and yelling at the TV screen when he died in-game, Michael Cera’s character Evan can be seen playingThe Getaway: Black Mondayon PS2 in that scene. But fun fact: there’s actually a bit of a gag with one of Cera’s lines here. He mentions using an M16 assault rifle in the game — but The Getaway: Black Monday, a British cop game, doesn’t even include them in the weapons arsenal. Go figure.
Rogen was at SXSW to promote his new Apple TV+ seriesThe Studio, which had its world premiere at the festival just days ago.
Superbad also starred Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Emma Stone, alongside memorable cameos from Bill Hader and Rogen himself. Rogen co-wrote the script with Evan Goldberg and Greg Mottola directed.

75 Marvel Comics That Inspired Avengers: Doomsday,2025-04-01T13:02:34Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/75-marvel-comics-avengers-doomsday-will-pull-from-cast-reveal,"One of the reasons the MCU has been so successful over the years is that this shared universe leans heavily on the comic book source material. These movies aren’t usually direct adaptations of any one comic, but they always draw on iconic storylines and runs and make that classic material accessible to a wider audience. Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars will be no exceptions. These upcoming movies are inspired by both the original 1984 crossover Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars and 2015’s Secret Wars.

More From the MCU:How Many Minutes of Screen Time Can Each Avenger Really Get in Doomsday?
But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Now that we know themain cast of Avengers: Doomsday, we’re getting a clearer picture of which Marvel Comics storylines are inspiring this epic MCU adventure. From epic crossovers likeAvengers vs. X-Mento the debut of the Illuminati to two different versions of Secret Wars, these are the 75 Marvel comics that give us a better idea of whatAvengers: DoomsdayandAvengers: Secret Warsare about.
As seen in:The Avengers Vol. 5 #35-44, New Avengers Vol. 3 #24-33 (2015)
Again, Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars are heavily inspired by the two Secret Wars comics. This much we know from Kevin Feige and the Russo Bros. themselves, who are coming back to Marvel direct the films. But while we’ll get to Secret Wars itself in a bit, it’s worth starting out by focusing on the long, dramatic buildup to the 2015 comics version. That storyline, Avengers: Time Runs Out, will probably end up informing the plot of Doomsday as much as anything else.
From the beginning, Jonathan Hickman’s Avengers and New Avengers titles deal with the concept ofIncursions, that phenomenon where two parallel versions of Earth begin to collide and threaten to annihilate both universes unless one of the Earths is destroyed. The Incursions are revealed to be a symptom of a larger disease in the Marvel multiverse, one that seems destined to end in the complete obliteration of all existence.
Time Runs Out takes place in a particularly dire period for the Marvel Universe. Incursions are occurring more and more frequently, making the fight to stop them and save Earth-616 truly an existential crisis. Unfortunately, Time Runs Out also occurs in a period when the Avengers are more divided than they’ve been since the events of 2006’s Civil War. Once again, there are basically two opposing factions in this ideological battle. One law-abiding team of Avengers serves under S.H.I.E.L.D., while another group follows the Illuminati and their more pragmatic approach to survival.
Of course, Time Runs Out is more than just an Avengers story. Members of the X-Men and Fantastic Four also play key roles. And then there’s Doctor Doom. Doom is revealed to be a pivotal player in the conflict, as he takes on a new identity as Rabum Alal and attracts a cabal of fanatical followers. Doom’s war with the extra-dimensional entities known as The Beyonders is the source of the multiverse’s impending collapse. He sees himself as the savior of existence. Others might disagree.
We’ve already seen some plot threads inspired by Time Runs Out crop up during the Multiverse Saga. Thanks to thepost-credits scene in 2022’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, we know Benedict Cumberbatch’s Stephen Strange has joined forces with Charlize Theron’s Clea to investigate the Incursion problem. And an Incursion forms the crux of the climax of 2023’s The Marvels, resulting in Teyonah Parris’ Monica Rambeau becoming stranded on Earth-10005, a world whereKelsey Grammer’s Beast and the rest of the X-Menare making their own stand against Incursions.
If Avengers: Doomsday is an adaptation of any one Marvel story, it’s definitely going to be Time Runs Out. We’re sure to see the Incursion problem reach critical mass, prompting a desperate race to stave off the end of all things. Like in the comic, we may see the Avengers split down the middle in how they deal with this threat. Though in this case, we suspect we’ll see one team rally around Anthony Mackie’s Captain America and another around Robert Downey, Jr.’s Doctor Doom. And again, we’ll see the Fantastic Four and the X-Men drawn into the fray as everyone races to save their respective world. But if Doomsday is anything like the comic, it’s all going to be for naught in the end.
As seen in:New Avengers - The Illuminati #1-5 (2006)
In the buildup to Marvel’s Civil War crossover, readers first met the Illuminati, a shadowy group that included Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Mister Fantastic, Namor, Black Bolt, and Professor X. It was revealed that this group has been quietly manipulating events in the Marvel Universe for years, always in the name of protecting Earth from threats both within and without. Marvel’s New Avengers: The Illuminati miniseries explores the group’s actions in much greater depth.
Though they eventually disbanded, the Illuminati were reformed in Hickman’s Avengers run. The slightly revamped roster included new members like Black Panther, Beast, and Hulk (who was going through an unusually intelligent phase at the time). The Illuminati are also prominent players in Time Runs Out, resorting to questionable measures to protect Earth-616 from Incursions.
We already met one version of the Illuminati in the MCU in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, a group based on Earth-838. Unfortunately for them, they didn’t survive their run-in with Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch.
But could we meet the Earth-616 version of the Illuminati in Avengers: Doomsday? It’s hard not to come to that conclusion based solely on the cast list. What happens when you get Patrick Stewart’s Professor X, Pedro Pascal’s Reed Richards, Tenoch Huerta Mejía’s Namor, and Letitia Wright’s Black Panther in the same room? We even have to wonder if Downey’s Doom could take the place of Tony Stark here. As in the comic, we may see the Illuminati stoop to any and all measures to save their universe, even if it means damning themselves in the process.
As seen in:Avengers vs. X-Men #1-12 (2012)
Normally, the Avengers and X-Men are allies in the never-ending fight to defend the Marvel Universe. But the two teams became bitter enemies in 2012’s Avengers vs. X-Men storyline.
AvX comes at the tail end of a long period where the X-Men are fighting a losing battle to protect the mutant race from extinction. When it becomes apparent that the Phoenix Force is back and making a beeline for Earth, the X-Men see it as their last, best hope to restore the mutant population. The Avengers, however, see the Phoenix Force as a clear and present threat to everyone on Earth. That’s when the two teams come to blows.
We’ve already done a deep dive into Avengers vs. X-Men andthe ways in which it could inspire Avengers: Doomsday, but the gist is that we could see a very different take in the MCU on the concept of the two teams going to war. We’re not expecting a close adaptation of the comic book crossover, as the X-Men haven’t even been properly established in the MCU yet.
Instead, we think Doomsday’s AvX conflict would involve the multiverse. It stands to reason that Grammer is reprising the same version of Beast we saw in The Marvels’ post-credits scene, and that all the other X-Men confirmed for the film are residents of that same world, which we’re assuming is Earth-10005, a.k.a. the Fox X-Men movie universe. Eventually, Earth-616 and Earth-10005 will be linked together by an Incursion, forcing the MCU’s Avengers to battle the Fox universe’s X-Men for the fate of their respective worlds.
In that sense, the Avengers vs. X-Men conflict in Doomsday will probably be less inspired by the AvX crossover than it will the first chapter of 2015’s Secret Wars comic. In Secret Wars #1, the Marvel multiverse is reduced to just two remaining universes, the classic Marvel Universe and the Ultimate Universe. The Avengers and Ultimates go to war as the final Incursion breaks out, only for both worlds to be annihilated in the end. Doomsday may very well end in a similar battle between the Avengers and X-Men. Instead of working together to save the multiverse, they’ll be too busy fighting each other. And that’s where Secret Wars comes in.
As seen in:Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #1-12 (1984), Secret Wars #1-9 (2015)
At this point, we might as well talk about Secret Wars proper and how it’s likely to influence both Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars. As we mentioned earlier, Marvel has published two separate but not entirely unconnected Secret Wars comics, the first in 1984 and the second in 2015. The Russos have confirmed that both comics are an influence on their upcoming Avengers movies, though we’re definitely sensing more of the latter Secret Wars so far.
In the original Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars, a who’s who lineup of Marvel heroes and villains are abducted by a godlike being known as The Beyonder. He whisks them away to an artificial planet called Battleworld to fight for his amusement. In the end, Doom steals The Beyonder’s power for himself, temporarily achieving the strength to match his boundless ego. Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars is also notable for introducing Spider-Man’s black costume and paving the way for Venom.
2015’s Secret Wars, meanwhile, serves as the climax of Hickman’s sprawling Avengers run. We’ve already covered how the first issue features a desperate, doomed battle between two teams of heroes as the multiverse collapses around them. But the real meat of Secret Wars is in what happens next.
Even as the multiverse itself dies, Doom and his ally Molecule Man (a key player in the original Secret Wars crossover) make their final stand against The Beyonders. Doom steals their power and becomes omnipotent. He uses his newfound power to form a new Battleworld out of the broken fragments of dozens of dead universes. Doom then crowns himself God Emperor of Battleworld, with each realm controlled by a different Baron. It’s sort of the Marvel version of Dune or Game of Thrones.
As Secret Wars unfolds, Doom fights to hold his new kingdom together while a group of refugees from Earth-616 seeks a way to restore the multiverse. Fittingly, it all comes down to a final confrontation between God Emperor Doom and his greatest rival, Reed Richards. Even as a god, Doom can’t move past his hatred for Reed and his own self-loathing.
We don’t know how much, if at all, we’re going to see the two Secret Wars storylines adapted in Doomsday, but Avengers: Secret Wars is shaping up to be a fairly close adaptation of those comics. Once again, we’re expecting to see Downey’s Doom achieve ultimate power and form Battleworld out of the ashes of the multiverse. We’ll probably see a great many realms inspired by both the comics and various Marvel movies of years past. We’ll almost certainly see a motley team of heroes band together to restore the multiverse, including both MCU mainstays and iconic movie favorites like Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine and Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man. If you’re wondering how Marvel could ever top the fanboy glee of the portals sequence from Endgame, that’s how.
As seen in:Marvel Graphic Novel #27 - Emperor Doom (1987)
While the MCU is definitely drawing a lot of inspiration from Hickman’s Avengers run and Secret Wars for its portrayal of Doctor Doom, it’s worth taking a look at a much older story that also revolves around Doom crowning himself emperor. That story is 1987’s Emperor Doom graphic novel.
Emperor Doom shows us what happens when Doom finally grows tired of ruling one measly country and sets his sights on the entire planet. After harnessing the mind-controlling powers of Purple Man, Doom brainwashes the nations of the world into accepting him as their monarch. With no one to oppose him, Doom ushers in a new era of peace and prosperity. Life under Emperor Doom is actually pretty swell, so long as you don’t mind the total lack of free will. It falls on Wonder Man to free the Avengers and mount a resistance against Emperor Doom.
Marvel is also currently exploring a similar concept in the One World Under Doom crossover, which again sees Doom crown himself Emperor of a surprisingly docile and grateful planet.
Could we see elements of Emperor Doom when it comes to Downey’s version of the iconic villain? It’s definitely possible. The Russos have made it clear that Doom is someone who sees himself as the hero of his own story. He thinks he’s doing what has to be done to save the Marvel multiverse. Maybe we’ll see him crown himself emperor in Avengers: Doomsday, rallying the entire world to his cause. We suspect a great many people in the MCU would be only too happy to pledge their life to a guy with Tony Stark’s face.
As seen in:Infamous Iron Man #1-12 (2016)
To be honest, we’re still trying to wrap our heads around the surprise reveal thatDowney has been cast as Doctor Doom. Why bring back the most recognizable MCU actor to play a completely different character? What’s the significance of the fact that Doom looks like Tony Stark? Is he a version of Tony from another universe where things worked out differently, or is he merely using Tony’s face to further his own agenda?
Those are all questions we probably won’t see answered until Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters. But it certainly can’t hurt to look at one of the comics that explores the Iron Man/Doctor Doom relationship in greater depth.
For that, we recommend looking at 2016’s Infamous Iron Man, part of Brian Michael Bendis' larger Invincible Iron Man run. This series is set after the events of 2015’s Secret Wars. No longer a God Emperor, Victor von Doom has been healed in body and soul. He’s determined to prove himself a hero worthy of the mantle of Iron Man. And because Tony Stark himself is comatose at this point, there’s no one to actually stop Doom from giving it an honest go.
Will Infamous Iron Man have a direct influence on Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars? It’s hard to say. Though, if nothing else, we wouldn’t be surprised if the MCU draws on Doom’s character design in this series as it introduces a Tony Stark-ified version of Doctor Doom. Downey’s character may look less like the traditional Doom than he does this version that wears a silver and green Iron Man armor.
But again, we know that Downey’s character is someone who sees himself as being in the right. Doom firmly believes he’s the hero. There may be elements of Infamous Iron Man that work their way into that portrayal of Doom. He’s a character who needs to win hearts and minds if he’s going to carry out his plan of saving the multiverse.
As seen in:Fantastic Four - 1 2 3 4 (2002)
With all the spectacle and cosmic stakes going on in these next two Avengers movies, it’s all the more important they find time to focus on the smaller character moments. They need to be perfectly balanced enough to satisfy even Thanos himself. Avengers: Infinity War accomplished that task by giving us moments of levity between Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Doctor Strange and zeroing in on the doomed romance between Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch and Paul Bettany’s Vision. Endgame was basically one long fat joke at the expense of Chris Hemsworth’s Thor.
How will Avengers: Doomsday lighten the mood? We suspect that’s going to fall on Namor’s brawny shoulders. Anyone who’s read a Fantastic Four comic featuring Namor will know that the King of Atlantis has the hots for Susan Storm. Heck, he makes Wolverine’s deep infatuation with Jean Grey seem normal by comparison. Sue, for her part, has never really reciprocated Namor’s love over the years, but that’s never stopped his incessant flirtation. Hey, he’s a fish king. He’s not used to being told no.
Given that Doomsday is the first MCU movie to include both Vanessa Kirby’s Sue and Tenoch Huerta Mejía’s Namor, we can only assume we’re going to see this sexual tension play out on the big screen. Expect some of the movie’s more comedic moments to come as Namor woos Sue and she rebuffs his advances. As for Pedro Pascal’s Reed? If he’s anything like the comic book version, he may be too oblivious to notice. Sue may wind up leading Namor on just to get a rise out of her single-minded science dork of a husband.
Again, there are any number of comics the movie could draw from in this area. Namor’s unrequited love for Sue goes back a long time. But if Doomsday pulls from any one FF comic, we’d guess it would be 2002’s Fantastic Four: 1 2 3 4. That book, which is unusually dark for an FF story, may be the closest Sue has ever come to actually responding to Namor’s advances. 1 2 3 4 is also a very Doom-centric story, so that makes it all the more likely the screenwriters might have consulted this hidden gem of a Marvel comic.
And there you have it. If you want to do your homework before Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters in May 2026, you know what to read. But what Marvel storylines do you most want to see adapted in these next two Avengers movies? Let us know in the comments."
