"Pokémon Go Director Says Obtrusive Ads Will 'Not Now, Not Ever' Happen After Scopely Acquisition",2025-03-19T14:29:14Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-director-says-obtrusive-ads-will-not-now-not-ever-happen-after-scopely-acquisition,"Pokémon Go, alongside Niantic's broader gaming division, was recently acquired by mobile gaming juggernaut Scopely. The $3.5 billion sale has players a little worried about what it means for the walk-around monster-catching game, and its director is trying to assuage those fears.

In anew interview with Polygon, Pokémon Go senior product director Michael Steranka discussed the sale to Scopely and what its plans are under theMonopoly Go!publisher. Steranka said he's been looking online at some of the player theories. ""What I would love to be able to get across is like, 'Hey, it’s actually great,'"" Steranka said. ""It’s going to be a good thing for the game and for the communities out there.""
Concerns over Pokémon Go's futurerun the gamut, from monetization and mechanics to influence from Saudi-based ownership. When asked about the potential for intrusive ads and playtime restrictions, Steranka said ""definitively no, that is not happening in Pokémon Go — not now, not ever.""
""Again, Scopely really recognizes how unique this game is, and they’ve told us themselves that they would be foolish to try to change the recipe of what’s made this such a huge hit and a success,"" Steranka insisted.
""So yeah, absolutely not. We will not be building into our games any type of obtrusive ads or anything like that. I just really want to reiterate Scopely as a company, the way that they operate is they give all of their teams the agency to make the decisions that’s right for their games. And that is not something that we feel would ever be right for Pokémon Go.""
Steranka went on to stress that the Go team does not sell player data to third parties, ""full stop,"" and that it only leverages location data for game operations, with any data needed stored on U.S.-based servers and following all ""incredibly strict"" regulatory best practicies as best it can.
Getting out and going outside will remain a core focus, too, even after leaving Niantic: ""And I would be remiss if through this transaction, Pokémon Go became Pokémon Stay at Home,"" Steranka said.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 Mobile Review,2025-03-27T13:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-mobile-review,"TheNvidia GeForce RTX 5090launched back in January and easily became the most powerfuldesktop graphics cardon the market. Now, a few months later, Nvidia has launched its Blackwell architecture for laptops, and while these mobileNvidia GPUsare nowhere near as powerful as their desktop counterparts, they do deliver an incredible gaming experience, especially on high-end gaming laptops with high-refresh displays.

However, just like Nvidia’s latest line of desktop graphics cards, the generational improvement in pure performance isn’t nearly as pronounced as it’s been in previous generations. That’s offset a bit in games that support features like Multi-Frame Generation, of course, but it does mean that anyone who already has a decent gaming laptop doesn’t need to sweat upgrading their setup for this new generation.
While the GPU in the Razer Blade 16 I tested is called an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, it’s a far cry from the desktop version of the GPU with the same name. Just by virtue of space and thermal constraints, the mobile version of the RTX 5090 needs to be much smaller: Instead of the 21,760 CUDA cores in the desktop version of the card, the mobile 5090 is limited to 10,496 cores across 82 Streaming Multiprocessors. That’s less than half the silicon, and places the RTX 5090 mobile closer to the desktop RTX 5080.
But it’s more than just the size of the chip – laptops are a lot more power-constrained than a desktop, too, by virtue of needing to operate on a battery or via a portable power brick. The system I tested the RTX 5090 Mobile with had the GPU limited to 160W, which is a little over aquarterof the power of its desktop counterpart. That has a huge impact on gaming performance, since a general rule of thumb is that more power = better performance.
However, compared to the previous-generation Razer Blade 16 with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, the new mobile chip has been beefed up a bit. The RTX 4090 packed 9,728 CUDA cores across 76 Streaming Multiprocessors, at the same 160W power budget. That’s about a 7.4% increase in the amount of cores, which is a minor increase, but it lines up extremely well with the performance increase you can expect from the RTX 5090.
Keep in mind, though, that with laptop graphics, it’s largely up to the laptop manufacturer how much power and cooling a GPU has access to. There may be some gaming laptops with an RTX 5090 configured to run with as little as 95W. The laptop I tested had it configured for 160W, which is above the maximum listed TGP (total graphics power) specified by Nvidia. The point is, your mileage may vary, as a 95W RTX 5090 is going to be much weaker than one running on 150W.
Each Streaming Multiprocessor is architected a bit differently than the RTX 4090 too. Just like the desktop version, the RTX 5090 Mobile is based on the new Blackwell architecture, which places special emphasis on AI computation – after all this is the same architecture powering most cutting-edge supercomputers right now. The new Tensor Cores, combined with a new AI Management Processor, or AMP, allow the GPU to do much more complex AI workloads, and is the driving force behind multi-frame generation.
Nvidia has also made an effort to improve battery life, which has never been a strong point for gaming laptops. It’s done this by improving Nvidia Optimus, a technology that dynamically switches between discrete and integrated graphics depending on what you’re doing. But Team Green has also implemented something called “Battery Boost”, which should improve gaming performance when you’re not plugged into the wall. Basically, Nvidia is using an algorithm to detect what’s going on in the game you’re playing and adjusting performance accordingly. For example, it’ll lower GPU clocks when you’re in a dialogue scene, and push more performance when you actually need it.
Just like its desktop counterpart, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 Mobile doesn’t have the strongest generational improvement over its predecessor. On average, I found that the RTX 5090 was about 8% faster than theRTX 4090. The performance gap was a bit better in workloads like 3DMark, but for the most part it doesn’t deliver much better gaming performance, at least before Frame Generation is brought into the equation.
To be clear, testing laptop graphics performance is a bit more complicated than testing a desktop graphics card, especially across generations. The Razer Blade 16 that Nvidia sent me for this architecture review is sporting an AMD Ryzen 9 AI HX 370, while the previous-gen Razer Blade 16 I used for testing the RTX 4090 has an Intel Core i9-13950HX – twoverydifferent processors. Plus, the chassis design has changed completely, and while we have a full review on the laptop coming later, the new design is much thinner and lighter, which calls into question thermal constraints.
However, throughout my testing, I didn’t notice the RTX 5090 being thermal- or power-limited in any way, even if the RTX 4090 was able to stretch a little above the 160W power limit – though not by much. So, while my initial results point to the RTX 5090 being on average 8% faster than the RTX 4090, there is enough variability here to take the numbers with a bit of a grain of salt. We’ll have a clearer picture of what this GPU can do as more laptop designs head to market over the next year or so.
In 3DMark, the new RTX 5090 Mobile was 12% faster than the RTX 4090 in Speed Way, and 16% faster in Steel Nomad. These are both DirectX 12 tests, and indicate potential performance more than anything.
When it comes to actual games, the performance differences are much less pronounced. For instance, inCall of Duty: Black Ops 6at 1600p, the RTX 5090 Mobile system got 107 fps, compared to 106 fps from the RTX 4090. That’s just a 1% improvement and totally within the margin of error.
Things look a little better inCyberpunk 2077,where the RTX 5090 Mobile manages 67 fps to the 4090’s 62 fps, making for an 8% improvement. That’s decent, and it’s important to note that this is without Frame Generation, which will further increase the 5090’s lead in frame rate.
I testedMetro Exodus: Enhanced Editionwith no upscaling, to give an idea of what to expect from pure ray tracing performance. In this game, the RTX 5090 gets 61 fps at 1600p with the Extreme Preset, compared to 56 fps from the RTX 4090, that’s a 9% improvement, lining up with the increase in CUDA cores almost exactly.
Red Dead Redemption 2is a weird case, as it puts the RTX 5090behindthe RTX 4090 at 1600p with DLSS set to Balanced. The newer GPU gets 89 fps, compared to 93 from the RTX 4090, which is about a 4% drop. However, this is likely due to the CPU not being able to keep up.
Total War: Warhammer 3 is a good way to gauge pure rasterization performance, as it eschews any ray tracing or upscaling technologies. In this game, the RTX 5090 is about 6% faster than the 4090. Though this may be another case where the CPU is holding the 5090 back.
In Assassins Creed Mirage, the GeForce RTX 5090 is able to soar with 107 fps at 1600p with everything maxed and with DLSS set to Balanced. However, that’s only 4% faster than the RTX 4090 with the same settings.
Then, in Black Myth: Wukong, a game that’s extremely GPU-heavy, the GeForce RTX 5090 gets 63 fps on average, which is only 5% faster than the 4090’s 60 fps average. This is one of the games that showed the strongest uplift for the RTX 5090 on desktop, so it's especially damning here.
Even for creators, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 for laptops isn’t a huge improvement. In Blender, the RTX 5090 Mobile is only 9% faster than the RTX 4090 in the Monster benchmark. Blender performance usually gets better over time, but it’s something to keep in mind.
The main reason the desktop version of the RTX 5090 had a large lead over its predecessor was because it had a much higher power budget – 575W vs 450W. With the RTX 5090 and RTX 4090 having the same 160W power limit, we see similar results to other RTX 5000 graphics cards. Chips like the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5080 had very modest improvements over their predecessors, which also had similar power requirements. At least when it comes to traditional gaming performance, Blackwell seems to be an architecture that is extremely dependent on power, so it shouldn’t be surprising that laptop performance doesn’t scale as well as Nvidia’s desktop cards.
The biggest difference between the RTX 5090 and its predecessor is DLSS 4, and specifically multi-frame generation, or MFG. DLSS 4 does also include improvements that are available on previous-generation GPUs, like moving AI upscaling from a convolutional neural network (CNN) to a Transformer network. This greatly improves accuracy and image quality, whether you’re using the RTX 5090 or an older RTX graphics card.
However, multi-frame generation really is the star of the show, particularly on the Razer Blade 16 with its 240Hz display.
Just like the previous version of frame generation that debuted with DLSS 3, MFG uses the Tensor Cores to generate frames between natively rendered frames. It then uses the new AI Management Processor to pace out the frames to minimize latency and other weirdness. Frame pacing is a task that has traditionally been handled by the CPU, so the AMP is especially needed to cut down on system latency when the GPU is magically creating three frames in between each rendered one.
For a high refresh display, though, this is an awesome feature. It doesn’t improve latency or anything, but it does make the gameplaylooka lot smoother, which is really all you need in single-player games like Assassins Creed Shadows. Just don’t expect it to magically improve your response times if you enable it in an online shooter likeMarvel RivalsorFragpunk.
Nvidia claims that MFG can triple frame rates, but it’s important to keep in mind that there’s a catch: you need to already have a good frame rate to get a good experience from frame generation. I wouldn’t recommend any kind of frame generation unless you’re already getting 50-60 fps without it. Below that, you’re basically asking for weird artifacts to show up as the algorithm struggles to track objects between frames.
If you do already have a good frame rate though, MFG really does boost frame rates by a huge margin, even if it does come with a slight cost to latency. For instance, in Cyberpunk 2077 with the Ray Tracing Overdrive preset and with DLSS set to balanced with no frame generation, the Razer Blade 16 managed an average of 51 fps at 1600p. That came with latency around 47ms, which isn’tgreat, but still more than playable. When I turned frame generation to 2x, that frame rate jumps all the way up to 96 fps, with the latency going up to 53ms. That’s a huge improvement to framerate, and the latency cost really isn’tthat high. The latency cost is a bit greater with MFG, as turning it up to 4x increases average latency to 59ms – though the framerate jumps to 170 fps.
It’s a similar story inStar Wars Outlaws. At 1600p with DLSS set to balanced, the RTX 5090 Mobile gets around 61 fps on average, with an average latency around 36ms. With 2x frame generation the frame rate goes up to 115 fps, with latency also increasing to 45ms. The jump up to 4x frame generation only brings the latency up to 48ms, but bumps the frame rate up to 210 fps, which is getting extremely close to the laptop’s native refresh rate of 240 Hz.
Realistically, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 is going to primarily be found in high-end gaming laptops with high resolution displays with high refresh rates. That’s exactly where multi frame generation shines, and it’s awesome to finally be able to take advantage of these super-fast laptop screens. Still, if you’re someone who is sensitive to latency or if you play competitive games, it might not be worth enabling.

If you already have a decent gaming laptop, you really shouldn’t look at the RTX 5090 twice. It doesn’t deliver much of an improvement over its last-generation counterpart, which remains excellent. However, if you’ve been waiting to upgrade to a high-end gaming laptop for a while, features like multi-frame generation and battery boost will make premium laptops powered by Nvidia’s latest even better."
"Official Disco Elysium Mobile Version Announced, ZA/UM Calls It a 'Fun, On-the-Go Alternative' Aimed at TikTok Users",2025-03-13T15:45:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/official-disco-elysium-mobile-version-announced-zaum-calls-it-a-fun-on-the-go-alternative-aimed-at-tiktok-users,"Hot on the heels ofits announcement of new game Project C4, ZA/UM has announced an official mobile version of Disco Elysium.

ZA/UM said its goal for the mobile version, exclusive to Android devices, is to bring Disco Elysium to new players “and hopefully serve existing Disco Elysium players with a fun, on-the-go alternative.” To this end, it will release the first two chapters of Disco Elysium for mobile free of charge. You can then pay once to unlock the full game, ad-free.
“We want players to make an informed decision about their potential purchase,” ZA/UM said. “Today’s ZA/UM studio is comprised of both creators and custodians of the Disco Elysium IP. We take both of those roles very seriously and we believe that is evident in the Disco Elysium mobile experience we are creating.”
Studio head Denis Havel went one step further and said Disco Elysium on mobile is about attracting the TikTok audience.
“We intend to captivate the TikTok user with quick hits of compelling story, art, and audio, ultimately creating an all new, deeply engaging form of entertainment,” Havel said.
ZA/UM’s announcement came alongside a debut trailer for Disco Elysium on mobile, as well as screenshots. The game has new, 360-degree scenes built “exclusively to place the mobile user right in the middle of Revachol.” There’s brand new audio featuring full voiceover that “serves to deliver a more immersive, even more character-rich experience.”
Here’s the official blurb:
Narrative Lead Chris Priestman said Disco Elysium’s mobile version is “what audiobooks wish they were,” and is designed to be played in short bursts.
Disco Elysium released on mobile via Google Android summer 2025.
It is of course worth noting that while the studio name is the same, many of the key people who worked on Disco Elysium are not at ZA/UM.Numerous former ZA/UM members have left the studio since Disco Elysium's release, and some of those are working on spiritual successors.

"PlayStation Logo Pops Up on Work-in-Progress Starfield Creation, Sparking PS5 Release Speculation",2025-03-17T12:22:13Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-logo-pops-up-on-work-in-progress-starfield-creation-sparking-ps5-release-speculation,"Speculation thatStarfieldwill soon be confirmed for release on PlayStation 5 ramped up over the weekend after fans spotted a PlayStation logo on Bethesda’s official Creations website.

The logo was attached to a work-in-progress ship decals Creation for Starfield, and although the Creation was removed, fans are speculating that Bethesda’s so-far PC and Xbox-only sci-fi game is soon set for PS5.
Thoughts inevitably turn to whether Bethesda plans a significant content update, possibly even a new expansion, to coincide with Starfield’s seemingly inevitable release on PS5. There’s been little to shout about when it comes to Starfield in recent months, following the launch of the poorly receivedShattered Space expansion. Bethesda parent company Microsoft is expected to hold another summer showcase this year, as it has done in recent years, and that event may be the right time and place to learn more about all things Starfield.
Bethesda itself has said it has ""exciting things"" planned for Starfield this year, amid growing discontent from players about a lack of communication and updates. In June 2024,Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supportingStarfield, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. In an interview withYouTube channel MrMattyPlays, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”
Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new intellectual property in years, and its first mainline single-player game since Microsoft bought parent company ZeniMax Media in March 2021. IGN’sStarfield reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist.”
In January,Microsoft’s gaming boss Phil Spencer refused to rule out Starfield coming out on PS5.Starfield and MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were both reported as being considered for PS5 as far back as March 2024. Indy ended up confirmed for PS5 with a spring 2025 release window, a few months after its release on PC and Xbox Series X and S. But Starfield is yet to be confirmed for PS5, although Spencer's comments certainly suggested it was on the cards.
A number of Xbox games are currently available on PS5, including Rare’s Sea of Thieves, Tango Gameworks’ Hi-Fi Rush, and Obsidian’s Grounded and Pentiment. Microsoft already publishes Minecraft games on PlayStation consoles, among many other platforms, and is set to publish Doom: The Dark Ages and Ninja Gaiden 4 on PS5 later this year. Playground’s Forza Horizon 5 is also confirmed as coming to PS5 soon. There are even reports thatMicrosoft is finally ready to release Halo on PlayStation after decades of Xbox exclusivity.
Spencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.
“We run a business,”Spencer said in August last year. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.
“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”
It’s a busy time for the 450-person Bethesda Game Studios, which currently operates five teams: Starfield; Elder Scrolls 6; Fallout 76; mobile; and external development partnerships.

PlayStation Fans Left Disappointed After Flight Simulator 2025 Store Page Labeled 'Copycat Shovelware',2025-03-20T17:09:04Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-fans-left-disappointed-after-flight-simulator-2025-store-page-labeled-copycat-shovelware,"Fans quick to celebrate the reveal of a Microsoft Flight Simulator PlayStation Store page were left let down after it was discovered that the actual product is little more than “copycat shovelware.”

Xbox and PlayStation fans gathered to discuss a potential port for the popular flight simulation game afterReddit user CreativeRaspberry314 sharedTrophy information related to a potential PS4 and PS5 version earlier today. It would be exciting – ifnot somewhat unsurprising– to see Microsoft bring more Xbox titles to PlayStation fans, butthe spotted store pageisn’t officially related to Microsoft Flight Simulator in any way, shape, or form.
“Sadly, this is just a copycat shovelware game,” oneReddit user added. “Straight up shovelware,” anotheradded. “Actually mental tbh, the picture is a straight up rip-off. If it was MSFS, it'd have the same achievements as the Xbox/Steam versions.”
Instead, the Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation is being published by a company named Grizzly Games Limited. As spotted byEurogamer, the company shares a name with Thronefall developer Grizzly Games but is also completely unrelated to that entity. While that team is responsible for other titles like Superflight and Islanders, theGrizzly Games Limited websitereveals a catalog of what appear to be mobile games featuring glossy, AI-generated materials. The art for its Flight Simulator 2025 project also appears to be generated by AI judging by some of its muddy plane parts and strange designs.
The Thronefall team, meanwhile, provided a statement to Eurogamer related to the discovery of Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation and Grizzly Games Limited. Grizzly Games says it is not associated with the company, adding that it is using “both our name and logo illegally.”
“Furthermore they seem to incorporate the absolute opposite of our values, of what we stand for and what we’re trying to give to the gaming community,” Grizzly Games continued. “Unfortunately our legal resources are limited as a two-person indie team, but honestly I'd love to see this kind of stuff being stopped, especially since it's not only happening to us but lots of indie devs that just lack the legal power.""
As of this story’s publication, the Flight Simulator 2025 page remains live on the PlayStation Store. It describes an experience that “sets a new standard in aviation simulation, combining ultra-realistic flight dynamics with breathtaking visuals.” No gameplay for the project has been revealed.
“Can shovelware just be banned from the store please? It’s packed to the brim with it and makes browsing an absolute chore,” anotherReddit user added. “I don’t remember it being this bad in prior generations.”
PlayStationtook a standagainst what many refer to as “spam” titles in 2022. At the time, it was believed the move was made to fight back against easy-to-Platinum games, or titles that exist almost solely for the purpose of increasing players’ Platinum Trophy count. However, many shovelware titles still exist on the PlayStation Store andother digital storefrontstoday.
Webrought a magnifying glass up to the issue last monthto take a closer look at how shovelware titles impact both gamers and developers. We spoke to multiple developers to learn more about not only how these games find their way onto digital storefronts but PlayStation, Nintendo, Xbox, and Valve’s vetting process.

"Gameplay of EA's New The Sims 'Concept' Appears to Leak Online, and It's Not Going Down Well With Fans",2025-04-02T10:46:41Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/gameplay-of-eas-new-the-sims-concept-appears-to-leak-online-and-its-not-going-down-well-with-fans,"A video purportedly taken from the next iteration of The Sims has popped up online, and fans have expressed their concern about what it may mean for the much-loved series.

Project Rene- the codename sometimes used interchangeably with The Sims 5, although EA maintains Project Rene is, in fact, a spin-off project - has been bubbling around for a few years now, but early access footage from a game entitled ""City Life Game With Friends"" has many players thinking that this could well be the next Sims game.
The video itselfis a full 20 minutes long and shows the player clicking through text prompts to select their outfit, hair, watch, activities, and so on. He then spawns into a sunlit Plaza de Poupon where he buys some food and mingles with the locals. He later goes to work in the outdoor café.
Characters are clearly called Sims throughout the playtest, talk in Simlish, and are adorned with The Sims' tell-tale Plumbob.
""I am terribly disappointed with Project Rene. Yes, I know, according to EA, 'this is not the final game.' Is this a joke or what?""said one unhappy playeron The Sims' subreddit on a post entitled ""I think Project Rene is a redflag (I hope not)"" that has been upvoted hundreds of times.
""EA clearly wants to kill off normal Sims games and push people toward the mobile-style experience. So in their mind, a reboot literally means this — at least that’s what I THINK.""
""This is not going to be for me, I can tell already,"" saidanother. ""It just seems so basic and I don't want to play The Sims on my phone.""
""The funny thing is, making a PC/mobile cross-compatible Sims game isn't a bad idea,""positeda fan. ""EA just believes that mobile games HAVE to be ugly for some reason. They're chasing all of the design trends of the past decade, but it means that this thing already looks dated and it's not even out yet.""
""The way The Sims was a literally [sic] satire about capitalist suburban consumption-as-happiness.... And this is where the Sims ended up. Endless consumption-as-happiness,""suggestedanother.
Project Rene — the codenamed game initially thought to be The Sims 5 until EA distanced itself from those rumors —was first teased in 2022during a Behind the Sims Summit. It's afree-to-playSims game that featuresmultiplayer inspired by Animal Crossing and Among Us. It hasn't yet been formally revealed or received a release date, but EA has been holding small,invite-only playtests for the gamesince its announcement, with the game's latest playtest presumably spawning these recent leaks.
The name Rene was chosen because it references words like ""renewal, renaissance, and rebirth"" that ""represent the developer's renewed commitment for the Sims' bright future.""
Last October, however,images of Project Rene leakedfrom a closed online test, prompting complaints about the art style, limited features, and the use of microtransactions. It was the addition of a café that drew the most skepticism, primarily due to the smiliaries to 2018's The Sims Mobile. It was then that EA said Project Rene was not The Sims 5 but would, in fact, be a different ""cosy, social game"" released under The Sims franchise.
Don't forget that The Burglar, a familiar sight for those of us who've spent time with any of the older Sims gamessnuck back into our livesas part of the latest update forThe Sims 4.

Is the Console War Finally Over?,2025-03-08T17:30:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/is-the-console-war-finally-over,"PlayStation or Xbox? It’s the long-running question of the modern video game world. At one point or another in your life, you’ve almost certainly been a part of this debate. Maybe you’ve started a Reddit thread, or made a TikTok video, or struck up a heated chat between friends about it. While therearegamers who preach the PC gospel, and Nintendo-as-god fanatics, much of the last two decades of video game history has been made as a result of Sony and Microsoft’s ongoing tete-a-tete. But is this ‘console war’ truly still being waged? The video game industry has gone through immense change in the last year, let alone over the previous two decades. Gamers’ habits, preferences, and options have all increased exponentially in part thanks to the rise of handheld gaming and younger generations’ expertise in building their own gaming machines. The battlefield is now practically unrecognisable compared to its tribal-like origins, but has a victor finally emerged from the trenches? Possibly – but the answer may surprise you.

The video game industry has rapidly evolved to become a financial juggernaut in recent years. In 2019, its worldwide revenue was $285 billion. Last year, it was $475 billion. That figure means that video games made more than the entire world wide movie and music industries in 2023, which made$308 billionand$28.6 billionrespectively. There’s no sign of this growth stopping, either. By 2029, the industry is estimated to generate nearly$700 billion. Not bad considering its humble Pong origins.
All this considered, it’s no surprise that we’ve seen an uptick in Hollywood actors flocking to be a part of a scene with such a lucrative present and future. Mads Mikkelsen, Keanu Reeves, Jon Bernthal and Willem Dafoe to name a few have all starred in games released in the past five years. Their involvement reflects the monumental shift in the perception of video games. Even industry titans like Disney are making significant in-roads into gaming, havingjust invested $1.5 billion into Epic Gamesas part of Bob Iger’s second term challenge to solidify a gaming presence for the company. A rising tide should lift all boats – unless you’re aboard the U.S.S. Microsoft, which seems to have sprung a leak.
The Xbox Series X and S consoles are intended to be an upgrade from the Xbox One in every way. But their advancements have yet to prove truly enticing; the One currently ranks above the Series X/S by almost double the sales. When you couple this fact with comments from analytics company Circana’s games industry expert, Mat Piscatella, who hassuggested that this current console generation is now past its selling peak, it paints a worrying picture for team Xbox. Things appear even worse when you look at console sales figures from 2024. According to Statista, the Xbox Series X/Ssold less than 2.5 million units across the entire year– the PlayStation 5sold the same figure in the first quarter of 2024 alone. There are also the allegations that Xbox is supposedly closing down its department which handles the manufacture and delivery of games to physical retailers, which feels ominously connected to itsevasive responseto areport that it plans to pull out of selling consoles in the EMEA region. If Xbox really has been involved in a ‘console war’, all of this points to the signal to retreat.
But Xbox isn't retreating – it has already surrendered. During the long Activision-Blizzard acquisition process, a statement from Microsoft found in the findings of fact revealed that the company doesn’t believe its Xbox division lost the console war –it thinks it never had a shot to begin with. So, what does a company built around a video game console do when its newest model is struggling to match its predecessor in sales, and its parent company openly remarks on its failure? It gets out of the console business.
It's no secret that Xbox Game Pass has become a key priority for the company.Leaked internal documentsrevealed the estimated prices Xbox expected to be asked to pay to put AAA-titles like Grand Theft Auto 5 ($12-15 million per month) and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor ($300 million) on the subscription service. Xbox taking such costs seriously demonstrates the company consolidating cloud gaming as a key direction for it moving forward. That goal is clear to see in Microsoft’s recent ‘This Is An Xbox’ advertising campaign, which suggests the company is keen to redefine how players think of Xbox – no longer a console, but an always-accessible service with some hardware to complement it instead.
It seems like this rethinking of what an Xbox is means that the brand’s official hardware won’t be limited to being a box under your TV. An Xbox handheld has been rumored to be in development for the past year or so, backed by another leaked document from the Activision-Blizzard dealings which hints at using handheld-friendly hardware for a next-gen'hybrid cloud gaming platform'. But Microsoft’s pivot in strategy has hardly been a secret. From its announcement of plans to createa mobile game storeto compete with Apple and Google, to Xbox chief Phil Spencer’s own admission that mobile gaming’s dominance in the sphere is shaping the company’s own path moving forward, the new M.O. seems simple: Xbox is the video game brand you can play whenever you want, wherever you are.
So why is Microsoft pivoting? Sure, Xbox has struggled over the past couple of generations, but doesn’t the video game console market reign supreme? You’d be surprised. In 2024, of the total 3.3 billion estimated video gamers,over 1.93 billion of them play via a mobile device. That, of course, includes your grandmother playing Candy Crush Saga and your “non-gamer” cousin who still clocks up hours of Clash of Clans. But mobile gaming is now so much more than these casual audiences – over the last decade it has quickly become the dominant pillar of the video game market among every generation, but especially Gen Z and Gen Alpha. In 2024, thetotal market valuation for the video game industrywas $184.3 billion, with mobile games comprising exactly half of that entire figure at $92.5 billion (a 2.8% increase from the previous year). Where do consoles weigh in? At just $50.3 billion, or 27%, and that’s dropped 4% since 2023. No wonder Microsoft wants to turn your phone into an Xbox.
But this isn’t a new development. By 2013, the Asian market for mobile gaming was already dwarfing that of the western world by heights of 759% in South Korea and 280% in China. You might think GTA 5 was the most profitable game of 2013, but you’d be wrong: Both Puzzle & Dragon and Candy Crush Saga outperformed Rockstar’s juggernaut by $1.5 and $1.4 billion respectively. Take a wide-angle lens to the 2010s as a whole for video games, and you’ll find that five of the highest-grossing games were mobile games – Crossfire, Monster Strike, Honor of Kings, Puzzle & Dragon, and Clash of Clans. When you look back on the decade, I highly doubt any of these titles immediately spring to mind – and yet, I’m sure most reading this have the start-up music for Clash of Clans seared into their brains.
Phones are not the only platform drawing attention away from consoles. While not as significant as mobile gaming’s explosion, it’s clear to see that player habits have shifted toward a greater appreciation for PC gaming. Since 2014, there has been a year-on-year growth of 59 million new PC players, taking us from 1.31 billion in 2014 to1.86 billion in 2024. It’s worth noting this rise is complimented by a gargantuan 200 million in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic, during which streaming became a very attractive pastime for many house-bound players. But regardless of if Twitch called to them or not, gamers have become more technologically literate, educated by their peers online on how to build a PC powerhouse, what the best GPUs are, and how to overclock your circuit-ware. As a result, the PC’s global share of the video game market in 2024 lands at $41.5 billion – so it won’t be long until the PC battleline overtakes the army of console players, right? Well, maybe not.Netzoo’s 2016 Global Games Market Value reportdefined a $2.3 billion gap between console and PC – but in 2024, that gap has increased to $9 billion. So despite the rise of more advanced GPUs, circuit-boards, and Gen Z and Alpha’s technological craftiness, it’s a market that’s on thefallrather than the rise – at least for now. If that fall continues, it's not great news for Xbox, which has made Windows PCs its second home.
But it’s not just the dominance of mobile and the uncertain future of PC that Xbox has to contend with. Wars typically have two opposing sides, so it’s about time we looked at where PlayStation fits into this console war. Luckily for Sony, things are going pretty well. In its latest quarterly earnings report, Sony revealed75 million PS5s have been sold to date– that’s a big lead ahead of the combined 29.7 million sales for the Xbox Series X/S. The gap between the two consoles is widening, too; stats suggest that for every one Xbox Series X/S bought during November 2024,five PlayStation 5 consoles were also purchased(a ratio no doubt helped by the launch of the PS5 Pro.) Sony’s Game and Network Services also saw a healthy 12.3% bump in its profits during the final months of 2024, helped specifically by healthy first-party sales including Astro Bot selling 1.5 million copies in under two months, and lifetime sales for Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut surpassing 13 million. The future looks very bright for the PS5. Ampere Analysis’ games research director, Piers Harding-Rolls,estimates that by 2029, Sony will have sold 106.9 million consoles. How do things look for the Xbox Series X/S’s future? Well, leaked Microsoft documents estimate that by 2027,it expects to have sold around 56-59 million units. While it’s not a directly comparable projection, it’s not good. In order for Microsoft to re-establish its competitive edge in the current market, it will need to close the 5:1 PlayStation-to-Xbox gap, significantly increase the number of units sold year-on-year, and also bolster the profitability of its exclusives. Projections don’t support a positive outcome for those first two requirements, and given Phil Spencer’s ‘no red lines’ mantra on Xbox titles coming to PlayStation and Switch (possibly even including the next Halo title), the argument could be made that PlayStation is already the King of Console.
But looking at the PS5 in isolation paints a different picture. 50% of all PlayStation users arecurrently still playing on older PS4sinstead of PS5s, despite the newest generation now entering the second half of its life-cycle. Why is this? Well, of the top 20 best-selling games in the U.S. in 2024, only one is truly PS5-exclusive – Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, at #19. Helldivers 2 does feature at #3 but was also playable on PC at launch. Looking beyond last year, if we disregard remasters of PS4 games, there are roughly 15 genuine PS5-exclusive games on the console as a whole. There’s little here to justify the console’s price in many people’s eyes.
If the PS5 is struggling to justify its regular $500 price tag, then it's understandable why the $700 PS5 Pro debuted to a mixed reception to say the least. The general consensus amongst tech journalists is that perhaps this upgrade came tooearlywithin the cycle, especially given the games advertised in its campaign were slightly upscaled generation-old remasters. WhenIGN polled its readers, the result was overwhelmingly clear – the PS5 Pro has little to offer for forking over that much cash. So, simply put, the PS5 simply isn’t a must-buy console – at least, not yet. This will undoubtedly change when the behemoth that is Grand Theft Auto 6 finally releases later this year, which is almost guaranteed to become the shining star of this generation and the first chance for the PS5 to show off its true power.
So, is the console war over? If you’re Microsoft, it would appear there was never any belief that there was a chance to battle Sony for supremacy. If you’re Sony, your new console has become a success but lacks the true pedigree to be claimed as a new leap forward yet, feeling more like a bunny hop than anything else. The true winner of the console war seems to be those who chose not to play it at all. Rumors of mobile gaming companies encroaching onto the traditional console gaming sphere will only ramp up in the years to come, with Tencent rumored to be in talks to buy out Ubisoft from the Guillemot brothers, having already purchased Sumo Group in 2021. Mobile gaming is becoming increasingly pivotal to the sustainability and profitability of these companies – Take-Two Interactive claim that 10% of the world’s population plays its subsidiary Zynga’s games every month. That means that it’s more than likely that your grandma playing Zynga Poker and Words with Friends 2 is funding the continued development of Grand Theft Auto 6 – not a sentence you would expect to read five years ago, but one reflective of the new state of play of the video game market. The next five years of video gaming history will be defined less and less by who has the most powerful hardware, and more about whose cloud gaming server farm can expand the quickest and strongest. The console war is over, but the mobile gaming war (and the myriad of smaller conflicts that inevitably spin out of it) has only begun.

Preorder the New 2025 Razer Blade Gaming Laptops with RTX 50-Series GPU,2025-03-28T18:20:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/preorder-razer-blade-gaming-laptop-with-rtx-50-series-gpu-1,"Razer's new 2025 lineup of gaming laptops are now up for preorder. TheRazer Blade 16andRazer Blade 18can now be ordered directly from Razer.com and will be equipped with the upcoming Intel and Ryzen processors (depending on which display size you get) as well as the anticipated RTX 5000-series mobile GPUs in three variants: RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080, and RTX 5090. Preordering will also get you some bonus accessories depending on the model.

Razer Blade laptops are well known for their impeccable build quality. The chassis is built from a single piece of aluminum and is designed to be exceptionally thin and light for a gaming laptop. In order to get away with the svelte form factor, Razer employs its own proprietary cooling design which incorporates a vacuum sealed, liquid filled, copper vapor chamber to effectively whisk away the heat. Much like Apple MacBook Pros, a lot of engineering goes into a Razer Blade laptop, which is why they command a premium price compared to other mainstream brands.
The Razer Blade 18 is an Intel-based system and the base config is equipped with the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, which is a more performance-minded chip compared to the current Core Ultra 9 185H, which focuses on efficiency. The rest of the specs include an 18"" Dual UHD+ 240Hz display (which can natively switch to FHD+ 440Hz), RTX 5070 Ti graphics, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $3,499.99. You can upgrade to either the RTX 5080 or the RTX 5090.
Preordering the Razer Blade 16 will also get you an X-Ray Razer laptop skin and a USB-C dock.
The Razer Blade 16 is a Ryzen system and the base config is equipped with an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU. The rest of the specs include a 16"" 240Hz QHD+ OLED display, RTX 5070 Ti graphics, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $2,999.99. The processor can be upgraded to a Ryzen AI 9 370HX, and the GPU can be upgraded to either the RTX 5080 or  RTX 5090.
Preordering the Razer Blade 18 will get youan X-Ray Razer laptop skin and RGB laptop stand.
Razer has listed an expected ship date ofApril 30on the product pages.
Our benchmarks are in, and it looks like the RTX 5090 is indeed the new king of mobile GPUs, although not by the leaps and bounds we were hoping for. On average, the RTX 5090 is about 5%-10% more powerful than the RTX 4090 that it replaces. However, add in DLSS 4 and the gap widens.
RTX 5090 Mobile Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas
""If you already have a decent gaming laptop, you really shouldn’t look at the RTX 5090 twice. It doesn’t deliver much of an improvement over its last-generation counterpart, which remains excellent. However, if you’ve been waiting to upgrade to a high-end gaming laptop for a while, features like multi-frame generation and battery boost will make premium laptops powered by Nvidia’s latest even better.""
Dell announced the return of the venerable Alienware Area-51 gaming laptop back in CES 2025, and starting today it is finally available to order. It comes in two size variants: the16"" model starts at $3,199.99and the18"" model starts at $3,399.99. As expected from Alienware's new flagship laptop, the Area-51 is equipped with current generation components, including the latest and greatest Intel Core Ultra 9 CPU and NVIDIA Blackwell GPU. Orders are expected to ship out starting April 30, so get your reservation in now to prevent any additional delays.

"Star Wars Hunters Announces Shut Down Just 9 Months After Launch, Steam Release Appears Scrapped",2025-03-17T13:33:39Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-announces-shut-down-just-9-months-after-launch-steam-release-appears-scrapped,"Star Wars Hunterspublisher Zynga has announced plans for the game to shut down entirely just nine months after it was released, and it appears plans to launch a PC version of Steam are scrapped.

The NaturalMotion-developed, free-to-download team-based battle arena game launched on Nintendo Switch and iOS and Android in June 2024. IGN’sStar Wars: Hunters reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Star Wars: Hunters’ lighthearted PvP fun is like a party at the Death Star: Impressive for a bit, but probably not a place you’ll want to hang around for too long.”
It seems the review was prescient, asZynga announcedthat “after careful consideration” it had decided the final content update for Star Wars: Hunters across all platforms would be released on April 15, with the game remaining playable until October 1, 2025.
“We understand this news may be disappointing and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly,” Zynga continued. “Your passion and dedication to the game and its community have meant the world to us, and we are committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process.”
Here are the logistics: on March 25, Season 5 will be extended by three weeks. Zynga will re-run events and shop bundles from the Season, and the Ranked Season will also be extended, giving players more time to hit Kyber 1 rank.
On April 15, the game’s final content update will be released for free and in-game purchases will be disabled across all platforms. New Support Hunter, Tuya, will join the game as part of the final update. Tuya will be available and playable for all users immediately at no cost, along with a slate of additional in-game content. Zynga will continue to run a final Ranked Mode leaderboard for players to compete in and run all battlefields and game modes in rotation.
And then, on October 1, online servers will officially shut down, and Star Wars: Hunters will no longer be playable beyond this point.
There’s no mention of the PC version,which was announced to launch on Steam in early access form this year, in the shutdown notice. Its Steam page now includes a notice that the game is “no longer available on the Steam store.”
Take-Two-owned Zynga is best known for mobile games FarmVille, Words with Friends, and CSR Racing, but with Star Wars: Hunters it branched out to console for the first time. Similarly, Star Wars: Hunters was meant to be the first Zynga-published game to launch on PC.
“The success of Star Wars: Hunters on mobile and Nintendo Switch devices has led to our decision to expand the game to PC,” said Yaron Leyvan, executive vice president, games, at Zynga, back in November.
“This is something our community of fans have been asking for and we are very excited to welcome even more players to Vespaara. This moment also marks a milestone for Zynga as we bring one of our games to PC for the first time.”
There are still a number of Star Wars video games in the works, including Respawn Entertainment's third Star Wars Jedi game andBit Reactor's turn-based tactics game set to be revealed at Star Wars Celebration 2025.

Does PlayStation Plus Have a Free Trial in 2025?,2025-04-05T01:02:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/does-playstation-plus-have-a-free-trial,"Originally launched as a free service to rival Xbox Live in 2010, PlayStation Plus has evolved significantly since its humble beginnings in 2010. The current iteration of PlayStation Plus is a subscription-based service for PS5 and PS4 users that is mandatory for online play, but alsofeatures additional tiers that add benefitssuch asa catalog of downloadable games,cloud streaming, and more.

While Sony used to offer free trials for new users to its online service,PlayStation Plus does not currently offer any free trials.
Although PlayStation Plus doesn't offer free trials to everyone, certain countries or regions may occasionally have access to alimited-time free trial according to Sony's website. Unfortunately, Sony doesn't reveal exactlywhothese free trials are for orwhenthey are available, so you'll need to keep your eyes peeled. PlayStation also occasionally hasfree multiplayer eventswith no PS Plus subscription required, although these are often unpredictable.
PlayStationdoeshaveoccasional deals on PlayStation Plus subscriptions, however, they are oftenonly available for new or expired members. Come on, Sony, share the love!
There really isn't adirectreplacement for PS Plus as it's required for online play on PS5 and PS4, but there are some alternatives with free (or close to free) trials that offer a catalog of games to stream, if you so desire. However, most (if not all) of these alternatives require either a different console, a PC, or a mobile device to use the service.
Other services like Ubisoft+ and EA Play feature publisher-specific catalogs of games to stream, but they don't currently offer any free trials.

Microsoft Will Soon Integrate its Copilot AI Into the Xbox App — and Eventually Into Your Xbox Games,2025-03-13T15:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-soon-integrate-its-copilot-ai-into-the-xbox-app-and-eventually-into-your-xbox-games,"As a part of Microsoft's ongoing efforts toimplement artificial intelligence into basically everything, the company is preparing to introduce its AI Copilot into your Xbox experience to give you gaming advice, help you remember where you left off last time you played, and perform other tasks.

Announced today, Copilot for gaming will be rolled out for Xbox Insiders through the Xbox mobile app sometime soon for testing. If you're not already aware, Copilot is Microsoft's existing AI chatbot (that replaced Cortana in 2023) that's already integrated into Windows. The gaming version will have a handful of features at launch. You can ask it to install games on your Xbox for you (a process you can already do now just by pushing a single button on the app), and you can also ask it about your play history (in case you forgot what you were doing last time you played), achievements, library, or for a recommendation of what to play next. You'll also be able to speak to Copilot for Gaming directly on the Xbox app while you're playing, and it will serve you answers in the same way Copilot currently does when asked questions via Windows.
Probably the biggest use-cases touted by Microsoft available at launch is Copilot as a gaming assistant. You can already ask Copilot questions about games any time on PC, such as how to beat a boss or solve a puzzle, and it will source answers via Bing from various online guides, websites, wikis, and forums. Soon, you'll also be able to ask it those same questions on the Xbox app.
""Our goal is to have Copilot for Gaming source the most accurate game knowledge — so we are working with game studios to make sure the information Copilot surfaces reflects their vision, and Copilot will refer players back to the original source of the information.""
Unshockingly, Microsoft does not intend to limit itself to just these Copilot functions. In a press briefing, Microsoft spokespeople discussed other future possibilities for Copilot in video games, including as awalkthrough assistant to explain basic game functions, remember where items where left in a game, or tell you where to find new ones, or as a helper in competitive games that could offer strategy suggestions and tips in real-time to counter opponents' moves, or explain how and why an engagement unfolded the way it did. Though it was emphasized that these were both just ideas they were toying with, the presentation made clear that Microsoft is insistant on finding ways to integrate Copilot closely with regular Xbox gameplay. And Microsoft confirmed to me that it will eventually work with not just first-party studios, but third-party studios for integration into their games as well.
With that in mind, I asked Microsoft if Copilot gaming would be opt in or opt out of use, or if users could opt out of having their data used to train it. The answer is that yes, Xbox Insiders can opt out during the preview, but the door was left open for Copilot to be mandatory in the future. Here's what a spokesperson said:
""During this preview on mobile, players will be able to decide how and when they want to interact with Copilot for Gaming, whether it has access to their conversation history, and what it does on their behalf.
""As we preview and test Copilot for Gaming with players early, we will continue to be transparent about what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices players have around sharing their personal data.""
IGN understands that Copilot is not being limited to just player-focused usage, and that Microsoft will be providing an overview on plans for developer use in asession at the Game Developers Conference on Monday next week.

"Capcom Was on Its Knees After Resident Evil 6, Now Monster Hunter Wilds Cements Its Golden Era — Here's How It Did It",2025-03-12T12:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-golden-age-the-rise-and-fall-resident-evil-monster-hunter-wilds,"With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its wayandits audience.

Capcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.
But in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.
2016 was a bad year for Capcom.
The big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.
This was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.
All of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .
Achieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.
Capcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4.
2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema.
Unfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.
“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.
This directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op.
This downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.
But it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.
This slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.
It was clear something needed to change.
By the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability.
While neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.
“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”
Those constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6.
""We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V,"" Nakayama says. ""And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title.""
All this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards.“There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.
“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”
The team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.
There was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master.
“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.”
Street Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series.
While they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.
While Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.
Around the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience.
“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”
If you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.
“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”
Itsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance.
No other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened.
Firstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.
“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”
Monster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.
This created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.
But the reality was that Monster Hunterdidhave fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.
Released in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.
“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”
It was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”
It wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world.
“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”Tsujimoto says.
One important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.
This explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.
“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”
Monster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call.
“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&D teams were divided into R&D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”
Takeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.
There were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.
“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.
The game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series.
But Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time.
“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.
The result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history.
Naturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?
Ampo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”
But despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.
Around the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.
“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.”
Itsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.
The 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. ""Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively,"" Itsuno says. ""When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”
This vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should.
Ampo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, ""So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.”
This meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.
“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”
Since 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.
Focusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat.
But what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.
Many of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever.
When asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”
Monster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”

Honor of Kings: World – The First Preview,2025-03-26T14:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/honor-of-kings-world-the-first-preview,"If you didn’t already know it, Honor of Kings is one of the most played games in the world. Taking the number one spot in the Chinese MOBA charts, the TiMi Group is taking its free-to-play characters – and world – in a new direction with Honor of Kings: World. While its scale and monetization screech in dissonance, its flashy combat, diverse roster of playable classes, and multiplayer-flexible modes do carry some promise.

During my half-hour-long hands-on with Honor of Kings: World at Tencent’s GDC booth, I took some time to toy around with a couple of World’s different classes, take on a boss inspired by Chinese folklore, and see a brief glimpse of the story.
Although it boasts many of the same characters as its mobile MOBA predecessor, Honor of Kings: World is no MOBA. Instead, it’s a class-driven action game – for PC as well as mobile, by the way – with the kind of over-the-shoulder, action-driven combat you might expect from something like Genshin Impact. But rather than locking mechanics or gameplay behind randomized drops like in MiHoYo’s game, Honor of Kings offers players different classes to choose from. And while the same overall control scheme unifies each class – a dodge, three standard abilities, and an ultimate of sorts – the roster of different classes struck me as fairly diverse, each with its own abilities and special perks.
Usually, you’ll be able to play with two separate classes, though sometimes you might need to stick with just one for story purposes. It seems like TiMi’s put a lot of effort into the dual-class system, allowing you to switch between the two during combat. The most interesting example they showed during my demo was starting a long, multiple-attack combo and switching characters once the target was launched into the air to extend a combo. It kind of reminded me of a tag system in a fighting game.
With 11 different classes in the demo I played, I’m certain there are tons of different combinations and ways to style on your opponent. But since this was my first time playing, I looked for balance above all else: I stuck with an even-keeled loadout, using a sword-wielding class for my primary role and a ranged gunner for the second. The two nicely filled in gaps left by the other during my attempt at a boss fight: I’d lay down fire using the gunner’s active reload mechanic to improve my damage and rate of fire when the boss was spitting out attacks in a frenzy, making sure to dodge the occasional flaming projectile and then rush him down with my sword, laying on the damage with a vengeance.
This swapping was easily my favorite part of the demo. I enjoyed hammering away at the boss’s stance meter, breaking his stance, and shooting the gunner’s R ability as I closed the distance, swapping to my sword class, and unleashing a devastating ultimate attack of sorts to juice every second from the boss’ temporarily weakened state.
Taking the boss down to a certain point also revealed an interesting story beat that eventually led to me playing as a completely separate character from the pre-built avatar provided for the demo. TiMi didn’t offer much information on how frequently to expect this kind of change, only that it would happen from time to time. The demo took place somewhere closer to halfway through Honor of Kings: World’s runtime, opening up my two classes’ skill trees just enough for me to have some fun with them without overcomplicating its combat.
The boss itself was a giant monkey character with various different masks, with a personality and attacking style for each. According to the developer leading my demo, this mechanic has its roots in a traditional style of Chinese theater calledBian lian. One mask might see him spitting fire in a massive area of effect on the map, while another might see him throw around a few melee attacks. I loved this melding of culture, history, and story with a gameplay mechanic.
Aside from briefly seeing another journalist in my demo in a hub area before the tutorial, I didn’t have a chance to check out any of World’s multiplayer offerings. TiMi showed a few clips of four-person squads crawling dungeons and taking on bosses before our demo, but teased something that sounded more like an MMO. That part is still a work in progress, so they didn’t share much beyond acknowledging that there would be a bigger scale multiplayer mode in the full game, so I’m curious to see what that looks like given my demo’s single-player scope.
Before the demo, one of TiMi’s developers walked me through some of World’s premise and setup, saying that Honor of Kings: World was a gift of sorts to the MOBA’s loyal fanbase that’s propelled it to massive success in the ten years since its launch. True as that may be, I left the demo concerned about monetization.
When another journalist asked about how TiMi plans to make money with Honor of Kings: World, the developer leading our session gave a concerning answer. “The game’s gonna be based around social, so outfits and stuff,” they said.
On its own, funding a free-to-play game with cosmetics isn’t necessarily a problem – especially since the developers made it clear that there wouldn’t be any pay-to-win – but given Honor of Kings: World’s scale, with flashy cutscenes, tons of playable characters, and epic boss fights, I can’t help but feel concerned about whether or not World’s model is financially sustainable, regardless of whether or not it’s based on one of the most successful games of the century.
Honor of Kings: World undoubtedly has a bright future ahead of it, provided TiMi can stick to its promise of giving fans of its MOBA hit a celebration worthy of its success. Even though I’m still a little worried about the amount of microtransactions that Honor of Kings: World could potentially need to fund its high production value, I still had a ton of fun dodging the big primate’s swings."

Silent Hill f Has Been Refused Classification in Australia,2025-03-24T00:48:13Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-has-been-refused-classification-in-australia,"UPDATE:There is added confusion over Silent Hill f's classification in Australia. The rating reported below has been removed, and the Australian Classification Board has confirmed it has not actually been rated at this point.

ORIGINAL STORY:Konami’s upcoming Silent Hill f has been refused classification in Australia, meaning the game would not be able to be sold within Australia at this time. However, Silent Hill f’s RC rating has been assigned by an automated rating tool and not via actual Australian Classification Board members so, based on precedent, it’s unlikely this is the end of the story.
Konami does not distribute its own games locally in Australia, but IGN has contacted its third-party distribution partner for comment.
The specific reason for Silent Hill f’s RC rating has not been supplied at this time. Since the introduction of an adults-only category for games in Australia (R18+) in January 2013, games that have been refused classification in Australia are only typically flagged for sexual activity with a person who appears to be a child under 18, visual depictions of sexual violence, or tying incentives and rewards to drug use. 2008’s Silent Hill: Homecoming was initially refused classification in Australia in the lead up to its release due to a high impact torture scene but that was several years prior to the introduction of the R18+ rating, which now accommodates high impact levels of violence. Silent Hill: Homecoming was later released in Australia with altered camera angles for the problem scene, rated MA15+.
What we already know, however, is that Silent Hill f’s RC rating in Australia has actually been assigned by an online tool maintained by the International Age Rating Coalition – which is a classification system designed for mobile and digitally delivered games. The IARC classification tool is an online questionnaire where applicants simply answer a series of questions about a game’s content. The IARC tool will subsequently assign an automated rating from each territory based on the classification standards from each participating country. In Australia's case, the IARC tool then sends the decision to be published automatically onAustralia’s National Classification Database.
In Australia, the tool can only be used for digitally-distributed games (it wasadopted in 2014due to the fact that, while the Australian Classification Board was rating an average of 755 games per year, over 40,000 games were being released annually on the iOS app store alone at that time). There have beena number of instances where automated IARC ratings have demonstrated a tendency to trend higher than human ratingsfrom the Classification Board. For example, in 2019 Kingdom Come: Deliverance and We Happy Few were widely reported to have suddenly been banned in Australia when they had not.
The IARC tool is free to use, which particularly benefits small publishers and developers. Importantly, all physical releases are still required to be rated by the Classification Board itself so, if Silent Hill f is planning to have a physical release in Australia, a submission to the Classification Board was always going to be mandatory, anyhow. The Classification Board itself can override any classification given by the IARC tool if it disagrees with it.
In Australia, game publishers can either have staff members who are accredited classifiers or authorised assessors. Accredited classifiers are in-house staff who complete training from the Classification Board and can classify games themselves, and their decision will take effect as an official Classification Board decision. Authorised assessors are staff or contractors who have similar training, but their classification decision is limited to a recommendation made to the Australian Classification Board, which must then decide whether to apply it or not.
For now, it’s too early to say whether Silent Hill f’s RC rating in Australia will be upheld after further actions or not. It is, however, the first Silent Hill game to getan 18+ rating certification in Japan.

Blizzard Reportedly Receiving New StarCraft Game Pitches From Well-Known Korean Developers,2025-03-31T11:58:13Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-receiving-new-starcraft-game-pitches-from-well-known-korean-developers,"Blizzard is reportedly receiving a number of pitches for new StarCraft video games from Korean studios.

In an article brought to the internet’s attention by X / Twitter account@KoreaXboxnews,Asia Todaylisted four Korean companies who are reportedly competing with each other to develop new games based on the StarCraft IP and secure publishing rights: NCSoft, Nexon, Netmarble, and Krafton. Apparently some of these companies have traveled to Blizzard’s headquarters in Irvine, California, to make their pitches.
NCSoft, which is behind the Lineage and Guild Wars MMOs, is said to have pitched a StarCraft RPG of some kind (an MMORPG?). Nexon, maker of The First Descendant, has pitched a “unique” use of the StarCraft IP. Netmarble (Solo Leveling: Arise, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad) is hoping to make a StarCraft mobile game. And Krafton, the company behind battle royale PUBG and The Sims competitor inZOI, wants to make a StarCraft game “based on its own development capabilities.”
Of course, video game companies pitch other video game companies all the time when it comes to securing publishing rights and development contracts. And it may be the case that nothing mentioned here goes anywhere. But StarCraft fans will certainly take note of Blizzard’s reported interest in doing… something to expand the much-loved sci-fi universe, given how long it’s been since the last game in the franchise came out. Activision Blizzard declined to comment when contacted by IGN.
It’s worth remembering that in September, it emerged thatBlizzard was making a third attempt at developing a StarCraft shooter, with former Far Cry executive producer Dan Hay, who joined Blizzard in 2022, leading the charge.
The news came from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier while speaking to IGN’s Podcast Unlocked, below, about his recent book, Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment. Hay’s StarCraft shooter is mentioned in the book, and IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey asked Schreier if it’s likely to actually come out.
“If it’s not canceled!” Schreier replied. “This is Blizzard after all. Their history with StarCraft shooters is not good.
“Yes, that is a project that as far as I know is in development, or at least as of the time that I wrote this book was in development. They are working on a StarCraft shooter, StarCraft is not dead at Blizzard.
“The goal of the book isn’t to get a bunch of scoops about upcoming things. That wasn’t the purpose of this book at all, it was very much to tell a story and focus on stuff that had happened. But this felt like such an interesting and useful nugget to include because it really just shows you that Blizzard cannot quit StarCraft shooters.”
That was a reference to Blizzard’s infamous attempt to release a StarCraft shooter in the past as part of a bid to expand the StarCraft franchise beyond its real-time strategy origins.StarCraft Ghost, announced in 2002, was going to be a tactical-action console game in which you played as a deadly Ghost operative in the employ of the Dominion, but it was canceled in 2006 after a series of delays.
A second attempt to make a StarCraft shooter, codenamed Ares, was canceled in 2019 so Blizzard could focus onDiablo 4andOverwatch 2. Ares was reportedly “like Battlefield in the StarCraft universe,” but, like Ghost, fell by the wayside.
More recently, in November,Blizzard was spotted hiring for an “upcoming open-world shooter game,”with all signs pointing to it being a StarCraft FPS.
Things are slowly ramping up for StarCraft. Blizzard recently releasedStarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection on Game Pass, and announced a StarCraft crossover with Warcraft card game Hearthstone.

825 Forest Road Review,2025-04-05T13:09:52Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/825-forest-road-review-shudder,"825 Forest Road is now streaming on Shudder.

Writer and director Stephen Cognetti is ready to be known as more than the “Hell House LLC Guy.” Unfortunately, his latest movie won’t help him accomplish that goal. 825 Forest Road ditches the found-footage Halloween scares of Cognetti’s directorial debut and its sequels for a more traditional approach to horror. Unfortunately, it's nowhere near as engaging or inventive as those four (and counting) trips to the cursed Abaddon Hotel. 825 Forest Road is a tangle of feeble lore, jumbled storytelling jumps, and an upsetting mannequin who’s scary, but can’t quite escape the shadow of the terrifyingly mobile clown dummies that stalk the Hell House movies.
The ingredients of his past success are all in place: 825 Forest Road brings a malevolent force and unsuspecting victims to the central location of the title. Chuck Wilson (Joe Falcone), his seamstress wife Maria (Elizabeth Vermilyea), and his artistic younger sister Isabelle (Kathryn Miller) leave tragedy behind to make a fresh start in the small town of Ashland Falls. But Ashland's darkest supernatural secret eventrually comes a-knocking at Chuck's front door: Her name is Helen Foster (Diomira Keane), and untimely deaths are her calling card. Cue the stock possession-horror thrills as the trio’s spacious yet surprisingly affordable home is infested by a vengeful spirit that Helen eventually channels into Maria's disturbing antique mannequin, ""Martha.""
There’s no visual imagination to be found in 825 Forest Road. Ashland Falls is portrayed like any other humble American community, no different from the settings of the 50 other scrappy little haunted-house movies you’ll see this year. The character Cognetti brought to Hell House LLC's monstrous attraction doesn’t extend to 825 Forest Road, either – with its architectural stuffiness and generic production design, the house might as well be an unoccupied model in the middle of a new housing development. And without the found-footage hook, the filmmaking lacks pop, sucking the life out of Chuck's residential nightmare.
Cognetti also miscalculates the durability of his storytelling, splitting 825 Forest Road into three repetitive chapters focused on a different member of the family. We follow Chuck, Irene, and Maria as they interact with Helen throughout the same sorta-spooky events, but the momentum is choppy at best – nothing revealed along the way is thunderous enough to be rewound multiple times. Cognetti struggles to bring his concept to life, whether it's Helen's underbaked backstory or the counterintuitive motivations that peg Chuck's crew as mindless cannon fodder. A few valiant efforts are made to prop up the exposition – like introducing the town's underground paranormal discussion group – but if the devil's in the details, he's on vacation.
I'll admit: Martha the mannequin – with her crackly,  papier-mâché complexion and habit of turning up where you least expect her – makes an effective antagonist. As Helen taunts the befuddled residents of 825 Forest Road by puppeting Martha around the house, Cognetti calls back to his nerve-shredding usage of Hell House LLC's bald-and-painted clown prop. The ghastly figure makes a good jump scare (when she’s not a shoddy digital effect), but 825 Forest Road is never scarier than when Martha gains mobility, scampering about like one of Donna Beneviento'sResident Evil Villageminions. So much of 825 Forest Road is a struggle, but not when Cognetti reminds us why Hell House LLC garnered a ravenous following addicted to blood-pumping terrors. If only the Martha material had a more powerful, lingering effect.
The rest of 825 Forest Road stumbles through the motions. The performances are a serviceable crop, but the cast doesn’t give you anything that'll stay seared in your memory. Cognetti recycles a few tricks from his Hell House LLC experiences, but they're less impactful without the intimacy found-footage can provide. Then there's the death blow of the final act, an anticlimax that fades to black at the worst possible moment. The kernel of an idea in 825 Forest Road never puffs into something tastier – it’s the hardened shell at the bottom of Cognetti’s bowl of savory found-footage frights. Perhaps the upcoming Hell House LLC: Lineage will prove a better method of closing the door on this chapter of his career.
825 Forest Road is an unimposing ghost story that resembles a first draft begging for revisions. Hell House LLC director Stephen Cognetti is able to string a few solid scares together here, but overall, his first feature-length excursion beyond the grounds of the Abaddon Hotel is a forgettable bore. There's nothing vital or remarkable about this run-of-the-mill haunted-house movie – its spirit-conjuring villain, Helen Foster, deserves better, frankly. You'll get your kicks from a manic mannequin come to life, but those moments have all the fleeting adrenaline rush of a pinprick."
A Minecraft Movie Review,2025-04-02T19:00:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-review-jack-black-jason-momoa,"A Minecraft Movie immediately creates a sticky paradox for itself. Clearly hoping to follow in the footsteps of a project likeThe Lego Movie, this video-game adaptation wants to pay tribute to the open-world flexibility and creativity ofMinecraftwhile staying well within the framework of the game itself, which means including all of the expected blocky visual touchstones and including an obligatory number of cutesy gamer in-jokes. The surprise of the movie is how long it’s able to delay the latter material – long enough, it turns out, forNapoleon Dynamitedirector Jared Hess to get his foot in the door, expertly adapting his deadpan comic-strip style for a children’s fantasy.

Hess’ foray into big-time franchise filmmaking reunites him with Jack Black, the star of his 2006 slapstick adventure,Nacho Libre– and no one can accuse Black of half-assing his way through a paycheck job here. As Steve, a man who “yearned for the mines” as a child and discovers a portal into the magical Overworld as an adult, he throws off the shackles of workaday existence with such relish that his torrent of movie-opening narration feels enthusiastic, rather than blandly explanatory. The short of it: Bad-guy pigs covet the “orb” (like everything else in the Overworld, it’s block-shaped, not an actual orb) that Steve has discovered, so he sends his faithfulwolf-dog, Dennis, to hide it in the real world.
Hess really connects with his Dynamite roots – throwback fashions, drier-than-dry non sequitur – and setting in that real world, where he pauses Steve’s story to follow siblings Natalie (Emma Myers, fromWednesday) and Henry (Sebastian Hansen) as they relocate to a small town in Idaho. There, creative, school-age misfit Henry clicks with Garrett Garrison (Jason Momoa), a former gaming champion who now runs a retro pop-culture junk store on the verge of foreclosure. Natalie, meanwhile, meets Dawn (Danielle Brooks), a friendly real estate agent who moonlights as a kind of mobile zookeeper.
In a movie for grown-ups, this litany of quirk might seem a bit much: Natalie is a young woman of indeterminate age who gets a job running social media for a local potato-chip factory; Henry tinkers with his design for a working jetpack. For a kid picture, though, it’s sweetly silly, even distinctive; the kitschy tater-tots-and-alpacas ambience is pure Hess. Momoa in particular makes a surprisingly good fit for the filmmaker’s sensibility, playing a less bullying version of the blustery Napoleon Dynamite sensei Rex Kwon Do. In fact, the first 30 to 40 minutes of A Minecraft Movie have enough big laughs that it’s almost a disappointment when Henry, Garrett, Natalie, and Dawn stumble upon the orb and wind up accidentally sucked into the Overworld.
Eventually they meet up with Steve, who provides some standard gameplay tutelage in advance of their quest. The quest itself is conceptually muddy, confusingly and erratically presented as some combination of saving Steve’s beloved Dennis, protecting the orb, and eventually bringing the four displaced travelers home. The seams of the six-writer screenplay show frequently, like when characters make plans and then deviate from them without comment as if the actors are all working from different versions of the script. Based on the uninspired action sequences – digital hordes running and flying around in a manner better suited for an in-gameLord of the Ringsfan film – there aren't many big-budget fantasy epics in Hess' future. But A Minecraft Movie stays light on its feet nonetheless by continually pausing for slapstick silliness and cartoonish little sketches like an ongoing and delightfully pointless subplot involving Jennifer Coolidge and a resident of the Overworld.
Eventually, the more antic side of things takes over, and the various CG landscapes populated by blocky people and creatures start to feel repetitive. It’s like a slightly more polished version of someone’s playthrough video, only with a couple of big stars getting thrown around the screen. What A Minecraft Movie misses from Minecraft the game is its combination of minutiae and vastness; as much as the movie advertises its subject’s creative flexibility, it shortchanges any potential obsessiveness in favor of making the Overworld look a little more like something out of aMariogame. The parallelsto Black’s other video-game-movie gig– and aspirations to its popularity with the playground set – become especially clear when Steve chases the next “Peaches” by riffing out no fewer than three little songs. (On the other hand, it’s hard to resist Black bringing his goofball-rock-star shtick to Gen Alpha.) As with so many game-based movies, the mismatch between what each medium does best isn’t really reconciled by A Minecraft Movie. But turning the world’s best-selling video game into Jared Hess’s best feature in years is, admittedly, a pretty creative undertaking.
For a big-studio adaptation of a massively popular video-game, A Minecraft Movie lets a surprising amount of its director’s personality shine through. Napoleon Dynamite’s Jared Hess manages to fit some laugh-out-loud silliness into his Overworld saga before surrendering to the obligations of CG-driven fantasy adventure. Thematically, A Minecraft Movie offers a pat world-is-what-you-make-it lesson, but Jack Black and Jason Momoa in particular sell it with a lot of comic enthusiasm."
Microsoft Reveals Xbox Game Pass April 2025 Wave 1 Lineup,2025-04-02T18:53:17Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-reveals-xbox-game-pass-april-2025-wave-1-lineup,"Microsoft has unveiled a list of Xbox Game Pass titles set to join the service in the first half of April 2025, revealing a strong lineup of first- and third-party games, including South of Midnight, Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition, Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls – Ultimate Evil Edition, and more.

It’s a remarkably strong month that was detailed in a recentXbox Wirepost. Expect major hitters to start dropping in tomorrow, April 3, kicking off the month with Gearbox Software’s Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition (Cloud, Console, and PC) for all tiers, while All You Need Is Help (Console), Still Wakes the Deep (Xbox Series X | S), and Wargroove 2 (Console) all join Game Pass Standard. There’s more than enough in this first block to keep even the most dedicated Xbox fan busy all month, but you’ll only have five days before South of Midnight (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) and Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls – Ultimate Evil Edition (Console and PC) arrive for all Game Pass subscribers April 8.
South of Midnight, Compulsion Games’ Deep South-set folklore adventure, is poised to be one of Xbox’s biggest releases of the year, and its presence on Game Pass will no doubt have hordes of players seeing what it has to offer. Microsoft’s official description sheds more light on how it will bring some life to Game Pass this month: “Explore the mythos and confront mysterious creatures of the Deep South in this modern folktale while learning to weave an ancient power to surmount obstacles and face the pain haunting your hometown.”
April 9 follows with Commandos: Origins (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, with Blue Prince (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) coming to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass tiers April 10. Finally, Hunt: Showdown 1896 (PC) will round out the Wave 1 drops come April 15 when it is added for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers.
Xbox Game Pass perks are also getting a refresh for the first half of April 2025. Highlights include the Beyond the Void Bundle for The First Descendant, the Sweet Starter Pack for Candy Crush Solitaire players on mobile devices, and an anniversary Seventh Serving Emote for Sea of Thieves fans. You can see the full list of everything coming to Game Pass in the first half of April below.
Another month of Game Pass newcomers means another batch of games will soon be leaving, too. You’ll be losing access to these titles come April 15, so if you’re interested in playing but don’t think you’ll have time to reach the credits, Microsoft still offers a 20% discount for members looking to pick up a last-minute purchase.

The PS Portal, Sony's handheld gaming accessory for the PS5 console, looks very much like an extended split-pad DualSense controller with an 8-inch 1080p LCD screen in the middle of it. It turns your PS5 into a gaming handheld by letting you stream games from your console at up to 60fps. The controller mirrors the same features found on the DualSense, including haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and a touchscreen interface that replaces the Dualsense's touchpad. The Portal can stream your games even when you're outside of your home, with the caveat that you have access tovery stable, very fastinternet connection. Keep in mind that the PS Portal is not a standalone device. This is strictly a remote player for the PlayStation 5, so you will need a PS5 to use it.

Now, rather than being limited to simply streaming games from a $500 console to a $200 handheld, Sony has introduced a feature that lets owners stream games directly from its PlayStation Now cloud streaming service. No PS5 required. Portal owners now have the option to either connect the Portal to their PS5 as before, or directly to Sony’s cloud servers. Choose the latter and suddenly you have access to a library of more than 120 games, including Ghost of Tsushima, Resident Evil 3 Remake, The Last of Us Part 1 Remastered, and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.It’s worth noting you must be a subscriber to the highest tier of PlayStation Plus, but $18 a month is much more attractive that splashing out $500 upfront plus an extra $70 a game.
It should be said that the PlayStation Portal isn’t the only way to stream your PS5 games over Wi-Fi within your home. You can mimic its functionality by downloading the PS Remote Play app on a mobile device, including other gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck.  That said, it's more complicated to set up and you'll lose out on some of the Dualsense's features.
PlayStation Portal Reviewby Seth Macy
""The PlayStation Portal is the most surprising device I've ever come away from loving after going in loaded with skepticism. It's such a better experience than using your phone with a slap-on controller, and it works so much better than I was anticipating. I really love the freedom it gives me to play my PS5 from anywhere with decent WiFi coverage, especially when the rest of my family was using the TV to (somewhat ironically) play the Switch. Bearing in mind that it’s in no way a stand-alone device and 100% requires a PlayStation 5 to function at all, the biggest things keeping the Portal from being a truly amazing device are its current lack of a way to access WiFi that requires a web browser to log in, and its lack of Bluetooth support for audio. For now, it's a great device that represents the best current solution for PlayStation Remote Play, and if it weren't for those two baffling caveats, I'd call this a must-own device for every PS5 owner who enjoys playing games on handheld – or has to compete for the household TV.""

Madame Web Star Sydney Sweeney Reportedly in Final Talks to Star in Live-Action Gundam Movie,2025-04-01T11:17:48Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/madame-web-star-sydney-sweeney-reportedly-in-final-talks-to-star-in-live-action-gundam-movie,"Madame Web star Sydney Sweeney is reportedly in final talks to star in the live-action Gundam movie.

In February, it was confirmed thatthe live action film adaptation of the beloved anime and toy franchise Mobile Suit Gundam had entered production, with Bandai Namco and Legendary signing an agreement to co-finance it.
The companies confirmed Mobile Suit Gundam, which currently lacks an official name, will be written and directed by Sweet Tooth showrunner Kim Mickle and released in theaters globally. No release window or plot details were shared, though a teaser poster, below, was released.
Varietyreported on Sweeney’s Gundam involvement in the live-action Gundam movie, although plot and character details are unknown at this time.
Sweeney is known for HBO drama series Euphoria, The White Lotus, Reality, Anyone but You, and the aforementioned superhero flop Madame Web. Last month,Sweeney was attached to appear in and produce a movie version of a horror story posted on a Reddit thread.
""We plan to steadily announce details as they become finalized,"" Legendary and Bandai Namco said at the time the live-action film was released.
""Mobile Suit Gundam, which began broadcasting in 1979, established the genre of 'real robot anime' that could not be described in terms of simple good and evil, which had been the trend of robot anime up to that point, with realistic depictions of war, detailed scientific examinations, and intricately interwoven human dramas that treated robots as 'weapons' called 'mobile suits,' and caused a huge boom,"" they added.

Astro Bot Reviewby Simon Cardy
""Astro Bot made me smile from beginning to end. A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive.

Pokémon Go Dev Moves to Reassure Players After $3.5 Billion Sale to Monopoly Go! Company Is Confirmed,2025-03-12T12:45:38Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-dev-moves-to-reassure-players-after-35-billion-sale-to-monopoly-go-company-is-confirmed,"Niantic Inc. has confirmed the sale of Pokémon Go, Pikmin Bloom, Monster Hunter Now, and their development teams to the Saudi-owned maker of Monopoly Go! for $3.5 billion.

An additional $350 million of cash from Niantic is being distributed as part of the deal, yielding a total value of approximately $3.85 billion for Niantic equity holders.
Ina note to press, Scopely, which is owned by Saudi investment company Savvy Games, said the Niantic games business has over 30 million monthly active players (MAUs), over 20 million weekly active players, and saw more than $1 billion in revenue in 2024. Pokémon Go is the jewel in the crown, ranking as a top 10 mobile game every year since its launch nearly a decade ago, with over 100 million unique players in 2024.
Niantic said its game team has “exciting long-term roadmaps that they will continue to build upon as part of Scopely.”
“This partnership ensures that our games have the long term support needed to be ‘forever games’ that will endure for future generations,” Niantic said in a blog post.
“Players can expect that the games, apps, services, and events they know and love will continue to receive Scopely’s ongoing investment, driven by the same teams that have always created these experiences.”
Ina separate blog post, Pokémon Go chief Ed Wu moved to reassure playerswho had already expressed concern about the fate of the gameif a sale were to go through.
“As it’s always important to me, and our entire game team, that our community understands and is excited by the long-term vision for this game, I want to share why I believe a partnership with Scopely will be a positive step for all of you and the game’s future,” Wu, who was the original engineer on the Pokémon Go codebase and was there for its massive 2016 launch, said.
“Scopely expressed a deep admiration for this community and our team. I have every belief Pokémon Go will further flourish as part of Scopely, not only into its second decade, but for many more years to come, under the mission of discovering Pokémon in the real world and inspiring people to explore together,” Wu continued.
“Our new partnership, along with our decade long partnership with The Pokémon Company, means we can maintain this long-term focus. Scopely fully believes in our mission and ongoing goal to create the best Pokémon Go experience possible. Their focus will be to support our team, providing resources to continue delivering the gameplay you all know and love.
“The entire Pokémon Go team is staying together through this partnership. The same people who have been guiding and building the game for years will continue doing what we love. We’re always continually adding to the game - Raid Battles, friends, Go Battle League, Routes, Dynamax/Gigantamax, and, of course, Pokémon Go Fest and our live events - which I look forward to continuing to do for many years to come. Scopely empowers their game teams as autonomous groups to go after the roadmaps that they’re inspired to pursue, and what each team believes is best for the player experience. This approach is extremely appealing to us at Niantic games. I have spoken to a number of game leaders at Scopely who have given me great confidence in how the company enables each game to independently develop and creatively thrive.
“We will be joining a broader organization dedicated to games. I believe that Pokémon Go can continue to thrive with Scopely’s exclusive and long-term focus on game-making. Scopely’s status as a private company also means we can prioritize what’s best for you, our Trainers, for the long term. We believe that prioritizing short-term gains at the expense of our long-term mission would be counterproductive and self-defeating. Every interaction I’ve had with Scopely leaders has reinforced that we are in total agreement that the scale, longevity and most of all, real world community, of Pokémon Go make it truly special. We are united in protecting that.
“With Scopely’s full commitment, experience and resources, we’re going to make Pokémon Go the very best it can be – with incredible battles for thousands of Trainers at a time at our live events and new ways to connect to your friends and community, all while remaining focused on the excitement and experience of discovering Pokémon in the real world. We have invested to empower thousands of Community Leaders and Ambassadors who lead millions of Trainers to play together in the real world, and Scopely is in full agreement that this highly-admired program will be a priority to invest in together. The real-world community that loves Pokémon Go will remain our guiding light in all we do.
“Our partners at The Pokémon Company have always been central to how we build this game together, starting with the physics of the first Poké Ball throw that we hand-tuned together. I am incredibly grateful for their daily wisdom, guidance, and careful stewardship of our shared vision for discovering Pokémon in the real world, and I’m very excited that our partnership with The Pokémon Company will continue as it has for the last decade.
“I won’t say that Pokémon Go will remain the same, because it has always been a work in progress. But how we create and evolve it will remain unchanged, and I hope that we can make the experience even better for all of you.
“I have so much gratitude for the incredible joy of serving hundreds of millions of Trainers in our real-world community for the past nine years, and I truly believe the best is yet to come.”
Elsewhere, Niantic said it’s spinning offits controversial geospatial AI businessinto a new company, Niantic Spatial Inc., “enabling it to accelerate and scale even more rapidly.” Scopely is a $50 million investor in this new venture, which also has $200 million from Niantic itself.
Niantic Spatial will continue to own and operate its other real-world AR games, Ingress Prime and Peridot.

The NYXI Hyperion 2 Might Be the Best Switch Joy-Con Alternative,2025-03-07T22:23:33Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nyxi-hyperion-2-nintendo-switch-joypad-review,"With the Nintendo Switch 2 on the horizon and presumably launching sometime in the Summer,  perhaps it’s a little too late for even one ofthe best Switch controllersandJoy-Con alternativesto hit the market. But I suppose it’s better late than never. The NYXI Hyperion 2 is a vast improvement over the original Switch's stock Joy-Con with smooth Hall Effect analog sticks, clicky buttons, and ergonomic grips. And since the Hyperion 2 can be used while detached from the Switch, it’s even good enough to recommend in place of a Pro controller (although it does not come with a snap-grip). So, if you’re looking to stay with the original Switch for the foreseeable future and are still looking for a Joy-Con upgrade to improve the handheld experience, this is what you want.

Coming for the first Hyperion, the Hyperion 2 sports a much more sensible design – while it’s a bit wider than the normal Joy-Con, it doesn’t have a weird grip style that juts out horizontally. The Hyperion 2 retains a symmetrical shape and looks like it belongs on a Switch. A major perk is the ergonomic grip that fills my hands akin to a Steam Deck, riding the line between being substantial and not being too bulky. There’s a textured surface on each handle that also helps your grip stay secure. This feels like a proper controller to hold and remains relatively lightweight at just 80g each (normal Joy-Cons weigh in around 50g each).
The buttons might take a moment to get used to since they work quite differently from the standard Joy-Con. Both the directional pad and face buttons have a clicky mouse-like actuation. What you get in return is a softer and more responsive button-press that’s lighter on the thumbs – they’re also bigger to make them even easier to use. My only gripe is that they have a little too much wiggle room since they’re not tightly locked in place and don’t feel as stable as they should be.
That mouse-click design extends to the shoulder bumpers (L and R) and triggers (ZL and ZR). Since the Switch doesn’t have analog triggers, the Hyperion 2 is able to have hair triggers without losing functionality. They sport a very short travel distance and are quick to hit while being light to the touch. The bumpers are easy to hit as well and all it takes is a tap to actuation, and it’s responsive enough to press on the side of the bumper as well.
The biggest improvement, however, is in the analog sticks. Not only does the magnetic Hall Effect design solve the issue of stick drift (which has plagued many Switch owners), these are full-fledged analog sticks that rival that of other consoles. You get a full range of motion and a consistent resistance throughout that range – while it’s just a tad stiff to get off the deadzone, they remain smooth to the touch for precise movements.
Most aftermarket controllers nowadays have back buttons, including the Hyperion 2 – you get two programmable buttons (one on each grip) that sits along your middle finger. NYXI struck a good balance between being easy enough to press without too much effort and not being so light that you'd accidentally hit them (unless you’re gripping your Switch like your life depends on it.) However, a knock against them here is that you need to download a mobile app called KeyLinker to program opposite-side inputs to a back button. It’s a woefully unintuitive app that also requires you to unlink the controls from the Switch in order to connect to the app. Every aftermarket controller I’ve used in the past has the ability to program its extra buttons on the fly, and perhaps this particular aspect is a limitation of the Joy-Con design being split, but it’s baffling that NYXI doesn’t make this easier.
The RGB lighting along the ends of the face buttons and d-pad, and around each analog stick, is a nice aesthetic touch. A tiny lighting button on the back of the grips lets you cycle through four different settings: off, rainbow effect, solid color, and breathing solid color. For both solid color settings, you can choose seven different colors by holding the lighting button and using the analog stick to cycle through them. Both grips can have their RGB set independently so you can have your own color combo.
You still get rumble functionality (although not HD rumble) and gyroscope motion controls when using the Hyperion 2 wirelessly. The last standout feature, however, is the Turbo setting. There are rare cases in which it’ll be beneficial, but thankfully it’s very easy to set for the moments it’s useful. Simply hold the Turbo button, press the button you want to set, and let go – doing this once will set the button to repeat while holding it, doing it a second time will make the button repeat without touching it, and a third time will reset the button to normal.
When it comes to evaluating gaming performance, I put about five hours into using the NYXI Hyperion 2. The first game I played was Metroid Prime Remastered, and with it being a first-person adventure/shooter, the Hyperion 2 really shined. Looking around and aiming at targets to lock on was so much easier thanks to the smooth analog sticks, so while you don’t necessarily need super-precise aiming in this game, the more robust sticks made it more enjoyable. Jumping is already set to one of the bumpers, but that also freed up both back buttons to be used for inputs like weapon switching or going into Morph Ball mode, which was convenient for me. Here, the Turbo function came in clutch – I set it to ZR so I could rapid-fire by holding ZR instead of having it do a charge shot, and I set the MR back button to shoot normally so I could still do charged shots when I needed.
Doing some cleanup in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was a ton of fun since I love exploring Hyrule for unfinished business, but again, it’s a great game for showcasing the Hyperion 2’s capabilities. I still prefer gyro aiming for making those minute adjustments, but the sticks are so precise that sometimes you don’t need motion controls, especially since the sticks recognize small movements off the deadzone. And having a back button for the sprint action is a godsend for me as well since I can keep controlling the camera at the same time.
I tend to avoid first-person shooters on Switch primarily for performance reasons, but also because playing handheld with the standard Joy-Con is straight-up bad. Like other great Joy-Con alternatives, the Hyperion 2 remedies the problem with its fantastic analog sticks that are on par with that of the Xbox Series X|S gamepad to make aiming much better – I’d even go as far to say that the nimble micro-switch triggers make firing and aiming-down-sights quicker and lighting on my fingers.
NYXI rates the Hyperion 2 to have a 10-meter wireless connection distance, which is a little over 30 feet, and that’s accurate. I never had any issues with connectivity when using it detached from the Switch. But since the Hyperion 2 does not come with a center grip to hold the two parts together, I can’t fully recommend it as a Pro controller replacement until one becomes available – that’s a bummer because every other aspect of it works as a full gamepad alternative as well.
Check out our roundup of thebest Switch accessories!
While battery life is good, it’s not quite as long as the normal Joy-Con (on account of its more sophisticated features). The Hyperion 2 lasts around 10 hours without RGB lighting and about five hours with RGB lighting on. That’s plenty of juice to use wirelessly, but these are meant to be used in the Switch’s handheld form so that wasn’t a major factor for me. Charging is done by being attached to the Switch itself, and the design doesn’t interfere with the console being docked. However, the Hyperion 2 does consume a bit more battery from your system. It wasn’t a noticeable difference, although it’s worth noting – I’m not exactly a stickler for squeezing every minute of battery life from my Switch, so it didn’t concern me all that much.
The NYXI Hyperion 2 is available for $79.99 (the same price as the regular Joy-Con) directly fromthe NYXI website.
I wish the NYXI Hyperion 2 came around much sooner, because it’s the best aftermarket Joy-Con set I’ve used throughout the Nintendo Switch’s lifecycle. Its clicky mouse-like buttons are responsive and easy on the fingers, the grips fill up my hands comfortably without being hefty, and the Hall Effect analog sticks blow the Joy-Con sticks out of the water. The back buttons are super convenient, and the simple Turbo function came in handy in some rare instances. If it came with an attachable grip for better use as a gamepad alternative and had an easier way to map the back buttons, this would be an even better package. First-party Nintendo accessories tend to come at a premium, so relative to the competition and its high quality, the NYXI Hyperion 2 is reasonably priced at $79.99 (which is the same as a new pair of regular Joy-Con). Is it too late to pick up given that the Switch 2’s Joy-Con sport an entirely new design? Maybe. But if you’re still in the market for a new Switch controller, the Hyperion 2 is a smart choice."
"Playing As Yasuke in Shadows Doesn’t Feel Like Assassin’s Creed, He’s Something New",2025-03-22T13:30:00Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/playing-as-yasuke-in-assassins-creed-shadows-doesnt-feel-like-assassins-creed,"Thanks to a renewed focus on the ideas the series was originally built on, Shadows is the most satisfying Assassin’s Creed has felt in years. You can fluidly move from ground to castle rooftop thanks to the best parkour system since Unity, and a grappling hook only makes the journey to a great vantage point even speedier. Perched on a tightrope high above the enemy, you’re only a drop away from scoring the perfect kill… provided you’re playing as Naoe, that is. Take control of Yasuke, Shadows’ second protagonist, and it’s a whole different game.

Yasuke is slow. He is clumsy. He can’t kill silently. And he climbs like a grandpa. He is the antithesis of an Assassin’s Creed protagonist. He is one of Ubisoft’s most baffling design choices… and one of its most fascinating. Because when I play as Yasuke, I don’t feel like I’m playing Assassin’s Creed anymore.
I initially found this gulf between Yasuke’s ability set and the fundamental philosophy of the series to be incredibly frustrating. What is the point of an Assassin’s Creed protagonist who can barely climb and can’t perform a silent takedown? But the more I’ve played as him, the more I’ve seen merit in Yasuke’s design. He’s unquestionably flawed, but I think he addresses a couple of very important issues that Assassin’s Creed has struggled with over the past few years.
A brief starring role in Shadows’ prologue aside, you don’t get to play as Yasuke until several hours into the campaign. It means that your entire settling-in period is spent controlling Naoe, a swift shinobi who fulfills the “assassin” part of Assassin’s Creed better than any series protagonist has for a decade. Switching to Yasuke after playing as Naoe for so long is jarring.
This towering samurai is too big and too noisy to effectively sneak through enemy camps, and is barely capable of climbing anything higher than his own head. He cannot find a handhold in the jutting roofs that line Japan’s streets, and when you do find something he’s able to climb, he does so painfully slowly. On rooftops, he precariously balances on the apex, standing upright for all to see as he cautiously inches forward. These impairments to Yasuke’s climbing abilities introduce friction. Scaling environments can feel like a chore, with structures like scaffolding and ladders required to make any significant progress.
All of this doesn’t exactlyforceYasuke to stay at ground level, but it certainly encourages it. This in turn denies him vision; without easy access to high vantage points it’s difficult to map out an area’s threats and plan accordingly. And where a grounded Naoe at least has the enemy-highlighting Eagle Vision to fall back on, Yasuke has nothing. Take up his blade and you’re agreeing to sacrifice almost everything other than raw strength.
If this sounds not a lot like Assassin’s Creed, it’s because it isn’t. The series has thus far been built around parkour-led exploration. Even when it has delved into areas of history where buildings were rarely more than one or two storeys high, verticality is still a core part of the flow. Being robbed of the series’ traditional climbing freedom and forced to follow more prescribed routes makes time spent as Yasuke feel much closer to playing Ghost of Tsushima than Assassin’s Creed – a feeling only emphasised by Yasuke’s lack of stealth training and reliance on his samurai sword skills. Embodying Yasuke is to play a game that’s first and foremost about fierce combat, something Tsushima is fondly remembered for and Assassin’s Creed often criticised over.
To play as Yasuke is to be asked to rethink how to play Assassin’s Creed. Historically, the series has allowed us to climb anywhere. Previous assassins have been knife-happy Spider-Men, armed with sticky hands that allow them to scale everything from towers to glaciers as if they were ladders. It is effortless and, as a result, it offers no challenge whatsoever. Yasuke changes this. While it’s true that there’s a lot beyond his grasp, careful observation of the environment reveals hidden pathways that have been built especially to allow Yasuke to reach his objectives. For instance, a leaning tree trunk protruding from an overcrop can lead you to a sync point that would otherwise be inaccessible without a grappling hook. A castle may have an open window on the second floor, easily entered if you follow the staircase-like arrangement of the courtyard’s exterior wall. Such paths are arguably more interesting to decipher than the practically thoughtless scrambles of past games.
These pathways only take Yasuke where heneedsto be, though. He has much less freedom when it comes to general exploration, and it’s difficult to gain the high ground to observe enemy patrol patterns. But Yasuke really doesn’t abide by the traditional Assassin’s Creed approach of assessing guard movements and planning ahead. His only real stealth ability is the “Brutal Assassination” skill, and… well, it involves impaling an enemy on his sword, lifting them three feet off the ground, and yelling. Not exactly inconspicuous, is it? Rather than a takedown, it’s an opening move for combat, kicking things off with an instant kill. And when things do kick off, things get good. They getreallygood. Shadows boasts the best swordplay Assassin’s Creed has had in over a decade. There’s purpose to each strike and a rich variety of techniques to pull on – from brutal rush attacks to satisfying ripostes. Finishing moves cleave heads from shoulders, an image that creates a clear contrast between Yasuke’s abilities and Naoe’s stealthy approach.
But there’s more than just contrast here; the separation of combat and stealth into two characters means there’s less bleeding between the two styles. In Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, far too many quests used direct conflict as the default interaction. As such, action became their primary language. In Shadows, the twin protagonist system safeguards against that; Naoe’s relative fragility means she can’t go full slaughter mode, so when combat does break out you’re eventually forced to flee, reposition, and reset the stealth loop. When you want a break from that tension, Yasuke’s strength ensures you’ll be able to survive the worst Shadows can throw at you. It’s the power that he brings to the party that makes him such a tantalising prospect in combat, especially once his flashy skill tree full of abilities unlocks over time.
There’s strong intention within Yasuke’s design, then. But it’s nonetheless difficult to see where he fits into Assassin’s Creed – this is a series built on stealthy kills and vertical exploration, ideas that Yasuke is in direct opposition to. While it’s true that the likes of Bayek and Eivor stepped much too far into action territory, they were still able to perform the fundamental actions of an Assassin’s Creed lead character. They climbed to the apex of temples and wielded hidden blades. While it is thematically appropriate for Yasuke, who is a samurai and not an assassin, to be bad at stealth and climbing, his design simply means you can’t play Assassin’s Creed like Assassin’s Creed while in control of him.
The real problem Yasuke faces, though, is his ally. Naoe is just the better option. She is, mechanically speaking, the best Assassin’s Creed protagonist in many years. Her stealth toolkit is complemented by Sengoku Period Japan, which allows for the towering verticality of architecture the series has been missing since Syndicate. Combined, these elements allow for an experience that truly fulfills the promise of Assassin’s Creed: becoming a highly mobile silent killer.
Naoe also benefits from the design changes that shape Yasuke – while she can climb up to practically anywhere in the world, the “stick to every surface” mantra of the series has been scrapped in favour of something slightly more realistic. This means you still have to assess climbing routes and find anchor points for your grappling hook, but you can leap further and climb faster – these are the fundamental things that turn an open world into an Assassin’s Creed sandbox. And when you are on the ground and in the thick of it, Naoe’s combat flow feels just as ruthlessly violent and impactful as Yasuke’s. She benefits from all of the swordplay enhancements he enjoys, just with the caveat that she can’t endure battle for as long as her samurai friend can. All of this raises the question: why would you play as Yasuke when you can play as Naoe?
Due to its admirable intent to offer two distinct playstyles with Yasuke and Naoe, Ubisoft has created a double-edged sword. The African samurai plays by very different rules to a classic Assassin’s Creed protagonist, which creates a contrasting and reasonably compelling experience that’s a genuine first for the series. But he is undeniably in direct opposition to the ideas upon which these games were built – ideas that remain largely unique in the open-world genre. So while I’ll always find time to return to Yasuke’s shoes to enjoy the vicious thrill of his blade, it’ll be through the eyes of Naoe that I truly explore Shadows’ world. Because when I play as Naoe, I feel like I’m playing Assassin’s Creed.

Deals For Today: Pokémon TCG Prismatic Evolutions Restock And PlayArts Assassin's Creed Statues Up For Preorder,2025-04-03T10:03:35Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-3-2025,"There’s a fine line between “I deserve this” and “this was a financial mistake,” and today’s deals are absolutely walking it. I’m looking at In Stock Pokémon bundles that practically dare you to stop at just one. Humble Choice is finally delivering a lineup that doesn’t feel like leftovers, and the Assassin’s Creed collectibles over in the IGN Store have officially moved from “maybe someday” to “I’ve added it to my cart twice already.”

In my opinion, these are the kinds of deals that are actually worth talking about — not the 7% off a charger you didn’t need to begin with. This is six-pack booster bundles available now, games I’ve had on my wishlist for too long, and statues that will silently judge you from a shelf while looking really, really cool. If you're going to buy stuff, at least let it be stuff that makes you happy and mildly ashamed.
From ourpreview: ""Based on the Loyal Three and their Moochi-feeding mythical master, Pecharunt, the Shrouded Fable set features some key players of thePokémon Scarlet & Violet DLC: Hidden Treasures of Area Zero, amongst new additions. It's a packed set, with Kingdra ex also making a royal splash in the expansion.""
This one’s a bit of a reality check. The actual MSRP for six of these packs is around $27, so Amazon is being bold by doubling that and calling it a deal. Still, given how hard Prismatic Evolutions is to find at retail without hunting down individual packs like a Pokédex-obsessed raccoon, this is sadly one of the better options right now. I wouldn’t call it a bargain, but if you’re just itching to crack open some fresh packs without resorting to third-party sellers, it gets the job done.
This is one of the few Pokémon TCG products still hovering close to MSRP, which basically qualifies it as a miracle in 2025. You get three solid booster packs, some stickers to slap on your laptop or emotional baggage, and a stackable tin that may or may not match the others in your accidental collection. It’s not flashy, but it’s a solid option if you just want some new packs to rip without playing the “Is this seller legit?” game.
This month’s Humble Choice doesn’t feel like a clearance rack, and that’s saying something. Tomb Raider is doing the nostalgia thing in the best way, and Dredge is that weird horror-fishing crossover I didn’t know I needed. Aliens: Dark Descent rounds it out if you like your sci-fi chaotic and stressful. Honestly, I’d pay the $12 just for those three — and still walk away feeling smug.
This bundle is a case of “available at a premium or not at all.” MSRP should be closer to $27, but good luck finding that price in the wild. The return of Shiny Pokémon is the big hook here, and that’s probably what’s driving the markup. I think it’s steep, but if you’ve been chasing the set and want to avoid eBay roulette, this is probably your safest play.
This is the kind of collectible that makes you pause and consider rearranging your entire shelf, your priorities, and your bank account. Some of these statues are genuinely beautiful. Others are so expensive they make me nervous just looking at them. But if you’ve got deep franchise loyalty and shallow impulse control, this is your moment.
Elite Trainer Boxes are rarely good dollar-per-pack deals, and this one’s no exception. But what you’re really paying for is the full kit: sleeves, promo card, storage box, and a mildly delusional sense of organization. I actually like this set for collectors who want more than just cards. It feels like a full-on project, and for $55, it’s one of the few Pokémon bundles that still comes close to feeling like it's worth the money.
This is the one I’d keep in my bag daily. It’s half an inch thick and can charge an iPhone 8 about 3.6 times or a Galaxy S22 almost twice. The USB-C port handles both input and output (a rarity at this price), and the dual USB-A ports mean you can charge multiple devices without carrying five bricks. It’s cheap, sleek, and has a literal paw print on it. Adorable and useful? Yes, please.
I think this is the sweet spot if you bounce between devices. You get three outputs, including one that’ll fast-charge a MacBook Pro 14"" or your Steam Deck while you’re multitasking. There’s even a pop-out phone stand built in. It’s like if your power bank also respected your time and your binge-watching habits. At under $40, it feels like a steal.
I picked up Death’s Door for five bucks and didn’t even hesitate. The Humble Store’s latest sale is packed with portable-friendly gems, perfect for a Steam Deck or travel laptop situation. Highlights include Dead Cells: Road to the Sea Bundle for $16.49 (50% off), Detroit: Become Human for just $11.99, and Dying Light Definitive Edition at $14.99. If your backlog needs more chaos, this is how you feed it on a budget.
This is my pick for weekend trips or carry-on duty. It’s got solid charging speed, a clean LED display that shows exactly how much juice is left, and enough capacity to last through a few full phone charges. It even handles smaller accessories like AirPods or smartwatches without flinching, which is more than I can say for some people.
This Gallica statue is up for preorder at $129.99, and yes, I want it just for the wings. It's 8.9 inches tall with glossy clear parts and Magla particles swirling on the base. The sculpt is absurdly detailed, which probably explains why I’ve already mentally cleared shelf space despite the fact it doesn't ship until November 2025. Patience is hard, but preorder now, panic later.
If I’m packing a laptop, a tablet, a phone, and something else probably unnecessary but still USB-powered, this is what I’m bringing. It hits 100W output, recharges itself fast via USB-C, and can handle charging multiple high-power devices at once. It’s a bit of a tank, but in the way you want when you're relying on it to keep everything alive.
If I had to pick a favorite just for everyday carry, it might be this one. It’s compact, fast, and charges three devices at once. I love the built-in phone stand, especially for killing time in waiting rooms or pretending I’m not watching TikTok in public. For $20, it’s a little charger that does a lot.
I don’t need six booster packs, but these are usually in and out of stock. ThisSurging SparksBooster Bundle has some fantastic chase cards, we're talking $400+ chase cards that could be in this Booster Bundle. It’s under $50, which in Pokémon terms is basically a clearance sticker. I'm not saying it'll change your life, but it might improve your afternoon.
This is the TV I’d buy if I wanted something that works without having to pretend I care about specs. It turns on, the picture’s 4K, it has Alexa so I don’t have to get off the couch, and it costs less than my last grocery run. Honestly, that’s more than enough.
I don’t usually gravitate toward games based on cartoons, but this bundle is stacked if you’ve got kids or just want a break from games that scream at you.Bluey, PAW Patrol, My Little Pony — the whole crew’s here, and honestly, they’re better made than half the AAA titles I’ve rage-quit. Pay $20 or more, get a pile of games, and support charity. Seems like a win for everyone except your free time.
I like this one because it feels unnecessarily large in the best way. You get Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and it still costs less than a concert ticket and a hoodie. If you want to make movie night feel intentional without spending your life savings, this does the job.
I want this on my shelf mostly so people ask what it is and I can pretend I understandDeath Stranding 2. It’s a 1/350 scale model of a massive mobile base from a game that hasn’t even released yet, and I respect the level of commitment required to care this much. It’s $69.99, which is fair for something this weirdly specific and detailed — and yes, the railgun is included.
This is the kind of TV I’d get if I wanted it to last longer than my attention span. It’s a 2024 model, has LG’s updated processor, and handles all the streaming stuff without having to download three extra apps just to log in. Feels like someone at LG actually thought it through.
I think this is what happens when Samsung realizes not everyone wants to spend $650 to track their steps. The titanium build is overkill in a good way, and the battery life means I don’t have to charge it every time I blink. It finally dropped to a price where it makes sense to buy one without feeling like I’m auditioning for a tech influencer role.
i’ve been watching theJourney TogetherElite Trainer Box like a hawk, and somehow it’s actually in stock at Amazon for $70.31. That’s 30% off apparantly, but it's not at all. It includes nine booster packs, a full-art N’s Zorua promo, sleeves, and the usual accessories, Most people just want the packs and the promo. If it’s gone when you check, keep trying. I’ve seen stock randomly reappear in the mornings and lunch time, just likeTarget's Journey Together stock.
Then there’s the Paldean Fates Booster Bundle at $69.77. Six packs inside, and the draw here is the return of shiny Pokémon. I like that it cuts straight to the good stuff — no sleeves, no dice, no cardboard fluff, just a clean bundle of packs ready to be cracked open. If you’re chasing shinies, this is where the hunt begins.
Humble Bundle’s “Best of Boomer Shooters 4” is live right now, and I love how chaotic it is. For $16, you get $174 worth of retro-inspired FPS games likeTurbo OverkillandForgive Me Father 2. I think of it as therapy, just with more blood and less talking about my feelings. You also support some good causes, so now your nostalgia trip is technically altruism. You're welcome.
Shrouded FableETB is holding steady at $54.96, and I think it’s slept on. It has nine packs, a Pecharunt foil, some sharp sleeves, and a player’s guide that you’ll absolutely ignore until you pull something weird and have to look it up. This set's all about the Legendary trio—Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti—and if you’re into building themed decks or hoarding off-meta cards, this one hits.
Finally, if your card obsession extends beyond Pikachu, the Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors’ Dreams trading cards are now up for pre-order on the IGN Store, starting at $20. I already pre-ordered a box because the idea of serial-numbered Chun-Li cards is somehow more exciting to me than it should be. Rare pulls, killer art, and a chance to relive the 90s one Hadouken at a time — I’m in.
I picked up one of the Paradox Clash tins just for fun and honestly, no regrets. For $39.96, you get five booster packs and either a Walking Wake EX or Iron Leaves EX promo, chosen completely at random. It’s a bit of a gamble, but opening tins is half the fun anyway. The promos are clean, the packaging is slick, and I think it makes a solid gift for anyone getting into the game
For a cheaper fix, I’d go for the $12.25 blister pack with three random boosters and a foil promo. It’s 39% off, which is honestly kind of wild, and it’s one of those no-risk purchases you can talk yourself into without too much guilt. The listing shows Silver Tempest Boosters, so there's a good chance of pulling some Sword and Shield chase cards here.This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.

Arkham Horror: The Board Game Buying Guide,2025-03-13T18:38:30Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/arkham-horror-the-board-game-buying-guide,"The Arkham Horror universe has a whole lot of games in its catalogue. In fact, there are so many to choose from that we’ve had to separate them into two guides. In this buying guide, we will go through the several families of board games. If you’re seeking information about the manydeck-building card gamesalso under the umbrella, you can click on over to ourArkham Horror: The Card Game Buying Guide.

Arkham Horror is an long-running franchise ofhorror board games. You and your fellow players embark on missions that involve a lot of communication to win. The games each have several pathways that can be taken depending on which roles, expansions, and campaigns you employ. These also make terrificsolo board gamesfor when you don't have a group on hand to spend an hour-plus playing a board game.
Want to skip the blurbs and go straight to the various games and expansions? Scroll through the catalog above. If you're interested in the nitty gritty of how all the items relate to one another and to the broad Arkham Horror universe in general, read on below.
Arkham Horror is acooperative board gamein which player teams work collectively against different sorts of terrors. You can take the journey through Arkham as one of six investigators to solve mysteries and defeat horrific beasts. The game has several campaigns to explore, and given the sizable luck component, whereby you have to roll to see if you pass certain objectives and bosses, along with the chance of chaos and occult trickery, well, the games are highly replayable.
But be warned: this is not an easy game. It takes a bit of time to set up and to teach to your group. The gameplay itself can last for multiple hours, or can be done fairly quickly if you and your ensemble of investigator partners aren’t lucky. (If you or your mates lose and there are fewer players than six, you can select another investigator to play as, but you’ll start over with that one, losing any additional stats that you’ve gained along the way. Dying kinda sucks, to be honest.) My first adventure with friends on the easiest campaign was disastrous. I’ve played it as asolo board game(yep, you can also do that here, too), but that didn’t go well, either. When you complete that first winning game, your whole party will cheer.
There are three expansions for the Arkham Horror: The Board Game. Each unlocks a different layer of depth to the base game.
The largest of the expansions is Under the Dark Waves. As the name suggests, this expansion is about the horrors that exist under the water. This big expansion brings eight new investigators on board for four new scenarios. It takes you out of the city and into the sea.
This is a medium-sized expansion that includes three new scenarios and three more investigators to travel through Arkham. Secrets of the Order opens up another neighborhood, so you'll explore French Hill while being mindful of the ghosts and monsters that may make your visit the opposite of a quaint French getaway.
Dead of Night is a smaller box expansion with a smaller price point to match. It has two more scenarios to add to your base game, plus four more investigators to help you navigate the horrors in the dead of the night.
There are a few other board games that act as their own separate Arkham universes. The games are not directly connected to Arkham Horror, so you don't need that base game to play them. Each of these games allows you and your friends to experience a different, stand-alone adventure within Arkham, using characters you may recognize from other iterations. Some of these titles are big enough to have expansions of their own.
Elder Sign was one of the first games in the Arkham Files franchise. It's adice-rolling board gamethat can be played by one to eight players. Of all the games in the Arkham Files, it’s the most accessible chance game. It is a separate standalone game with six physical companion expansions.
Gameplay is primarily governed by dice. While it’s not entirely like Yahtzee with monsters, rolling dice is the core driver of the game. You’ll have to roll dice to complete tasks and to work through six encounters. You roll dice depending on the stats of your chosen investigator to fight monsters, find clues, and work toward solving the mystery before time runs out.
Elder Sign has six expansions: Unseen Forces, Gates of Arkham, Omens of Ice, Grave Consequences, Omens of the Deep, and Omens of the Pharaoh. Grave Consequences is a standalone deck and can be played with or without the core game. The last expansion was released in 2018. It is currently unknown if there will be any more.
This is an app-drivendungeon crawler board gametake on the universe. The second edition is a standalone game that exists in the same universe as Eldrich Horror and Elder Sign. You can play it with one to five players using an app to help you through the narrative. The app guides you through setting up and playing the game. Narrative, roll results, and play direction can all be done in the app.
Personally, I dug playing with the combination of the tactical pieces and the app. And if you have to pause the game experience, the app allows you to come back later to finish where you left off. You’ll still have to set up your physical board game pieces when you play again, however, so you may want to take a picture to remember where everything should be.
There are two expansions for Mansions of Madness. Both of them are cooperative games that are guided by the app.
This expansion takes you to the depths of the jungle, where serpents and other Lovecraftian horrors will bring peril and pain to your adventure. Like the original, it is guided by an app, and you do need the base game to play it.
This expansion is significantly cheaper than the other one above. Beyond the Threshold opens two new investigators, two new scenarios, and an insanity gameplay element. Its low price point makes it the most accessible expansion to add to your game.
Unfathomable is about escaping a sea of monsters on a boat. It can be played with three to six players, though it’s best suited for groups of five or six. This game has a social deduction component, making it an immersive experience for larger groups. Someone is designated to be a traitor, and you won’t know who. It has Battlestar Galactica vibes to it, but in a Lovecraftian mythos atmosphere. Sessions take multiple hours while you navigate the game trying to figure out who among you is there to help and who wants you dead, while simultaneously trying to escape alive.
Unfathomable is a completely different experience than other games in the Arkham catalogue, making it sort of a love-it-or-hate-it type of deal. If you like Battlestar Galactica or other social deduction games, this may be a good option to explore.
This expansion introduces new prelude cards that offer varied starting conditions, as well as three new monstrous horrors (Shoggoth, the Drowned Spirit, and the Grasping Tendril), plus new skills, items, and boon cards.
Edrich Horror is a different, more worldly experience than the Arkham Horror board game. While Arkham Horror primarily exists in neighborhoods within the city proper (and the sea), Edrich Horror has players navigating cooperatively around the globe to complete objectives. Some have said that Eldrich Horror is like a sequel to a movie.
Some things have been changed and adjusted in Eldrich Horror that make it more accessible to beginner and mid-range gamers. It involves a far quicker setup than Arkham Horror does, which is an immediate plus for gamers who want to get things out and get playing quickly. Eldrich Horror also has simpler rules than Arkham Horror, making the ""teach"" a bit more entry-level-friendly.
That said, Eldrich Horror is more aboutstrategyand solving puzzles. Its first in the series was released in 2013.
There are eight expansions possible to play in Eldrich Horror. Those expansions are Forsaken Lore, Mountains of Madness, Strange Remnants, Under the Pyramids, Signs of Carcosa, The Dreamlands, Cities in Ruin, and Masks of Nyarlathotep.
There are a couple of other ways you can play in the Arkham universe outside of these standard board games. You can play a couple of the board games online. You can also try the franchise's first foray into the world oftabletop roleplaying games.
Arkham Horror released its first TTRPG late last year, with a starter set followed by a rulebook. I recommend trying the starter set first. Once you’ve gotten a feel for the rules and the game, you can choose to grab the rulebook to start your own journey.
The core starter set is super accessible for beginning players. It has a sample campaign to play through for folks who may be new to the TTRPG world, and does not require an experienced Game Master.
Once you've taken the starter set for a spin with your gaming group, you can pick up the Core Rulebook if you want to keep going on new TTRPG adventures in the Arkham Horror universe.
A digital version calledArkham Horror: Mother’s Embracewas released on Steam in 2021. It’s a single-player game that some might find similar to the Mansions of Madness board game expansion. Unfortunately, it only plays as a solo game. If you're open to solo treks into this universe, you can get this digital adventureon Steamoron Switchfor an MSRP of $19.99.
Solo or not, the digital version has gotten mixed reviews. IGN'sArkham Horror: Mother's Embrace reviewscored it a 5 due to lacking story execution. It fumbles with some heavy topics, which may deter some players from enjoying the Lovecraftian mythos.
There is also a digital version of Elder Sign available onSteamand mobile platforms. Elder Sign: Omens was released in 2011, but has received mostly positive reviews on Steam. It's quite affordable at only $5.99.
If you are a fan of Lovecraft mythos-themed games, as I am, Arkham Horror is absolutely worth exploring. One awesome thing is that you can play several of these games solo as well as with friends. They are each different and offer a unique presentation of the Lovecraftian worlds.
That said, these games are on the more difficult side. They have quite a bit of chance, which can drastically increase replayability as well as frustration. Setup and learning time can also take some time. You’ll find that the card games are easier to set up than the board games, even without expansions.

Netflix Says Kids Don't Care About Consoles: '8-Year-Olds Aren’t Dreaming of PlayStation 6',2025-03-28T18:05:18Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-says-kids-dont-care-about-consoles-8-year-olds-arent-dreaming-of-playstation-6,"Netflix's President of Games, Alain Tascan, is expecting a future generation that relies less on gaming consoles as major players like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo push forward with new hardware.

The lead of the streaming giant’s video game division shared his thoughts on how gaming fans might soon play their favorite titles during an interview withThe Game Businessthat took place following a Netflix presentation in San Francisco. During the event itself, Tascan was asked if the streamer had any intention of taking a crack at console gaming, but he’s not so sure younger gamers are even interested in what something like a PlayStation 6 could bring to the table.
“[When it comes to] console, we started to look at the future where the platform is agnostic,” he explained. “Look at the younger generation. Are eight year-olds and 10 year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6? I am not sure. They are wanting to interact with any digital screen, whatever it is, wherever it is, even in the car. With console you’re thinking about high definition, you’re thinking about the controller […] If we look at this older model, I think it will restrain us.”
Tascan told The Game Business that he’s got a soft spot for console gaming despite his concerns, specifically calling out Nintendo’s Wii as a personal favorite. He’s spent many years at studios such as EA, Ubisoft, and Epic Games in the past, so the idea of more traditional console game releases is far from foreign for him. For Netflix, though, things are trending in a different direction.
While the company has a proven track record for creating game adaptations for its IPs with subscription add-ons like Stranger Things 3: The Game, Too Hot to Handle: Love Is a Game, and more, it’s also experimented with giving users access to notable, familiar games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition. Each game can be played straight from a mobile phone if a subscriber chooses, and as Tascan clarified during that recent event, Netflix will be doubling down on this strategy as it develops party games and establishes itself as a hub for kids and gamer families.
“I am very vigorous about lowering friction and eliminating it if we can,” he told The Game Business. “I see that the subscription is friction as well. Maybe good friction because it makes business sense, but still we did the test of eliminating subscription for [mobile game] Squid Game: Unleashed. And we may do other tests.”
He continued: “But the other friction is having enough controllers for family. Having a piece of hardware that might be expensive, that’s another friction. Waiting for a game to download, that’s another friction. I am [looking at] all the obstacles, and asking if we can reduce them as much as possible.”
Netflix said in early 2024 that games engagement had tripled throughout 2023, signaling that it would continue investing in the space in the future after a 2021CNBCreport suggestedless than 1% of subscribers were tapping into its gamesofferings. In October 2024, the streaming giant cut back on its gaming ambitions when itshut down its AAA studio headed by former Overwatch, Halo, and God of War developers. AGame Developerreport from last month said cuts had also recently hit Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, a teamNetflix picked up in 2021.
As Netflix seeks to tap into a market that it expects to be uninterested in game consoles, there’s little reason to doubt we’ll see something like aPlayStation 6ornext Xboxfrom Sony and Microsoft, respectively. Nintendo, meanwhile, is teetering on the edge of a brand-new console generation with itshighly anticipated Switch 2 device. It will pull back the curtain on its new tech with a focused Direct presentation next week, with many fans expecting to hear more aboutwhat features the Switch 2 brings to the table, its release date, andhow pre-orders are being handled.

"Nintendo, Sony and More Japanese Game Companies Suffer Stock Market Plunge as Trump's Tariffs Hit Hard",2025-04-07T08:41:59Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-sony-and-more-japanese-game-companies-suffer-stock-market-plunge-as-trumps-tariffs-hit-hard,"Video game companies across Japan have suffered a dramatic stock market plunge sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

White House officials signalled what they describe as specific reciprocal tariffs on roughly 60 of the ""worst offenders"" to go into effect on 9 April. Japan is one of the countries subject to these customised tariff rates, at 24%.
Trump's officials say these countries charge higher tariffs on U.S. goods, impose ""non-tariff"" barriers to U.S. trade, or have otherwise acted in ways they feel undermine American economic goals.
Tariffs are essentially taxes placed on the cost of importing certain goods. While it's possible for companies in the supply chain to simply eat these costs, more often than not these taxes are passed onto consumers. And unfortunately for gamers, rising prices are very likely to impact tech and gaming goods.
Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark index closed down 7.8%, the ASX 200 in Australia lost 4.2%, and the Kospi in South Korea ended 5.6% lower. The Shanghai Composite closed 7.3% lower and Taiwan Weighted Index lost 9.7%. The Hang Seng was down by 12.5% in afternoon trading.
Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, rounded up the decline in video game stocks based in Japan as the market opening in the morning of April 7. Nintendo was down 7.35%, Sony 10.16%, Capcom 7.13%, and Sega 6.57%.
It's Monday 10am in Japan where Japanese game stocks currently react to these insultingly dumb tariffs like so:Nintendo -7.35%Sony -10.16%Bandai Namco -7.03%Konami -3.93%Sega -6.57%Koei Tecmo -5.83%Capcom -7.13%Square Enix -5.23%The mobile game companies do even worse.
Last week Nintendo shocked the video game world by announcinga delay to pre-orders of the Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S., blaming tariffs and the uncertainty they have caused across the world. The pre-orders were set to go live on April 9, but in the U.S. specifically they were postponed, with the June 5 release date said to be on-track. Pre-orders go live elsewhere on April 9 as planned.
Nintendo announced the Switch 2 at $449.99, with a Mario Kart World bundle priced $499.99.Mario Kart World itself is priced $79.99.
Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad had warnedthat Trump's surprise tariffs on countries such as Vietnam, where Nintendo had shifted some of its Switch 2 manufacturing in anticipation of U.S. tariffs on China, might have caused a rethink.
""While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset U.S. tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world,"" Ahmad said. ""The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect.""
Nintendo fansandanalystsare now concerned Nintendo will raise the price of the Switch 2 and its games even further, even asit suffers a backlash to its pricing following the console’s reveal.
There are question marks over Sony, too, which manufactures PlayStation consoles, including the $700 PlayStation 5 Pro. IGN has asked the company if it has any comment on the prospect of increased prices in the U.S.
Goldman Sachs now forecasts there is a 45% chance the U.S. will fall into recession in the next 12 months, up from a previous estimate of 35%. JPMorgan now sees a 60% chance of a U.S. and global economic downturn.
According to a report by theBBC, Trump has defended the tariffs, saying ""sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.""

Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 Review (2025),2025-03-31T23:34:50Z,https://www.ign.com/articles/gigabyte-aorus-master-16-review-2025,"The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is the company's latestlaptop designed for the upper crust of gamers-on-the-go. It comes to market with your choice of an RTX 5080 or RTX 5090 (an RTX 5070 Ti version will be available later), while prices start at $3,099 and go up from there. Paired with its Intel Core 9 Ultra processor, it offers top-tier performance, gamer-friendly looks, and a great display. It’s not the laptop to choose for “thin and light,” but if you don’t care about that, it has a lot to offer.

The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is a flashy laptop with plenty of RGB and decorations to suit your fancy. Like many of the 16-inch launch models we’ve seen since Nvidia debuted its RTX 50-series laptop GPUs last week, it features a 2,560 x 1,600 OLED display with a boxier 16:10 aspect ratio than a normal widescreen laptop, and plenty of horsepower under its hood.
And AI, it has that too – and it wastes no time letting you know it’s there. Within minutes of booting it up for the first time, a notification was popping up from my “GiMate” assistant, letting me know that I should disable the Nvidia graphics card for better performance. AI is also interwoven with its configuration software, but more on that later.
The laptop is available in two configurations for now, separated by your choice of an RTX 5080 or RTX 5090 and about $1,200. Both versions come with the following specs, apart from the 5090 version which adds a second NVMe SSD for 2TB of total storage (you can add a second drive to the 5080 variant on your own if you’re tech-inclined):
Both models are expensive, but that goes with the territory when it comes to flagship gaming laptops right after a new launch. The RTX 5080 version I received to test costs $3,099. The RTX 5090 version will set you back $4,299. There’s also a larger Aorus Master 18 version of each that swaps the OLED screen for mini-LED and includes 2TB of storage by default. The RTX 5090 version there also bumps total system memory up to 64GB, which really isn’t bad for only $100 more than the 16-inch version ($4,399). The Aorus Master 18 with the RTX 5080 is a bit more marked up at $3,299, but at this kind of price, an extra hundo probably isn’t going to be the big decision-maker.
The Aorus Master is certainly designed to catch your eye and tempt a purchase in other ways. It’s an RGB showcase with an illuminated falcon logo on the lid, a wraparound 3D light bar, and even a small RGB projector that beams Aorus branding down onto your desk. The keyboard is also RGB, but it’s not per-key, which is disappointing at this price. Instead, it is broken into three zones and includes seven translucent keys that include WASD as well as Q, E, and R, with bright light passthrough. Even without per-key customization, it’s more than a little showy.
Everything but the lid is made from plastic. Functionally, it doesn’t make a huge difference, though an aluminum frame would be far better matched to its high price (and would help dissipate heat at the same time) and would have made it feel a bit more premium. The lid is very nice, however, and has a ripple pattern creating a wave pattern across its surface. It’s microtextured with such fine detail that you can only see it when it catches the light just so and feels smooth to the touch.
In fact, I first realized it wasn’t bead-blasted purely from sound. It reminds me of thezipyou get when you drag your nail across an old-school holographic Trapper Keeper. This quality makes it impervious to fingerprints in normal use, which immediately gives it a one-up on normal metal lids which tend to look grungy after a handful of uses.
The laptop isn’t thin and it’s not light. Unlike theRazer Blade 16which checks off both of those boxes while toting an RTX 5090, the Aorus Master is much more to expectation, measuring 0.9 inches at its thinnest and 1.14 inches at the thickest. It also weighs 5.5 pounds. Compare that to the Blade 16’s 0.69-inch front lip and 4.7 pound weight: it doesn’t seem like much on paper, but it’s immediately noticeable. Those small dimensional changes make the difference between “wow, this is surprisingly thin and light” and “yup, that’s definitely a gaming laptop.”
That extra space has its benefits, though. The Aorus Master offers both upgradeable memory and storage. There are two memory slots, allowing you to increase its capacity up to 64GB or swap out to a set with faster clock speeds. There are two M.2 slots for NVMe SSDs, so you can add extra storage without needing to reinstall Windows and drivers to get running again. Only the pre-populated slot supports PCI-e 5.0, however, so you’ll be limited to PCI-e Gen 4 for anything you’d like to add without formatting.
It also allows Gigabyte to go full-on with its other components. This machine is packing an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU with a full, 175-watt RTX 5080 (or other 50-series GPU). The processor is fast, topping out at 5.4GHz to maximize in-game fps and offers 24 cores (eight P-Cores and 16 E-Cores) cores for great multitasking performance and workload efficiency. It’s enough to make you wonder why Gigabyte only outfitted the laptop with 5,600 MHz memory when higher speeds would seem like the better match. The Razer Blade 16 uses 8,000MHz memory, for example, and higher memory speeds can directly translate into high fps.
To keep this hardware cool, Gigabyte has opted for a dual fan solution with densely packed, 158-fin fans. These come in new housing that's supposed to channel airflow better and also reduce their overall noise. It's still a gaming laptop, however, which means you should plan on hearing those fans quite prominently when you're running games. For web browsing and productivity use, it features a 0dB mode that relies on passive cooling when the components aren't generating as much heat. Like the Razer Blade 16, it features a large vapor chamber that covers more than 50% of the motherboard for improved performance overall.
The keyboard and trackpad are both decent. The keys have a generous amount of travel at 1.7mm and good tactility to avoid typos. I didn't find them to be especially mushy, but have experienced crisp typing experiences, such as the one on the Lenovo Legion 9i. Still, it gets the job done in a very familiar 75% layout that balances productivity and gaming performance.
The trackpad is also fine. It measures just over 5 inches by 4 inches and has a nice glide when swiping your finger across it. The integrated buttons work well, though I did find that left and right clicks could get a little confused the further up the trackpad you tried to make them. This is something that you get used to over time and is part of the process of learning a laptop. But taken together, the input experience is good but not particularly special in any way.
If you're planning on using the laptop for work or taking online classes, you can rest assured that it comes with a built-in 1080p webcam. In proper lighting conditions, it can look decent and offers a crisp, if slightly over-sharpened image. If you have a bright window behind you or are taking meetings in low lighting, it struggles to balance lighting and noise/grain in the image. There is no privacy shade, so you will have to manually turn it on and off if that's something you look for.
Audio quality is pretty typical for a gaming laptop. It uses four speakers total and they did a good job of getting loud enough to play games on, but their tiny size prevented them from sounding full for explosions or the bass register in music. You can use them if you need to, but agood gaming headsetis going to be the better choice for audio quality.
The Aorus Master 16 sports a 99WHr battery, which is the largest that can be used in a laptop currently. In our Procyon Office Battery Life test, it was able to run for seven hours and 49 minutes. With Advanced Optimus, Nvidia’s system for automatically swapping between the RTX 5080 and the integrated GPU, it meant that the test ran in its entirety without the full-powered graphics card turning on. When actually playing games, I averaged around two hours depending on how demanding the game was. RTX 50-series GPUs really seem to be coming into their own for gaming on battery.
Finally, for connectivity, it offers a decent array of ports to connect different peripherals and accessories. On the left side, it has a gigabit ethernet port, a full size HDMI 2.1, a USB 3.2 Type-A port, and a USB Type-C port capable of both charging and video, as well as a dedicated charging port for its included power bright. On the right is another USB Type-A and Type-C, an audio combo jack, and a microSD card reader. Size has its benefits.
In what's sure to be a trend this year, the Aorus Master 16 features a software suite that's integrated with AI. It offers all of the usual functionality, including setting your performance modes and fan settings, as well as customizing the laptop's RGB. For meetings, there are AI clarity enhancements as well as versions of the Windows Studio setting to blur your background and add artificial eye-tracking, as well as a privacy-enhancing feature that can turn off your screen when you’ve stepped away.
The most important feature that it offers is that it can intelligently control the performance of your system based on what you're doing. When you load a game, it's smart enough to know to use the RTX 5080 instead of the processor's integrated graphics chip, and then to switch that back over when you're done to save on battery life. There’s also a chatbot that you can engage with to get insights into your system, adjust settings, and converse with on troubleshooting, learning more about what settings do within Windows, and more. It’s essentially a local version of ChatGPT that knows about the specifics of your system.
While all of this is cool, it’s all pretty base level. Automatic performance switching is a nice feature, but if you’ve gamed on a laptop before, you already know to switch to its high performance mode. That the AI can detect a big workload also isn’t all that impressive, and swapping modes when it does isn’t something that requires “AI.” The chatbot can be fun, but unless you’re wet behind the ears when it comes to Windows gaming, it really feels like more of a novelty.
But we knew this was going to happen. AI is the trend of the moment and I expect most big laptop brands will follow suit with systems of their own. Use it if you like or ignore it if you don’t, both are viable options.
The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is in a class where performance is rightfully king, and whether or not it’s going to earn your dollars is going to depend a lot on what you’re coming from, what you’re hoping to achieve, and how much you have to spend.
Before sharing performance numbers, it's worth mentioning again that we'verecently upgraded our testing methodologyto better assess new technologies, rendering methods, and the performance demands of current games. Because of this, much of our prior testing data doesn’t align and we’ll be building up our data set over time. For this review, I’ll be comparing it to the Razer Blade 16 in the performance charts, but I was also able to do some testing with an RTX 4080 laptop on loan to remark upon in the text.
All of our tests are conducted at maximum settings. Upscaling is frequently used and is set to Quality at 1080p and Balanced at 1440p (or 1200p and 1600p in this case). These settings are also included in the charts.
Beginning with synthetic tests, we can see that the Aorus Master 16 performs quite well compared to the Razer Blade 16, despite the fact that it is running an RTX 5080 instead of an RTX 5090. Between the two systems, the Razer Blade is running an AMD Ryzen CPU, while the Aorus Master 16 is running an Intel Core Ultra CPU. This accounts for some of the differences here. However, it's also worth remembering that the Razer Blade 16 is power capped at 160 watts and frequently doesn't reach that limit, whereas the Aorus Master 16 can dynamically boost to the full 175 watt rating of the RTX 5080, pulling in higher performance.
What I find even more interesting is that in anecdotal testing against my end-of-last-gen Falcon Northwest DRX RTX 4080 system, the results are almost all close enough that you can chalk it up to margin of error. It's worth noting that the DRX system has a different processor, so the comparison isn’t exactly apples to apples. Still, the 40-series impresses. That doesn’t take away from the comparative performance of the 5080 versus the 5090, however, especially looking at that Night Raid score and its performance in real-world games.
Gaming benchmarks are just as revealing. Here we can see that at 1200p, the Aorus Master 16 outperforms the Razer Blade 16 with its power-capped RTX 5090. That’s shocking. At the same time, when I ran some of these tests against the Falcon Northwest DRX, the two went back and forth offering very similar performance in these games and beyond. The Blade 16 still pulls out some wins in a wider selection of playtests, averaging 62 fps in Black Myth: Wukong while the others hovered closer to 50, but there’s a serious value consideration here.
Now, an important caveatdoesneed to be given regarding the Razer Blade 16. It intentionally trades performance for portability, so it’s competing with a handicap. If you don’t care about it being as thin and light as possible, another RTX 5090 laptop may very well be a better choice. I’ll be testing exactly that in the weeks to come.
Another important consideration is fan noise. A loud laptop can draw unwanted attention and the Aorus Master 16, unfortunately, falls into that camp. Essentially, anytime you’re gaming, its fans will be running full throttle, and it’s loud enough to disturb a partner trying to watch a show in the room with you. I certainly wouldn’t play games in a library with it unless I could move well away from other people. Compared to the Blade 16, it’s much louder, which illustrates the competing visions for these products held between Razer and Gigabyte.
Here's the thing: Nvidia hasn't been shy about tying the 50-series to its AI capabilities versus pure native rendering performance. Though the RTX 5080 performs disappointingly close to the RTX 4080, this disappears when you're playing a game that supports multi-frame generation. While ""fake frames"" have become a bit of a meme, the fact is that when it works, it's pretty amazing and dramatically improves performance. This varies game to game based upon how well it handles latency. Alan Wake 2, for example, tends to feel a bit more laggy at higher multiplier settings while Cyberpunk 2077 does not. With this technology and others, like neural shaders, coming to future games, there’s an argument to be made about buying into these future technologies. But, you’re buying on a promise while Nvidia and game developers work to add support to new and existing games.
When it comes to living with the laptop on a daily basis, it offered snappy performance for just about anything I threw at it, including photo and video editing. I tend to prefer a laptop that's significantly lighter since I carry the laptop throughout my whole day; however, if you’re already used to carrying a gaming laptop, this won't feel very different. But, I would highly encourage anyone considering this to purchase a separate GaN charger for anytime you don't plan to play games. Its charging brick is big and heavy, and carried with the laptop brings the total weight to more than seven pounds. It was enough to leave me with a sore shoulder at the end of the day.
The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is available in two configurations at launch, one with an RTX 5090 and 2TB of storage at $4,300 and the RTX 5080 version tested here, which comes with a 1TB SSD for $3,100. It can be purchased fromAmazon,B&H,Newegg,Memory Express, andCanada Computers. Best Buy, and Micro Center are planned to offer availability in the future.
The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is a fine example of an RTX 50-series laptop, but as with our launch review of the architecture as a whole, it doesn’t make sense if you’re already running a 40-series gaming laptop. For anyone on an older system that wants high-level performance with access to features like Multi Frame Generation, that’s another story. Still, for such a high price, it’s hard to ignore the plastic frame, three-zone keyboard, and chonky build. If you’re after RTX 5090-esque performance for more than $1,000 cheaper, however, it’s a good way to save some cash while still getting those delicious, delicious frames."
