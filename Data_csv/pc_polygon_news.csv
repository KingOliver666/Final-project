Are PC handhelds like Steam Deck really competitors for Switch 2?,2025-04-04T21:19:21Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553131/pc-handhelds-steam-deck-vs-switch-2,"They compete closely on price and specs, but Nintendo still owns the mass market
byOli Welsh
When Nintendo launched the Switch in 2017, it had no competition in dedicated handheld gaming, a sector it had established with the Game Boy in 1989 and ruled ever since. Sega had come and gone; Sony, after two determined attempts with the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita, had just about given up.
As Switch 2 nears launch in 2025, things look a little different — but only a little. The colossal success of the Switch has awoken the slumbering giants. Sony and Microsoft are now reportedly preparingdedicated PlayStationandXbox handhelds. Improbably, though, it was the PC gaming sphere that made the first move. Valve led the way with the Steam Deck in 2022, which swiftly seeded a growing ecosystem of similar, PC-based handheld devices from manufacturers like Lenovo and Asus. After a quiet decade, non-Nintendo handheld gaming is a thing again. And that means the Switch 2 will not run unopposed for handheld gaming supremacy.
In a sense, Nintendo is the victim of its own strategic foresight. With the Switch, it was the first to spot that the narrowing gap in processing power between mobile and at-home devices had enabled a unification of handheld and home gaming experiences. Finally, the same games could work in both contexts. The Switch proved this point emphatically, and now everyone wants a piece.
But with dedicated devices from Sony and Microsoft still years away, for now that competition must come from Steam Deck and the other PC handhelds. My colleague Chris Plante persuasively argued that these devices representNintendo’s “biggest threat in the present.”They trounce the Switch on specs and have closed the gap to contemporary AAA gaming in the home until it’s almost imperceptible. Software-wise, they offer the compelling value and staggering range of just about everything on Steam — and much of PC gaming beyond it, if you’re prepared to fiddle about a bit.
It’s true that the Switch 2’s price and specs put it into direct competition with the lower-end PC handhelds. At $449, it’s $50 more expensive than the base model Steam Deck. The Switch 2 isroughly comparable in power and storage, has a much better screen, and with detachable controllers and a TV dock included in the price, it’s much more flexible to use. The base model of Asus’ ROG Ally handheld ($499 or thereabouts) and the new Lenovo Legion Go S ($549) are also pretty close competitors in terms of specs.
In raw hardware terms, these are all very similar devices. It’s worth noting that the Switch 2’sexclusive accesstoNvidia’s market-leading DLSS upscaling technologyshould allow it to punch a bit above its weight class. But realistically, there’s not much between them.
But — and it’s a very, very big but — comparing the Switch 2 to the PC handhelds by running your finger down a spec sheet, or by noting that they can all playCivilization 7andElden Ring, does not tell the whole story. Within an enthusiast bubble, PC handhelds are a big deal, but they do not exist in the same universe as Nintendo consoles. To put it bluntly, PC handhelds are still niche.
The Steam Deck has been a big success for Valve, but let’s put it in perspective. Valve has not discussed sales numbers, but market research estimates thatit has sold around 4 million Steam Decks. And Steam Deck dwarfs its competition; the same research suggests that, in total, around 6 million PC handhelds have been sold in the three years since the Steam Deck went on the market. Worryingly, there aren’t yet signs of strong growth in sales.
Stack that up against the Switch’s 150 million units sold and the wild difference in scale becomes evident. Of course, it isn’t a directly analogous comparison. PC handhelds have only existed for three years; the Switch has been around for eight years, and Nintendo has been in the handhelds business for more than 35 years. All the same, Nintendo predicts it will sell11 million units of the aging Switchin its current fiscal year — more than five times the predicted sales of PC handhelds in that time. Meanwhile, analysts reckon that theSwitch 2 will, on its own, outstrip the size of the PC handheld marketalmost immediately, with 6 to 8 million units available at launch, and up to 20 million sales in its first year.
Valve is a big player in the game industry, and a very rich company. But it is a newcomer to the world of consumer electronics retail, and it has a lot of catching up to do — if it’s even interested in doing it. Steam Deck isn’t available to purchase in stores; you can’t walk into Walmart and pick one up. Valve is not buying ads for it on TV or at bus stops. Companies like Lenovo and Asus have more traditional distribution channels, but they’re tiny minnows compared to the marketing, retail, and distribution might of Nintendo.
There are other factors that make the PC handhelds niche products. The user experience of Windows-based handhelds like the ROG Ally and Legion Go is notoriously bad. Valve’s SteamOS is much better, but it is still quite far removed from the reliability and simplicity offered by Nintendo and the other console platforms.
You cannot unbox a new Steam Deck, turn it on, and play a game straight away. It requires tinkering to get the best out of. Although Valve’s verification system for games is a helpful guide, it’s not guaranteed you’ll get a good, playable experience on every game. The Deck is also bulky and heavy. You would never buy one for a child, or share one within a family — it’s clearly not designed to be shared. Realistically, it remains a tough sell for anyone who isn’t a gaming hobbyist.
There is, reportedly, one upcoming device that may be able to change this narrative a little. Microsoft is said to be working with a PC handheld manufacturer ona system that will have Xbox brandingand a user interface based on a new version of the Xbox PC app. This has the potential to be a more user-friendly device that offers easy access to PC Game Pass on the go, which would be quite compelling. But, although Microsoft has now been making Xbox consoles for over 20 years, it hasconsistently struggledto use that experience to make PC gaming more seamless, despite repeated attempts — and the device doesn’t sound like much more than a stopgap until Microsoft’s own dedicated handheld console is ready.
Nintendo will not have true competition in handhelds until its peers in the console space get involved. Microsoft is reportedly eyeing 2027 for the release of its handheld Xbox. Sony’s portable PS5 is also said to be years away, if it’s ever released. Things are definitely heating up for Nintendo, and by the end (or even the middle) of the Switch 2’s life, the handheld gaming market is sure to be much busier than it is now. But for the next few years, competition for the new console will remain distant — at best.

I’ve been ensnared into the wild life of a drug dealer in Schedule 1,2025-04-04T16:56:45Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/553156/schedule-1-impressions-weed-drug-game,"Schedule 1 is currently hovering near the top of the Steam charts

There’s something wrong with this town; it’s immediately apparent as soon as I arrive. I’ve recently fled my humble desert hometown after my uncle was raided by the cops and his criminal enterprise was seized. I’m working on rebuilding the empire here in the sleepy town of Hyland Point, but there are a few problems to deal with. First of all, I need to learn the ropes of how to grow weed, cook meth, and maintain a customer base. Secondly, a rival criminal organization firebombed my RV. Finally, the cops remain a constant hassle. That’s just life inSchedule 1, a surprisingly expansive drug dealing simulator with some wacky twists, all created by a solo developer.
Schedule 1has risen through the Steam ranks and maintains popularity because it has a really satisfying core gameplay loop. Much likePalworld, the first big surprise hit of 2024,Schedule 1liberally borrows from other simulator games and different genres. I can play single-player, in which case I handle every element of the operation: growing, packaging, selling, expanding. Or I can rope in up to three friends and we can each handle part of the business.
Every part of theSchedule 1drug empire is built around a minigame, most of which are satisfying. For instance, I don’t particularly care for cooking meth, but I find managing the supply chain to be satisfying. If I run into any downtime during gameplay, no worries — I stole a TV from my motel room and it has some minigames on it, likeSnake,Pong, or a game where I play an egg in sunglasses with his balls hanging out. Nowthisis gaming.
Early on, the main obstacle I have to worry about is the police. Occasionally, an officer will search me, looking for anything illegal. They set up blockades between neighborhoods, demanding to search my vehicle if I hit one. The cops are barely a problem for me, though; I have a 100% success rate at just sprinting away from them at top speed. Even if I shoot an officer, they’ll forget everything after a couple of minutes. Weirdly enough, the thing they are firmest on is the town curfew. After 6 p.m., everyone has to get inside, or risk being arrested. I’ve found myself hiding in a bush or scared off my patio by a police patrol, who treat curfew-breaking as the worst possible sin. It’s like living in a weirdFootloosetown, except everyone’s constantly smoking a joint.
Life in Hyland Point feels like a very simplified take on the Grand Theft Auto franchise, complete with crass jokes. For instance, a local dining establishment across from my starting motel room is called Taco Ticklers. One customer is tragically dubbed “Peter File.” These jokes are so unsophisticated, they’re single entendres. If you’re not a fan of cheap, lazy jokes, then you’ll likely find yourself irritated bySchedule 1. The other night, I buckled down to experiment with mixing variants and creating new weed strains, most of which had names like “Big Cum” or “Magic AssBlaster.” The graphics are similarly simplified and cartoony, like a basic claymation setup or a 3D episode ofSouth Park.
A lot of work has gone into designing the steps of creating drugs viaSchedule 1’s minigames, but an opening screen warns me that none of it is accurate to real-world processes. Regardless, it’s satisfying to tinker in my workshop, creating weed with incredible new properties. Eventually, I become a living god in Hyland Point, and my disciples are smoking the dankest blunts imaginable. Some let me sprint faster than any car, and one strain variable even lets me fly. I can buy cars from the local auto dealership, but there’s not much point when I have a pocketful of magic weed.
Much like the aforementionedPalworld, I think this game will eventually become stale and I’ll put it back on the shelf.Schedule 1is an early access game that just came out, and so there are things that just feel incomplete. The police are toothless, the rival syndicate who blew up my RV in the start of the game has yet to reemerge, and the developer maintains a Trello that lists potential ideas ranging from “sewer network” to “weather” to “cartel fighting.”
I suspect I’ll find myself returning toSchedule 1as it receives patches, since the core gameplay is so satisfying. While my co-op server has gotten relatively far into creating illicit substances like high-end meth and cocaine, my solo game has stalled as I save up enough money for a larger property. Eventually, I’ll have conquered everything Hyland Point has to offer. For now, I’m just enjoying the ride, and I expect that trip will only grow richer in time.
Schedule 1is available on Steam for $20, and there’s a demo available for free. I’ll continue to follow its developer, who goes by Tyler’s Video Game Studio, as this game already has a lot of strengths. Even if the novelty will eventually wear off, I’m content for now to let Tyler cook.
Schedule 1was released March 24 in early access on Windows PC. The game was reviewed on PC using a download code purchased by the author. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

A custom Nvidia processor is at the heart of theNintendo Switch 2, giving it power to push up to 120 frames per second in handheld mode, or up to 4K at 60 frames per second while docked.
While Nintendo has been cagey to share more details on its partnership with the graphics and AI giant, Nvidia published ashort press releaseconfirming the collaboration — and diving a little more deeply into the tech found in Nintendo’s surprisingly capable handheld.
It name-dropped a lot of features that are commonly tossed around in the world of PC gaming. For one, the Switch 2’s 7.9-inch 1080p LCD display has G-Sync support baked in, and its variable refresh rate (VRR) support will ensure that you won’t notice fluctuations in frame rate as easily. Nvidia shared that the Switch 2 has “10x the graphical performance of the Nintendo Switch,” and that it uses DLSS to upscale graphics in games. Also, developers will be able to take advantage of ray tracing in the Switch 2.
Additionally, Nvidia’s tech supports other tentpole features of the Switch 2, includingGameChat. Nvidia’s AI Tensor Cores are used to focus on face tracking while removing the background (giving that green screen streamer look).
“With 1,000 engineer-years of effort across every element — from system and chip design to a custom GPU, APIs and world-class development tools — the Nintendo Switch 2 brings major upgrades,” says Nvidia’s press release.

Using the Switch 2’s Joy-Con mouse is only kind of like using a mouse,2025-04-03T12:36:35Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551761/joy-con-switch-2-mouse-hands-on-review,"We played Metroid Prime 4 with a Joy-Con mouse. Here’s what that’s like

We played Metroid Prime 4 with a Joy-Con mouse. Here’s what that’s like
byChelsea Stark
Nintendo announced that its Switch 2 Joy-Cons could beused as a mouse— in either hand, even — during itsSwitch 2 Directon April 2. Mice and other pointers have been aiding in making certain game movements more precise for decades, so the idea of a console-based mouse is tempting, if it’s implemented well.
During a hands-on event in New York City on Wednesday, I was able to test the Joy-Cons’ mouse mode on a few different gameplay experiences specifically designed to highlight it. Nintendo is a company known for unique (or sometimes gimmicky) implementations of control schemes, yet the mouse has had decades of refinement for computer gaming. Some of the experiences I had using the Joy-Con as a mouse felt traditional, but some left me scratching my head as to whether they would receive wider adoption.
The new Joy-Con — called Joy-Con 2 — has been given extra heft and sturdiness compared to the first iteration. They fill my hands a bit more comfortably without being too much wider. When I’m sliding them on their sides, it doesn’t seem like they will accidentally tip over. I found that the mouse could also register on different types of surfaces; while Nintendo provided nice, cushy, desk-sized mouse pads to use during demos, I also triedsliding the mouse up and down my corduroy pantsto simulate “gamer conditions” of playing in the wild. There really wasn’t too much of a difference, as long as the surface was wide enough to handle a mouse swipe.
For a demo ofMetroid Prime 4:Beyond, I used the mouse (while standing at a desk, which felt slightly awkward!) to gun down enemies. The movement felt mostly comparable to that of any first-person shooter I’ve played on a computer — although in PC games, mouse controls aren’t usually paired with the lock-on technology Samus still uses inBeyond. But it did feel fairly natural to aim and look around with the Joy-Con mouse. This was slightly complicated by the fact that the face buttons were now rotated, so finding the right one was less intuitive while trying to scan doors, fire missiles, or activate Samus’ morph ball mode. I felt like I was constantly hitting the wrong button during my demo because of the adjustment.
The end of theMetroid Prime 4demo featured a boss covered in glowing weak spots for which I couldn’t use the auto lock-on, meaning I had to rely on the mouse’s precision aiming — or lack thereof, due to the removal of lock-on mechanics — to take it down. I wonder how much this will feature in the full game, and if the Switch 2 version of the game will highlight the mouse more than the Switch version.
Meanwhile, inDrag x Drive, using the Joy-Con as a mouse was less about aiming and precision and more about endlessly sliding it. In a game that feels meant to highlight Switch 2 features rather than be fun, I was endlessly swiping with both hands to build speed as a little robot wheelchair user, then swiping one or the other Joy-Con mouse to turn. The idea is easy to understand, but despite it feeling like a smaller-scale version of rowing, I struggled for a bit to figure out how to move smoothly. Thankfully, throwing passes to my teammates or making baskets felt very generous, because most of my time withDrag x Drivewas spent just on mastering movement. It’s hard for me to envision setting this game up in a room with the amount of space I might need for the mouse movements, even if I could use my legs instead of a flat surface.
I’m so curious to see this concept extended to other games beyond these demos, as a mouse has so much potential for console gaming. But it might require dedicated resources for developers to figure out how to best implement the Switch 2’s mouse functionality — it’s really not like anything else out there, since it can work in either (or even both) of the user’s hands but will still need to accommodate button presses on the Joy-Con as well.

Nintendo wants to compete in a new type of console war,2025-04-02T19:26:30Z,https://www.polygon.com/analysis/551719/nintendo-switch-2-console-war,"Why Nintendo wants Madden and Borderlands on its new handheld
byChris Plante
Nintendo took an unusual approach to the past two decades of video game console wars. It stayed out of them. But with today’sNintendo Switch 2 info dump— packed with big-name third-party games rarely seen onNintendo hardware— the House that Mario Built appears ready to rejoin the fray. Why now? Credit a collision of confidence, opportunity, and necessity.
Sony and Microsoft have spent generations bloodying each other in a battle for the most extravagant visuals, courting favor with major publishers like Activision and Electronic Arts. Meanwhile, Nintendo swam in the opposite direction, favoring cheaper, less powerful machines that prioritized toy-like novelty over raw specs.
The historic successes of both the Wii and the Switch obscure how risky this gamble has been. The slower hardware — with a few, better-forgotten exceptions — couldn’t run the latest entries in gaming’s most popular franchises, including Madden, Call of Duty, and Grand Theft Auto. Survival hinged on Nintendo’s ability to produce multiple exclusive hits each year, with smaller indie titles filling the gaps.
With the Switch, everything went Nintendo’s way — by both design and good fortune. The publisher assembled arguably the greatest first-party lineup in history. Indie development exploded. And a new wave of beloved IP —Minecraft,Fortnite, Roblox — designed for smartphone-level specs meant that Nintendo’s hardware, unintentionally, could play some of the biggest games on the planet.
And yet, today, Nintendo’s hourlongSwitch 2reveal stream featured anabundance of titlesonce rare on its systems. 2K Games showed off new entries in the WWE, Civilization, and Borderlands franchises. Other developers, like IO Interactive, pledged to bring hits once best experienced on Xbox or PlayStation, like Hitman and the upcomingProject 007. Square Enix showed theremakes ofFinal Fantasy 7, and EA appeared, committing EA Sports FC and Madden to the platform.
It’s possible that coming off the success of the Switch — a far cry from Nintendo’s grim posture after the Wii U — the gamemaker feels positioned to push into the third-party territory ceded to Sony and Microsoft, the latter of which seems to be clinging to its hardware business by its fingertips. After all, Nintendo has sold over 150 million Switch consoles — more than the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S combined.
It’s also possible a mix of luck and industry trends will once again favor Nintendo. Sony and Microsoft’s reluctance to fully leave the PS4 and Xbox One era behind — coupled with a generation raised on mobile gaming — has trained AAA developers to build for underpowered hardware. TheSwitch 2will still trail behind top-tier machines in horsepower, but that may no longer matter. Most major franchises simply don’t demand cutting-edge specs.
Both of those are likely a piece of the puzzle. But I believe Nintendo’s decision to release amore expensiveand slightly morepowerful devicemay have less to do with past console wars and more to do with its biggest threat in the present. In 2025, Valve’s Steam Deck does what the Switch doesn’t: It lets players enjoy most AAA games anytime, anywhere — and offers many of the same indie titles at steep discounts. (That it also runs emulated games from every Nintendo console ever released surely isn’t lost on the company either, as it continues its crackdown on third-party emulation.)
If Nintendo once again ignores third parties and their graphical needs, it would find itself competing against a growing number of handhelds that offer more power and more games, often with better specs — albeit higher prices.
Inexplicably, Microsoft and Sony burned an entire hardware cycle without answering the Switch’s key selling point: portability. It took a PC gaming marketplace — with almost no hardware pedigree — to offer legitimate competition. And Nintendo, with the Switch 2’s higher price, greater power, and suite of PC-like social features, seems to be taking the threat seriously.
Yes, Nintendo has reentered the modern console wars. Maybe, one day, Sony and Microsoft will too.

"Even with inflation, Switch 2 is one of Nintendo’s priciest consoles ever",2025-04-02T17:13:06Z,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/551545/price-history-comparison-inflation,"It’s-a me, economic anxiety over inflation and US tariffs
byChristopher Grant
January’s Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event took the wraps off the console, but left a lot of details unanswereduntil now. After the initial reveal, I put togetheran analysis of the possible pricingfor the console, using Nintendo’s own historical pricing strategies to guide my thinking. My conclusion then was that it would cost $399.
I…was wrong. The Nintendo Switch 2 will debut in Junestarting at $449.99, with a $499.99 version that includesMario Kart World.
At that price, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be the most expensive console Nintendo has ever released, by some margin. And even adjusted for inflation, and when considering the various bundle packages of previous Nintendo consoles, the Nintendo Switch 2 will still be the most expensive Nintendo console ever made!
It’s not quite June yet, so I can’t update this chart to reflect the inflation-adjusted price to the same date of the Switch 2 launch, but the prices from February of this year are pretty illustrative of the change here.
[Ed. note:An earlier version of this list didn’t include information on pack-in games included in some console releases, and didn’t include the various NES bundles and prices. Adjusted for inflation, only the very first NES release — a tricked-out bundle originally limited to test markets only — would be more expensive than the Nintendo Switch 2. Once you compare it to the more widely released Control Deck release just a few months later, the relative cost of the Nintendo Switch 2 is clear.]
But it wasn’t just me that was wrong! Nearly 57% of ourpoll respondents agreedwith my predicted $399 price, and just 9% thought it would come in at $449. (If that was you, congratulations!) Is that indicative that Nintendo will have a hard time moving units at $449, or simply that people didn’t think Nintendo would go that high? It’s too early to say.
Earlier reporting from Bloomberg, citing multiple industry analysts, pegged the pricebetween $399 and $499, so… nailed it?
On price, the analysts Bloomberg spoke to are unanimous in expecting the Switch 2 to cost at least $399 — which, again, agrees with Polygon’s own analysis. Some think it could go higher, to $449 or even $499, driven by the cost of components and fears over the impact of U.S. tariffs. At $499 it would be the same price as a PlayStation 5 (and $50 more than a digital-only model).
Here again is a list of all of the current-gen consoles, now including the Switch 2 and its confirmed pricing:
At $449, the Switch 2 will go toe to toe on pricing with the all-digital variants of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, which is in keeping with the Switch’s 2017 launch price that matched the $299 being asked for the PS4 Slim and Xbox One S. It’s worth noting, however, that $299 in 2017 dollars still comes in under $400 in today’s bucks, when adjusted for inflation. It’s not just you — everything really is just more expensive!
One last consideration: While the Switch 2’s specs actually put it a notch above the Steam Deck in some key categories, like resolution and including a 4K-compatible dock out of the box, I didn’t expect Valve’s portable gaming PC to beat Nintendo on pricing. The Steam Deck APU is going on three years old at this point, and a little long in the tooth, but it’s hard to argue against the value embedded in Valve’s storefront. (I boughtUndertalefor $1 recently just to have another copy.) So with Valve continuing to make a name for itself, and with Microsoftreportedly entering the portable gaming spacethis year in partnership with Asus, Nintendo no longer has the exclusive lock on the portable gaming market.
Update: I updated the headline and some of the opening paragraphs, along with the first pricing comparison chart, to reflect that when evaluated on a more like-to-like basis the Nintendo Switch 2, with and without a pack-in game, is in fact the most expensive Nintendo console ever released, when adjusted for inflation.

"Game Pass was always good. Now, it’s finally consistent",2025-03-28T18:16:45Z,https://www.polygon.com/opinion/548555/game-pass-value-schedule-original-aa-games,"Rejoice, for it has become a reliable monthly supplier of original AA games
byOli Welsh
The end of 2024 was a huge moment for Microsoft’sGame Passsubscription service. Theday-one arrival ofCall of Duty: Black Ops 6, the biggest possible blockbuster to add, felt like the climactic endpoint of Microsoft’s $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. And it was swiftly followed by another huge Microsoft release: Bethesda’sIndiana Jones and the Great Circle, an improbably great licensed romp starring a genuine pop culture icon.
The early months of 2025 haven’t seen such splashy day-one exclusives on Game Pass, and won’t untilDoom: The Dark Agesarrives on May 15. And yet this period has been just as consequential for Game Pass; it has, if anything, done even more to demonstrate the value of a Game Pass subscription. The service is finally delivering something Microsoft has always intended it would: a steady, reliable stream of brand new games you actually want to play.
It started in January, with the surprise release of theNinja Gaiden 2 Blackremaster, the sleeper fantasy adventureEternal Strands, anddependable Nazi assassination simSniper Elite Resistance. In February, there was Obsidian’sAvowed, perhaps the ultimate Game Pass release — a manageable, moreish, and colorful role-playing game. Now we haveAtomfall, completing an endearingly janky one-two punch from Sniper Elite developer Rebellion. The pace is not about to let up. On April 8, there’s Compulsion Games’South of Midnight. On April 24, the delightfully French turn-based RPGClair Obscur: Expedition 33.
Amongst all these titles there have been a smattering of must-play indie games, likeLonely Mountains: Snow Riders,Citizen Sleeper 2, and the upcomingBlue Prince. There have also been some worthwhile back catalog drops of varying vintage, fromthe firstDiablo, throughWatch Dogs: LegionandWarhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, to the now-ubiquitousBalatro.
These games are all great additions, but they are not the headline. What’s really striking when you look at this release schedule is the steady cadence of brand-new, mid-size, single-player adventures: the kind of game you can gorge yourself on for a couple of weeks and then move on, happy and satiated. From January through toDoom: The Dark Agesin May, Game Pass is serving up at least one of these games every month on day one — and sometimes two or three. It’s also notable that many of them —Eternal Strands,Avowed,Atomfall,South of Midnight,Clair Obscur— are originals. Rejoice, for in the year 2025, Game Pass has become a reliable monthly supplier of a kind of entertainment that was on the verge of extinction: original AA games.
With all those new COD and Indy subscribers hanging around, the timing could not have been better. Game Pass has long represented good value. Microsoft has kept the service’s catalog well stocked since its early days, and simply having access to every first-party game on day one — even before that lineup included Bethesda and Activision Blizzard titles — was always a compelling reason to subscribe. But the rate at which substantial new games would be added to the service was erratic, to say the least. Now, it’s a smooth conveyor belt. That success is just as attributable to smart partnerships with independent studios like Rebellion and smaller publishers likeClair Obscur’s Kepler Interactive as it is to Microsoft’s newfound publishing might.
There are a couple of important caveats to bear in mind. The first is that, since Microsoftrejigged the structure of Game Passlast year, this judgment only really applies to the Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass tiers, where day-one games live. Game Pass Ultimate isn’t cheap, but with EA Play and cloud gaming included, it’s still good value. PC Game Pass is a stone-cold bargain.
The second, much more significant caveat is: I have no idea if any of this is working out financially for Microsoft or for its partners. This has been true since the inception of Game Pass, and even more so since Microsoft stopped reporting subscriber numbers. The cost of rolling up all these day-one games in funding deals, internal licensing, and cannibalization of game sales, must be huge. And that’s before you even factor in the incalculable cost of the acquisition spree that saw Microsoft snap up studios likeAvowed’s Obsidian Entertainment andSouth of Midnight’s Compulsion Games, not to mention the even pricier purchases of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard.
But if there was ever any doubt that Game Pass made sense for gamers — at least, gamers of the kind that like to play through a new single-player adventure every month — that doubt has now been dispelled. Game Pass is not just creating happy customers, it’s making a big contribution to keeping a rickety sector of the industry and artform of video games alive. Here’s hoping this is sustainable, and as good of a deal for the makers of these games as it is for the people playing them.

Elon Musk just got ratioed by the Assassin’s Creed X account,2025-03-26T17:05:07Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/546867/assassins-creed-x-twitter-social-media-bodied-musk-path-of-exile-2-cheating,"Feels good to win one, eh?
byZoë Hannah
Ubisoft’s official X account for the Assassin’s Creed series popped off Tuesday afternoon as the massive franchise responded to offhand criticism from Elon Musk. The reply was a roast for the ages.
The interaction happened when Musk responded to atweet from Mark Kern(@Grummz), a former Blizzard developer who is now more widely known for hissupport of Gamergate. Kern posted a screenshot of a recent ad post frompolitical commentator and streamer Hasan Piker. Thepost, which is tagged as an ad, shows an image of Piker dressed up like a ninja and holding a katana photoshopped onto the cover ofAssassin’s Creed Shadows, which was released March 20 by Ubisoft. “PLAYING @assassinscreed SHADOWS ONCE MORE!! GET IN NOW FOR GAMING!!!” the post reads.
Kern posted the screenshot, taken from a Bluesky account that automatically reposts Piker’s tweets, with his commentary: “You can tell a lot about Ubisoft @Ubisoft with how much money they are throwing at terrorist-platforming streamers.” Musk responded twice: first, “Hasan is a fraud,” then, “‘Sell-out’ would be more accurate. Objectively, he is promoting a terrible game just for the money.”
Cue the legendary response from the official Assassin’s Creed account: “Is that what the guy playing your Path of Exile 2 account told you?”
The account is referencing thewidespread beliefthat Musk’s ostensibly excellent performance in several video games is due to him paying skilled gamers to boost his account while he works on dismantling the U.S. government in the background. This became a rumor after Musk claimed he hasone of the most powerfulPath of Exile 2charactersin the world, thenstreamed himself playing like a noobdespite having god-tier gear that takes hundreds of hours, or superb gameplay, to acquire. Later,YouTuber NikoWrexposted a video that seemingly shows his DMs on X with Elon Musk. The video shows messages from Musk’s account that say the best players in Diablo and Path of Exile games “require multiple people playing the account to win a leveling race.” When NikoWrex asked whether he’s level-boosted inPath of Exile 2orDiablo 4, the Musk account responded with a “100” emoji.
Clearly, the Assassin’s Creed team is not hiding in the shadows like the game’s characters. Kern responded to the fiery takedown — which got about 20 times the number of likes as Musk’s most-liked reply — with a screenshot of aPCGamesN storyreporting onShadows’ sales numbers. (Kern made sure to omit the outlet’s name in his screenshot — another practiceMusk has been bodied for on social media.) “Our game is out,” the Assassin’s Creed X account responded, undoubtedly poking fun atKern for his in-progress, unreleased gamefor which he launched acrowdfunding campaigneight years ago.
The PCGamesN story Kern screenshotted quotes an analyst, Rhys Elliott, who said the early sales numbers “do NOT reflect the smash hit Ubisoft really needs” and posited that the game hasn’t broken even yet. In contrast, Video Games Chronicle reported Monday that the game represents the second-biggest launch in the series and Ubisoft’s best-ever day-one launch on the PlayStation Store, and it garnered a significant amount of PC downloads. The game also got widespread critical acclaim from English-language outlets as well asgaming outlets based in Japan, despite early concerns about the game’s cultural and historical accuracy. That’s not to mention thehandful of X usersclaiming that Ubisoft’s recent social media strategy has tipped them toward buying the game.
The narrative thatShadowsisn’t doing well is one that’s been hard-fought by keyboard warriors who firstcriticized the game’s inclusion of the Black samurai Yasuke. In truth, Ubisoft’s inclusion of Yasuke is either boosting the game up, or not making a difference. The game is getting played a lot, and maybe it’ll get played even more now that Ubi has one-shotted Musk on his own social media platform.

The RTX 5090 is the best and most unnecessary GPU you can buy,2025-03-25T22:01:58Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/545482/rtx-5090-review-nvidia-graphics-card-gpu,"Games run great on it, but the $2,000 price hurts
byTyler Colp
The most powerful graphics card you can buy right now is actually pretty worthless if you don’t have the right PC gaming setup. Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5090 is at its best when paired with a 4K monitor that can reach high refresh rates, like 144 Hz or 240 Hz. Anything less than that diminishes the value of an already ridiculously expensive card.
A graphics card as beefy as the RTX 5090 needs to chew on the toughest games to justify its $1,999 price tag. I’m talking aboutAlan Wake 2with everything set to max, orCyberpunk 2077with all the ray tracing on. It’s a card for people who don’t mind paying to not have to fiddle with graphics settings. Chances are, you already know if that’s you or not.
The RTX 5090 didn’t transform my experience with games — it mostly saved me time. I’ve been using a card sent to me for review by Nvidia, and over the last month I haven’t had to think about frame rate. Even a game asunstable asMonster Hunter Wildsran almost flawlessly on my PC — which is equipped with an Intel Core i9-12900K 5.2 GHz 16-core processor, 32 GB of RAM, and a 1000 W power supply. I’m also running everything on an 4K 32-inch MSI OLED monitor. All the reports of stuttering and abysmal frame rates didn’t affect me. And that’s really the whole reason you’d buy the most expensive graphics card in the world right now: to boot up any game and know it’ll have enough overhead to run just fine.
That doesn’t mean I’d recommend it, though. Even if it were possible tofind one in stock, the RTX 5090 isn’t worth it for almost anyone in need of an upgrade or looking to build a gaming PC. There are far more reasonable options out there, particularly in Nvidia’s previous generations of cards.
That’s largely because you don’t actually need an RTX 5090 to benefit from several of its best features. The 40-series cards can use both DLSS 4 and Frame Generation, which leaves the RTX 5090’s primary advantages in Multi Frame Generation and raw horsepower. In other words: The RTX 5090 is mostly a peek at what future hardware iterations could be capable of at more reasonable prices. It’s proof that Nvidia’s AI-powered upscaling technologies, DLSS and Frame Generation, can get even better than they already were. Both of them really do feel like magic when they work, and they’re only becoming more important as it gets harder and harder to afford the latest hardware.
For example: I cranked up every single setting inCyberpunk 2077as high as it would go. My frame rate chugged as the RTX 5090 churned out scenes with real-time reflections in the puddles and cars whizzing by. But unless I wanted to spend hours people-watching in Night City, the game was unplayably slow. With DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation on, however, it went from a choppy mess in motion to a slightly sluggish but playable game that was hitting upward of 120 frames per second. I could run through the busy market full of NPCs and neon signage without a hitch. If I was willing to put up with a slight delay between my button presses and the actions on screen — similar to how it feels to stream a game over the cloud —Cyberpunk 2077was playable at a high frame rate on settings that were mostly a novelty in the past.
It still wasn’t smooth enough to justify relatively minor improvements in the lighting over less absurd graphics settings. The more you rely on Multi Frame Generation to insert AI-created frames, the more input lag is introduced, meaning your button presses will have a noticeable delay. In situations where you need to drastically increase the frame rate to make the game visually playable, you’ll have to sacrifice responsiveness. And it hurts a fast-paced first-person shooter likeCyberpunk 2077the most. It was certainly impressive seeing the game run well above 60 frames per second on a high-refresh-rate monitor. Normally, that would require a lot of graphical sacrifices to pull off. But just because it was playable doesn’t mean it was tolerable. It’s a feature much better suited for when you’re not aiming for super-high frame rates, which is why I see no reason to invest in an RTX 5090 and an expensive monitor for it. And remember: Nvidia’s other 50-series cards can use Multi Frame Generation too, so the high frame rate life doesn’t require the top-of-the-line GPU.
DLSS 4 is a similar story. This version of the upscaling tech uses a new AI model that basically makes details on objects look a little less blurry, especially in motion. On my 4K monitor, I had to stop and squint inAlan Wake 2andMarvel Rivalsto really notice a difference. Things like raindrops sliding down a window or blades of grass had slightly sharper details in DLSS 4 over DLSS 3, but my frame rates were about the same. These are the kinds of improvements worth waiting 10 minutes to download new drivers that enable it on your 40-series card, rather than spending thousands of dollars on an RTX 5090.
The only tiny caveat to that is Ray Reconstruction, a high-end feature for games with the fanciest ray tracing, which is also known as path tracing. Path tracing makes even the RTX 5090 sweat from all the calculations it has to do to accurately track how light bounces around a scene. Lesser cards can barely handle it. It’s the kind of thing you turn on, admire for 30 seconds, and turn off again to reclaim the chunk of frames it eats up. Ray Reconstruction uses AI-powered denoisers to make the job significantly easier, which causes it to take a much smaller bite out of your frame rate. While you can definitely see and feel the difference in games likeCyberpunk 2077— headlights cast sharper cones of light on the road as you drive — it feels like the first step in making path tracing less of a luxury feature.
DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation overshadow a lot of the raw power of the RTX 5090. Everything fromDiablo 4toAssassin’s Creed Shadowsran exceptionally well on it, easily hitting over 60 fps. That was the same case inAlan Wake 2andMarvel Rivals. Both games gained about 20 to 30 fps over my RTX 4090, and were able to sit comfortably at 60 fps even during intense action. The slight increases weren’t particularly noticeable without staring at the fps counter, though. In practice, all it really meant was that there were fewer times where the frame rate would dip low enough for me to notice it. That kind of overhead is nice to have, especially when you’re trying to hit solid fps at 4K, but it’s not enough to justify hunting an RTX 5090 down and shelling out the money for it, especially when anyone with an RTX 4090 or anRTX 5080will be able to take advantage of DLSS and regular Frame Generation already.
The RTX 5090 is the most powerful GPU right now, but it’s also the most niche GPU right now. It’s not a substantial upgrade from the RTX 4090, nor is it the most cost-effective upgrade for those who have an RTX 30-series or older card. It’s a high-end GPU for people who don’t need a review to tell them whether it’s worth it or not. For everyone else, it’s really just a concept for where graphics tech is headed. Eventually, a much cheaper card with these features will come around. You’re better off acting like it doesn’t exist while you take advantage of all the software improvements Nvidia made along with it.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows has a hidden technique for creating stunningly realistic wind,2025-03-24T20:58:36Z,https://www.polygon.com/news/545610/assassins-creed-shadows-wind-simulation-graphics-technology,"Fluid simulation and ray tracing make it one of the best looking games in a long time
byTyler Colp
When the wind hits inAssassin’s Creed Shadowsthe world feels alive. Leaves whip up into the air, grass dances back and forth, and Naoe’s hair sways from side to side. It’s a stunning effect that enriches the game’s shifting seasonal and weather systems. According to aDigital Foundry interviewwith a few of the game’s rendering engineers, the wind isn’t actually wind at all — it’s invisible fluid.
That’s right: All the realistic wind physics are actually made from a fluid simulation moving through the world. It’s a common technique used in lots of games, and the math has given good effects in games as different asGod of WarandDwarf Fortress.So why not here, too?
The Ubisoft developers callAssassin’s Creed Shadows’dynamic weather system Atmos, and it was created to support its seasonal theme. As Naoe’s revenge story oscillates between two periods of her life, the seasons shift too. You might be trudging through thick blankets of winter snow covering the Japanese countryside for one moment, and then sprinting through verdant fields after it all melts away in the next. Eventually, you can even change the seasons on command.
Combined with its new ray-traced lighting effects,Assassin’s Creed Shadowsmight be one of the best looking games out there. For me, it’s certainly the first time ray tracing has ever felt essential for creating a mood and atmosphere that enriches the storytelling. Digital Foundry’s video has the nitty gritty details, but basically the game injects ray tracing into older technology to more accurately light scenes. Shoji glows while you’re standing inside buildings, and there are darker shadows on objects where the sunlight can’t reach in the open world. With ray tracing off, all the contrast disappears and dulls the world. The experts atDigital Foundrycall the difference a “generational divide in lighting fidelity.”
Assassin’s Creed Shadowsis the kind of game that makes a convincing argument for investing in aPlayStation 5 Proor a gaming PC with a50-series Nvidia graphics card. On the Pro, it can run at a smooth 60 frames per second with ray tracing enabled, and it will fully support Sony’s PSSR upscaling technology in a future update. On PC, DLSS and Frame Generation can easily carry you to 60 fps on an RTX 4070 or newer.
And you’ll benefit from all that horsepower because it’s not just the lighting. It’s how dynamic features like the wind or being able to slice bamboo apart enhance the level of interactivity, or tactile feel of the world — similar to what it’s like playingThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.Asssassin’s Creed Shadowshas set a new bar by using all the power of modern computing not for pure hyper-realism, but for creating a living, breathing world to inhabit.

Is Steam coming to Xbox?,2025-03-21T13:22:24Z,https://www.polygon.com/analysis/544182/steam-xbox-integration,"A leaked image suggests Steam is coming to the Xbox PC app — and maybe consoles, too
byOli Welsh
Microsoft seems intent on tearing down the norms of game-industry competition between platforms. Not content with publishingprecious first-party games on rival consoles, it now looks as though Xbox is ready to link arms with the leading PC gaming platform, Steam.
The Verge reportsthat Microsoft briefly published an image on Thursday depicting a new, cross-device user interface for Xbox. A filter for “Steam” is clearly visible in the view of a user’s game library shown in the image.
The image was published in a blog titled “Opening a Billion Doors with Xbox” about Microsoft’s currentplatform-agnostic strategy. (Sample quote: “Our goal is simple: to make every screen in the world an Xbox.”) The image was apparently quickly removed by Microsoft after The Verge inquired about it.
The publication of the image seems to have been a mistake. Does it really indicate that Steam integration is coming to Xbox? And, in a world where every screen is an Xbox, what does that mean exactly?
It’s certainly not outlandish that Microsoft might seek to make users’ Steam libraries visible within the Xbox PC app in this way. The Verge’s sources said that Microsoft plans to make every game installed on a PC visible within the Xbox app, and other PC game launchers, like GOG, do this.
But there’s also a real chance that Microsoft is thinking of expanding Steam integration beyond desktop PCs. The image shows the new Xbox UI running on multiple devices: a laptop, a phone, a tablet, and an Asus ROG Ally handheld, as well as a TV. Xbox consoles are also pictured. This is consistent with Microsoft’s announced strategy tocombine Windows and Xbox experiencesin a new, unified UI that will reportedly feature on anXbox-branded PC handheld from a partner manufactureras early as this year.
Could Steam integration come to future Xbox consoles as well as desktop and handheld PCs? It’s far from fanciful to suggest it. Xbox chiefPhil Spencer told Polygon last yearthat he thinks console platforms should be more open, like PCs, and that he’s open to putting rival storefronts like the Epic Games Store — or, it follows, Steam — on Xbox consoles.
Windows Centralrefers to persistent rumors of a partnership between Microsoft and Valve to put Steam on the next generation of Xbox consoles — rumors that Polygon has also heard (but not verified). The next-gen Xbox consoles — a dedicated handheld, and a successor to the Xbox Series X — aresaid to be more PC-like devices, running on a Windows-based development environment.
Considering all that, it’s surprisingly easy to picture Steam as an integral part of Xbox in future. This latest image is likely a mock-up, and its publication was surely an unintended slip. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a sign of things to come.

"Half-Life: Alyx, VR’s first — and hopefully not last — killer app, turns 5",2025-03-19T15:21:30Z,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/542162/half-life-alyx-5th-anniversary-vr-pc,"Valve’s masterpiece still carries the platform on its back
byCameron Faulkner

New Half-Life games make me do stupid things. WhenHalf-Life 2came out on PC, I trekked to GameStop to trade in my Xbox, controllers, and games. I had hoped to score hundreds in trade-in credit, but the associate discovered my console was soft-modded and quartered the quote as a result — barely enough to cover the game. It didn’t run very well on my parents’ eMachines desktop (as a console player at the time, I didn’t know what recommended specs were). I was very sad when a port of the game eventually came to Xbox.
Half-Life: Alyxlaunched on March 23, 2020, nearly five years ago. I actually had a solid gaming PC that could run it. However, I didn’t have a VR headset, which is a necessary component. I immediatelyhadto have one, ideally a model that wouldn’t leave a $1,000 crater in my checking account likeValve’s Indexwould. I ended up buying a refurbishedOculus Riftfor $250 or so, and over the course of a memorable week, I beatAlyx, then promptly returned the headset for a refund while my jaw was still on the floor from its incredible finale.
It wasn’t long until I bought the wire-freeQuest 2later in 2020, another questionable financial decision, but I kept this one. Then I replayedAlyxthe way that it was meant to be experienced, which is with roomscale movement — no headset-tracking base stations required. I could kneel down, turn around, and just generally feel like I existed in the world, without concerns of tripping over a cable tethering me to my PC.
These hoops were worth jumping through forHalf-Life: Alyx, and those of you who’ve played it would likely agree. I haven’t played a VR game since with as much graphical polish, as much atmosphere, or as much consideration for different play styles and varying levels of comfort with VR mobility. It’s also the best-paced game I’ve played in VR; it’s the only title I’ve wanted to keep playing beyond my “oh, I don’t feel so good” threshold, which is somewhere around the 30-minute mark.
While the end goal of most of its encounters is to shoot bad guys and creatures with guns,Alyxoffers more open-endedness to encounters and to exploration in general. Once you clear a room, you can practice thwipping and throwing items with your gravity gloves, play the piano, or gawk at the stellar quality of theliquid shaders in bottlesbefore you smash them on the ground. You can open cabinets, fridges, and more, stacking each item you pull out realistically on top of the others. Why you would want to do that is beyond me (also, I did this), but the point is that youcoulddo it.Alyxput you in charge of how you spent your time in VR, not the other way around.
It’s trite to say this five years after launch, butHalf-Life: Alyxfelt like a door being kicked open, revealing what’s possible in VR. And, with the backing of one of gaming’s most beloved developers, I considered its release a possible turning point for VR tech going mainstream. I just really wanted everyone to be able to try it.
VR headset adoption has grown exponentially since 2020, thanks to Meta’s somewhat affordable Quest lineup of headsets. ThePlayStation VR 2can now be used on PCs, no longer exclusively tied to the PlayStation 5 (and it’s $200 less than it was at launch,costing $399.99). But since owning a powerful, costly gaming PC is the other part of the equation, that growth hasn’t made it all that much easier for more players to try games likeHalf-Life: Alyx. I wish Valve would port the game to PS5 so PSVR 2 owners could play it there. But since it hasn’t happened yet, more than two years after the headset’s launch, I’m not holding my breath. Maybe Valve is prepping a version of the game for its oft-rumored wire-free VR headset “Deckard” that our pals atThe Vergehave written about. Or maybe it’s not.
While there have been other great VR-only games sinceAlyx(Horizon Call of the Mountain, Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR, Batman: Arkham Shadow, to name a few that swung for the fences), the virtual reality segment has struggled to keep up the pace with new, must-play games. That’s sad, though it makes me treasureHalf-Life: Alyxeven more. It was a huge gamble to release the long-awaited prequel to one of the most influential games in virtual reality, requiring hardware that very few had then, and still very few have today. To that end, every developer making VR games is knowingly making a huge gamble that may not pan out in their favor.
Sure, I wish thatAlyx’s story could be played directly on consoles and PC so that more fans can play the game, but without gravity gloves, that would spoil all of the fun. When or if that’ll ever happen isn’t for us to decide. So, go ahead, do a stupid thing and buy a VR headset just so you can playHalf-Life: Alyx, even if you return it right after (I won’t tell). The game is just$17.99during the Steam Spring Sale, which lasts until March 20.

Assassin’s Creed Shadowsis launching March 20, and given its whopping 123 GB install size, it’s likely that you’ll need to offload a game or two to make room for it. If you’re hoping to play it on your handheld PC, be it aSteam Deck, anAsus ROG Ally, or something else, perhaps you’re in need of an extra microSD card. If so,Samsung’s 512 GB microSD cardis currently half off at Amazon, costing $37.99.
123 GB sure is a lot of space, butShadowsisn’t even the worst offender when it comes to file sizes.Baldur’s Gate 3requires 150 GB on PC, and recent Call of Duty games approach that, too. 100+ GB installs are becoming the norm in PC games, particularly in open-world games (Grand Theft Auto 6is sure to be humongous in size). So, even if you aren’t jumping into any of the aforementioned games, it’s never a bad idea to snag a microSD card while they’re this cheap because you’ll need the extra storage someday.

"The Samsung 9100 is faster SSD, but its speed isn’t for everyone",2025-03-18T14:02:22Z,https://www.polygon.com/hardware/538861/samsung-9100-pro-pcie5-ssd-speed,"Most devices don’t support PCIe 5.0, narrowing this SSD’s appeal
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
PlayStation 5andPS5 Proowners, as well as most PC users, don’t need to get worked up about PCIe 5.0 SSDs. Sure, they boastmuchfaster advertised speeds than PS5-ready PCIe 4.0 models, which are reasonably affordable these days — 2 TB costs around $150— and come in different storage configurations and styles. But, most mainstream gaming devices and PCs aren’t built to take advantage of PCIe 5.0 speeds. The ones thatarecompatible haven’t given me enough reasons to get jealous … yet.
I say this as someone who has the new Samsung 9100 Pro in-hand (out today), but can’t actually take full advantage of its ludicrous speeds. My newly-rebuilt PC supports PCIe 5.0 SSDs, but there are other bottlenecks in my system (such as the PCIe 3.0 SSDs I use for game installs and the OS) that would provide an imperfect view of the 9100 Pro’s performance. While I love tofind excusesto upgrade my PC, testing videos I’ve seen indicate that the PCIe 5.0 storage isn’t worth overhauling my system for.
As seen from thisvideofrom the YouTube channel Testing Games that shows PC game loading times with PCIe 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 SSDs next to each other, the results aren’t a night-and-day difference in the newer tech’s favor. We’re talking one to three seconds in terms of loading speed, depending on the game (sometimes more, sometimes less). This2024 video from Linus Tech Tipsshows scenarios in which PCIe 5.0 is merely on par with PCIe 4.0 in PCs (and in some rare cases, slightly behind). Regardless, it’s important to note that neither of the testing videos above include Samsung’s new 9100 Pro, so it’s not fair to assume its performance without having put it through its paces. I look forward to seeing if this one changes the narrative.
To put the 9100 Pro’s speed improvements in context, it’s fun to compare it to Samsung’s first PCIe 4.0 SSD,the 980 Pro. Samsung’s new 9110 Pro doubles the 980 Pro’s sequential read speed (14,800 MB/s vs. 7,000 MB/s) and nearly triples its sequential write speed (13,400 MB/s vs. 5,000 MB/s). Sequential gains are nice, but since most workloads (and games) access data randomly, random read /write speeds are more important to consider. Those are improved in the 9100 Pro, too, even when compared to the last-gen 990 Pro. The $219.99 (1 TB with heatsink) starting price makes sense given the speed increases, though it’s astronomical in price compared to the 990 Pro, which currently costs $179.99 at Amazon for the2 TB heatsink model.
It’s unclear as to whether Samsung is done making improved versions of PCIe 4.0-based SSDs, since the990 Pro approached the theoretical speed limit. But if you’re questioning whether you should get a Samsung 990 Pro or any other competing PCIe 4.0 SSD with comparable read / write speeds, I’d suggest following your budget.
If you have a large budget, it’s not completely (only slightly) unreasonable to buy the 9100 Pro if you plan to eventually upgrade to a PCIe 5.0 system down the line. This and all PCIe 5.0 SSDs are backwards compatible in PCIe 4.0 hardware, including the PS5, albeit with slower data transfer speeds than advertised. Therearetangible benefits to having faster storage when it comes to moving data around (assuming your hardware can take full advantage of it), but even so, it doesn’t usually improve gameplay as much as a new graphics card and processor upgrade can. If you play online multiplayer games primarily, those won’t be a great showcase of the 9100 Pro’s prowess as you’ll load into the game at the same speed as everyone else.

"After years in development, D&D’s Unreal-powered virtual tabletop still feels off",2025-03-11T21:54:01Z,https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons/537899/sigil-vtt-review,"Sigil requires a subscription for full access, but it plays more like a pre-alpha mess
bySam Machkovech
Dungeons & Dragons’Sigilplatform, available in full with theMaster Tier subscription to D&D Beyond, would be much easier to recommend if there was an asterisk in the title. The seminal tabletop role-playing game’s firstinternally produced 3D virtual tabletop (VTT) appis finally live, and it offers players and Dungeon Masters alike a lavish workspace to move 3D minis around in an online-connected computer interface. But it has landed without the asterisk that it so very clearly needs, or perhaps another indicator of its incomplete state — words like “alpha,” “beta,” or “early access.” Because if anyone pays for a D&D Beyond subscription expecting a complete or even fully functional experience, they’re going to be sorely disappointed.
At first blush, the app comes off as immediately handsome, with 3D-rendered miniatures, terrain, and lighting all powered byUnreal Engine 5. In motion, it capably evokes scenes fromBaldur’s Gate 3. Its formal ties to D&D Beyond, which include the ability to import characters and content from Wizards of the Coast sourcebooks, shows promise but currently feels unfinished. A spin through the interface’s premade assets includes enough introductory content to excite and tantalize any longtime D&D fan. But dig deeper, and the wheels start to come off.
The bottom line is thatSigilhas arrived somewhat incomplete, and the messaging from the team makes me wonder if it may ever get the additional features it so badly needs. Based on how the app feels as of last month’s launch, I can see a path that leads to that kind of future. But theSigilof today is nowhere near the likes of Yartar yet.
The concept forSigilfirst appeared in the back pages of the 4th editionPlayer’s Handbook, a document published back in 2008. The idea sounds simple: Create a three-dimensional play space where players can aim a camera and move their miniatures to recreate the experience of sitting at a table with friends. But the implementation is incredibly difficult, with reams of rules to mitigate and more edge cases than you can shake an owlbear at.
That’s why over the last 17 years dozens of competing VTTs have sprung up — including some that were, and still are, officially licensed to support the rules and beloved campaigns published for D&D. SoSigilisn’t just competing againstOwlbear Rodeo,Foundry, and other decent alternatives, but against mature platforms that host the same source material, includingRoll20andFantasy Grounds. In fact,Sigilis even competing againsta second internally produced virtual tabletop called Mapsthat got spun up by Wizards in the last few years. But while Maps is actually listed as being in beta, other than not being 3D it still does a fair bit more thanSigildoes today — and that includes when you’ve paid the monthly subscription fee.
In good news for Wizards,Sigil’s biggest differentiator is dramatic: its aesthetics. Every building block fits together to emphasize Unreal’s strengths. The dynamic lighting is absolutely beautiful, especially in terms of how UE5 realistically bounces light sources off of different materials, from cobblestone walls to ornate floor rugs. (Go ahead, move a wall-mounted lantern around to see for yourself; it’s a funSigilparty trick.) Surfaces and props benefit from incredible texture fidelity, so that long glances at any wood plank, mine cart, or spore overgrowth hold up to scrutiny. D&D is a stop-zoom-and-ponder kind of game, andSigilholds its own as a place for players to appreciate between turns.
Sigil’s included building blocks are themed after familiar zones like woodland villages, abandoned cobblestone structures and graveyards, and subterranean dungeons and mines. There’s enough variety in terrains, props, and bespoke items to build a certain kind of campaign, but longtime DMs won’t need long to notice missing biomes and props. As of press time, there’s no way to manually make and insert, say, a wagon or caravan.
If you expected to bring your tiny virtual paintbrush toSigil, take a deep breath; this app isn’t for you
Customization is worse for mini creation: only six species of player characters, only one face for most of these species, and a surprising limit on custom colorization for the scant selection of weapons and armor. If you expected to bring your tiny virtualpaintbrushtoSigil, take a deep breath; this app isn’t for you.
The same goes for anyone who expects to seamlessly plug their sessions into D&D Beyond — the online digital tool set used to create characters and roll dice online.Sigilcurrently doesn’t support everything a player or DM might create or maintain in D&D Beyond — with the exception of character sheets, which I’ll get to. TheSigilsilo does include the latest 5e ruleset refresh, along with every creature in the newestMonster Manual(2025), some as 3D minis, others as 2D tokens.
There are two ways, then, to approachSigilas a sandbox. The first is a fully contained D&D adventure facsimile, in which participants move minis around a 3D space, select actions, aim attacks, roll virtual dice, and let the app automatically manage the resulting math.
The second, which is the only way I’ve enjoyed using Sigil, is one where every connected player keeps character sheets, sourcebooks, and a pad of paper handy, so as to manually track everything that the app fails to do in its current state.
In the latter case,Sigilhas proven to be a fascinating and sometimes capable option for a VTT DMing novice, as far as letting DMs build either flat or multi-story terrain with a simple and mostly easy-to-use interface. Scroll through pre-built pieces, ranging from generic terrain to standard TTRPG objects (traps, barrels, tables) to ornate objects like wells and fortified towers, then move and click them together as you see fit.
This isnotas rich an object-manipulation environment as Unreal’s default creation engine, so it lacks crucial world-building toggles like undoing and mid-creation locking, but it’ll get the job done. What’s more, only one person in your D&D group has to pay a monthly fee to unlockSigilfor group play. (However, everyone will need a gaming-grade PC to useSigilas individual party members, since it’s a demanding, graphically intensive app, not a breezy web-based application.)
Once players join a session, however,Sigilbegins to crumble. Its general management of stats, abilities, and math is too variable and untrustworthy. The simple act of importing a D&D Beyond character leaves a bad first impression, with unclear steps as to how to couple such a character with aSigilmini, along with the glaring issue of various elements often not importing correctly — important stuff like hit points, armor class, or even a character’s full inventory often fail to import correctly, or at all.
These inconsistencies can make combat a bit of a circus. DMs at any time can toggle “encounter mode,” at which point all players and monsters’ initiatives are rolled (including hidden minis), then turn order plays out automatically. This is when players may discover that they can ignore D&D’s inherent limits and house-rule their way to whatever actions they want — which might be fine if DMs had the option to enable or disable such chaos. They can’t, andSigil’s tiny, hard-to-scroll encounter log doesn’t always announce these actions to fellow party members or DMs. (Related: There’s no built-in voice functionality or text chat log. You’ll need to use a third-party chat app.)
In some cases, toggling an attack for either a player or a monster will fail to bring up an expected workflow of aiming the attack, rolling for hit, and damage being calculated. Maybe the aiming reticle never appears. Maybe aiming happens, but nothing is rolled. Or maybe the roll shows numbers that suggest, based on every stat and character sheet loaded intoSigil, that there would be damage, only for no damage to be accounted for. And that’s not even beginning to address the outright missing abilities for various classes — an issue thatSigil’s own release notes address without suggesting that they’ll ever fix it.
What hope is there forSigil? In its current state, all hope lies in ignoring nearly every built-in function and leaving the important accounting to DMs, as ifSigilwere merely a set of building blocks. (Interestingly, this makesSigila solid VTT toolset to experiment with if you’re coming from rulesets likePathfinder, since it still includes TTRPG tropes like built-in virtual dice rolls for all players to see and share.)
Connect with friends onSigilinside of a DM’s custom-built map, and you really do have everything you need to manage shared vision of a 3D, mini-filled space, including a virtual tape measure and “look here” highlights and pings. DMs additionally can establish fog of war and manage the hiding and revealing of any object they see fit (monsters, traps, furniture, whatever).
The most realistic request on my currentSigilwishlist is a premade “favorites” tab for DMs, for the sake of quicker, mid-session improvisation; otherwise, DMs must either pre-place hidden monsters or pick through a massive list of hundreds of tokens and minis.
I’m otherwise spooked bySigil’s unceremonious dumping into the D&D Beyond subscription service in its current state, along with release notes that suggest missing features may never be addressed. OnSigil’s official Discord community, the development team is cataloguing and responding to bug reports and requests, but their current pile of issues seems pretty grand before entertaining notions thatSigilwill ever support third-party content, custom-built 3D assets, or ways for DMs to customize the game’s internal rules and math.
Thanks for the fun set of D&D-themed blocks, Wizards. Until you make it easier for players to click them together in a more automated way, I don’t recommend anyone but the bravest DMs pay for them.

"Sorry We’re Closed is a stylish, sexy survival horror surprise",2025-03-07T22:02:07Z,https://www.polygon.com/impressions/535708/sorry-were-closed-impressions-survival-horror,"This delightful fusion of Silent Hill, Persona, and light-gun shooters is now out on consoles
byMichael McWhertor
I had no idea what I was getting into when I jumped into the world ofSorry We’re Closed, a narrative-driven survival horror adventure that pairs the grime and decay of Silent Hill with the stylish, sexed-up demons of Persona games. But the artists behindSorry We’re Closedhave managed to remix some of my favorite gaming memories into something unique and surprising.
That even includes pairing Resident Evil-style tank controls and fixed camera angles with arcade light-gun shooters. Somehow all of these disparate gameplay influences come together in a nearly magical way.
Sorry We’re Closedfocuses on Michelle, a struggling, heartbroken Londoner who has an unlucky encounter with a sleep-paralysis archdemon known as the Duchess. This experience sends Michelle on a journey of discovery, during which she becomes immersed in a world of angels and demons in conflict; this experience ultimately unlocks magical powers within her. Cursed with mystical vision through a third eye, Michelle can see through the veil of the real world into the demon world and converse with its residents.
The Duchess has pursued Michelle as part of the archdemon’s mission to find love, and she’ll stop at nothing to convince her heartbroken prey to give in to these advances. Rebuffing her archdemon suitor, Michelle works with her friends (some of whom have secretly been demons this whole time) to break free of the Duchess’ curse and chase down the archdemon’s former flames/victims.
Michelle’s Evil Eye vision comes into play both narratively and in gameplay. With the press of a button and a snap of her fingers, Michelle can see other layers of her world, uncovering secret doors, hidden objects, and the corporeal forms of ethereal figures.Sorry We’re Closeduses this vision for environmental puzzles as well; a painting of eyes on a wall in the real world is revealed to be a smart-mouthed eye demon that blocks a pathway, and obstructions like an indestructible metal box can be revealed in the demon world as wooden boxes that can be smashed with an ax.
These Evil Eye powers also factor into combat. In the real world, you’ll face monsters that can be killed with multiple swings of an ax or riddled with bullets. But if Michelle flicks on her Evil Eye, she can see into the hearts of her enemies, attacking their weak point to slay them quickly. Michelle’s otherworldly vision only extends so far, though. There’s a trade-off between fighting enemies inefficiently in the real world at distance and allowing them to get closer so Michelle can kill them quickly but incur more risk in the process.
Combat and movement can be a bit clunky inSorry We’re Closed. While exploration is done in third-person view, combat switches to a sometimes disorienting first-person view. Here, the developers draw influence from light-gun games like Time Crisis or House of the Dead, pushing the player to attack rapidly and chain together combos. Pulling off a series of perfect attacks charges up a weapon called the Heartbreaker, a powerful rifle that deals massive damage to enemy demons.
Combat encounters inSorry We’re Closedclicked with me, but I can see them being a sticking point for some players. Fortunately, failure inSorry We’re Closedis rarely frustrating. The game has a manual save system with frequent save points and generous autosaving. While rationing bullets and health items — water bottles, because it’s important to stay hydrated — is a concern, the game is less punishing than many other survival horror games. (Accessibility options can also make the game much, much easier.)
Beyond combat and exploration of the game’s demonic worlds, Michelle spends a good deal of her time conversing with friends, frenemies, and the angels and demons she can see through her third eye. There’s a rich cast of characters, many of them relatably flawed people trying their best to find love or heal from trauma. These characters (and monsters) are all beautifully realized;Sorry We’re Closedoozes style with its mix of horny, elegant, and wonderfully weird misfits. It’s lovely to see a horror game with bright, flashy pops of color.
Sorry We’re Closedhas been out on PC platforms since November 2024. Developer à la mode games and publisher Akupara Games have since brought the game to consoles (Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X) and upgraded the original release with new features. For survival horror fans looking for a queer-romance-infused spin on retro Resident Evil-style gameplay,Sorry We’re Closedcomes highly recommended. You might just fall in love, which is exactly what the Duchess wants.
Sorry We’re Closedwas released Nov. 14, 2024, on Windows PC and March 6 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

"Wanderstop is so much more than just brewing tea — but that part’s good, too",2025-03-07T22:01:23Z,https://www.polygon.com/review/536249/wanderstop-review-ivy-road-annapurna-tea-shop,"﻿Want some tea?
byNicole Carpenter
A few years ago, a sound bite went viral on TikTok: “Darling, I’ve told you several times before, I have no dream job. I do not dream of labor.”As writer Caitlyn Clark put it in Jacobin at the time, it’s no surprise that the statement resonated with people: a “tighter labor market,” Clark wrote, put increased pressure on workers over the past several years. It’s an increased strain that’s put more and more money in the pockets of the richest among us, yet it hasn’t created better workplaces or a better world for the rest of us. And I’ve been thinking about this phrase — “I do not dream of labor” — as I play developer Ivy Road’sWanderstop. Though the foot on protagonist Alta’s neck is not one of a corporation, but of an individual drive to succeed at all costs — certainly influenced by culture at large — she is ultimately worn down so severely that she can no longer continue. She’s forced to rest, to engage in a less laborious life. But her new life does, indeed, involve labor.
Wanderstopbegins with prolific and successful fighter Alta failing. It’s her first major failure — something she vowed would never happen to her. She had gone to a forest in search of a woman who can train her up, bring her back to her peak form, but the journey didn’t go as planned. Where she lands, instead, is a tea shop. The affable tea shop owner, Boro, plucked her from the forest after she collapsed, no longer able to wield her sword. She doesn’t want to stay, but she also can’t leave: Every time she tries, she collapses. She can’t hold her sword. And so, she does stay. People start to trickle into the tea shop and its surrounding clearing, so she makes them tea.
At this point, Alta probably does dream of labor — the labor of training and fighting for redemption. But over the course of roughly a dozen hours, she begins to let go of that compulsion. Alta trades one type of labor for another: one that’s more caring, slow, and, yes, healing.Wanderstop’s tea shop does not operate for profit. The land around the shop provides everything necessary to make a cup of tea, aside from the tea-making contraption itself. This is whereWanderstoppulls in its cozy gaming elements — the comforting repetition of a farming simulator, with a little twist, is the backbone of its gameplay. Working as Alta, I must plant seeds in specific formations to produce different sorts of plants to harvest both seeds and fruits; the seeds keep the farming running, and the fruits I use to brew tea. I explore the forest for tea leaves, sweep up piles of dead greenery, and snip invasive vines. The tea leaves get dried, and then I can make tea for the different people who pass by.
Each of these people stays briefly at the tea shop, their own stories playing out with every interaction. At first, Alta is desperate for labor — begging people to let her make them tea. But that attitude shifts with each cup of tea she makes as she grapples with her dark past, something she’s long blocked out. Her new form of labor, the act of foraging for ingredients, growing essential fruits, and brewing tea to serve to others, is what’s healing her; she’s engaging in her community in a useful, thoughtful way. Her labor makes a difference not only for herself, but for others, too. Separated from an exploitative system, her work means something more. Beyond the narrative,Wanderstoplargely succeeds at engaging with this ideology through its gameplay. I’m not necessarily rewarded in any way for brewing tea for people in the clearing, other than learning their own stories and preferences. This doesn’t unlock tools to do the job better or faster; I brew tea the same, complicated way each time, using a big ol’ contraption that requires several steps of manual labor.
There’s no real time limit on appeasing these customers; they’ll stay for as long as necessary to get their cup of tea. If you wanted, instead, to brew a dozen cups for yourself or Boro, that’s quite all right. Maybe you’d rather play around with decorations, or test out new combinations of patterns to grow other plants. That’s OK, too. ButWanderstopis a game, and there are still plenty of game-y elements that do detract from its themes. It’s pretty aggressive with its notification icons, for one, so it’s always immediately clear that there’s a new customer to serve or something another wants to tell you. For instance, there’s an early character who’s an eager knight placed under a curse. After one interaction, he sets back out into the forest to complete some task — but in my playthrough, he returned not even a minute later ready to push his own story further, a big yellow exclamation mark over his head as he rushed back toward me. The urgency of these sorts of interactions is entirely at odds with everything else in the game. There’s a meaningful friction in the narrative that makesWanderstopmemorable, but that friction isn’t replicated in the slightest with the gameplay. I can understand why, because adding that friction, be it simply through more time spent waiting or removing notification icons, risks players becoming frustrated and quitting. But it’s a friction that the game could have benefited from to better serveWanderstop’s unique framing.
This all comes back to the idea of dreaming about labor — or not. I don’t dream of labor within the system we live under now, but that doesn’t mean I don’t dream about labor at all. The future I dream of isn’t one without friction, but one that ensures a slower, happier life for my community, even if that means doing the work.Wanderstopfeels the most meaningful when it focuses on that.
Wanderstopwill be released March 11 on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. The game was reviewed on Steam Deck using a pre-release download code provided by Annapurna Interactive.
