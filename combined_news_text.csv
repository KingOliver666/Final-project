"Fortnite OG Season 3 launches today alongside the arrival of assets from The Walking Dead, including Negan's infamous baseball bat.

Chapter 1 Season 3 sees the return of the Lucky Landing POI and a meteor that’s on a “seriously worrying collision course!” Epic Games said. Also from the OG days, the 50v50 LTM returns as OG 50v50.
OG 50v50 pits two 50-player teams against each other, and runs until 9am ET on April 14. Fortnite veterans will remember that 50v50 was the first-ever LTM to be added to Fortnite Battle Royale, all the way back in 2017.
The meteor will emerge in the sky later in OG Chapter 1 Season 3, and get closer and closer as the Season goes on. This, too, will be fondly remembered by Fortnite players who were there to see battle royale kick off back in the day.
Meanwhile, starting today, March 25, anyone can create their own The Walking Dead Universe islands for Fortnite using Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Fortnite Creative.
Creators can start a new project using one of the new The Walking Dead Universe templates to access unique Walking Dead-themed weapons, Prefabs, Galleries, and Walker NPCs. Then, on May 16, developers will be able to publish their The Walking Dead Universe islands via the Creator Portal and make them available for people to play.
Robert Kirkman, creator of The Walking Dead, said: “This collaboration with Fortnite is an incredible opportunity to expand The Walking Dead in ways we’ve never imagined. Whether it’s Lucille smashing through hordes or the eerie presence of Walkers, I can’t wait to see where the Fortnite community’s creativity takes us.”

"In case you missed the news, Bruce Wayne is getting a new look when DC Comicsrelaunches its flagship Batman series this September. Artist Jorge Jiménez has designed a new Batsuit that brings the classic blue cape and cowl back into the spotlight. After almost 90 years on the stands, DC is still tweaking the Dark Knight’s iconic costume.

But how does the new Batsuit measure up to the classics? What are the greatest Batman costumes of all time? We’ve handpicked our 10 favorite Batsuits from the comics, ranging from the original Golden Age costume to more modern reinterpretations like Batman Incorporated and Batman Rebirth. Scroll down to see them all.
And if Batman movies are more your speed, make sure you check outour ranked list of all the movie Batsuits.
1989’s Batman movie introduced a radically different, all-black Batsuit that remains one of the Dark Knight’s most iconic suits in any medium. DC never fully committed to porting that costume over to the comics (outside ofactual Burton-Verse tie-ins like Batman ‘89), but they did introduce a Batsuit inspired by the movies in the 1995 storyline “Troika.”
This new Batsuit adopted the all-black approach to Batman’s body but retained a more traditional blue cape and cowl. It even added more extreme elements like spikes on Batman’s boots, although those elements were toned down after the suit’s initial introduction. Regardless, the result was a more intimidating and stealthy Batsuit that became the default look for the Caped Crusader for the remainder of the ‘90s.
When Bruce Wayne returned following his apparent death in 2008’s Final Crisis, DC celebrated with the launch of a new series, Batman Incorporated, and a new costume designed by David Finch. That Batman Inc. suit is notable both for bringing back the classic yellow oval around the Bat emblem and for ditching the black trunks.
In many ways, the Batman Inc. suit feels like a more successful and visually cohesive version of what DC tried to accomplish with Batman’s New 52 suit a couple of years later. It introduced a more functional quality to Batman’s look, creating the impression that the Batsuit was less spandex than a true suit of armor, yet it avoided mucking up the design with too many stray lines. It also helped create some much-needed visual distinction between Bruce and Dick Grayson, who was also serving as Batman at the time.
The only element that slightly holds back the Batman Inc. look is the slightly goofy-looking armored codpiece. We’re not sure what the thinking was there.
The most recent creation on this list, there’s a reason the Absolute Batman Batsuit makes such a strong first impression. This is Batman at his most imposing.
Absolute Batman takes place in a rebooted DCU where Bruce Wayne lacks many of the advantages of his traditional counterpart, like a mansion and billions of dollars. Still, he manages to create quite an impressive crimefighting arsenal. Nearly every inch of this Batsuit is a weapon, from the razor-sharp ear daggers to the removable Bat emblem that doubles as a battle axe. Even the cape is completely redesigned, consisting of several flexible, arm-like tendrils.
Ultimately, though, it’s the sheer size of this Batman that makes the Absolute suit stand out. Writer Scott Snyder jokingly referred to Absolute Batman as “the Batman who lifts,” and you can see why.
In the alternate timeline of Flashpoint, Joe Chill killed a young Bruce Wayne, leading to a grieving Thomas Wayne becoming Batman instead. This darker, very different Batman needs a darker, very different Batsuit, and he got one in the form of a costume that drops the traditional yellow elements in favor of bold red accents. The Bat emblem, utility belt, and leg holsters are all a deep crimson, creating a unique and cool look. Couple that with the dramatic shoulder spikes on the cape and the fact that this Batman is known to wield guns and a sword, and you have one of the most visually arresting takes on an alternate universe Batman.
Artist Lee Bermejo has drawn and painted Batman a lot over the years, from the Batman/Deathblow crossover to the Joker graphic novel to theinfamous Batman: Damned. In that time, Bermejo has established a distinctive and very striking take on the iconic Batsuit, one unlike any other at DC Comics.
Bermejo’s Batsuit is about as far from the typical spandex look as you can get. This is armor, pure and simple,and the artist’s Batman is as much about function as he is form. But the goal isn’t necessarily realism here. Bermejo’s Batman is also a haunting figure, one mired in dirt and grime and a certain Gothic quality. This Batsuit, as much as any other, inspired the look of Robert Pattinson’s Dark Knight in 2022’s The Batman.
The DC multiverse is a vast place, and we’ve seen countless variations of the Batsuit appear on numerous worlds. That being said, none can truly measure up to Gotham by Gaslight’s Batman. It’s as if the character was made for this steampunk Victorian setting. The Batsuit perfectly translates into this bold revamp that trades skintight spandex for stitched leather and a billowing cloak.
Of course, it helps that the original Gotham by Gaslight series was illustrated by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. Mignola’s Batman is truly iconic, bathed in shadow and looking as if he were chiseled out of raw granite. And even though Mignola’s DC days are long behind him, this incarnation of the character lives on throughfollow-up stories like Gotham by Gaslight: The Kryptonian Age.
It says a lot about the original Bob Kane/Bill Finger-designed Batsuit that the design has survived with only modest changes for the better part of 90 years. All the right ingredients for a truly iconic superhero look were there from the start.
But in addition to serving as the basis for every Batsuit since, the Golden Age design is also notable for boasting some interesting features you don’t normally see elsewhere. The curved ears on Batman’s cowl give him an even more menacing vibe, while the purple gloves add a welcome pop of color. Even the cape is different in a fun way, being more akin to actual bat wings than a traditional superhero cape. It’s always exciting to see modern artists revisit this design.
For the majority of their hugely popular run on DC’s flagship Batman series, Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo focused on the New 52 costume. As we’ve already covered, that suit served as a notable attempt at updating the Caped Crusader’s look with a more modern, tactical bent, but that approach has been done better elsewhere. Case in point, Capullo’s own redesign that debuted just in time for the DC Rebirth relaunch.
Batman’s Rebirth costume is an upgrade on the New 52 suit in pretty much every way. It retains the tactical look while also downplaying some of the extraneous lines and details. It brings some much-needed color back into Batman’s look both with the yellow outline around the Bat emblem and the distinctive purple inner lining of the cape (a throwback to Batman’s Golden Age roots). It’s a bit of a shame that DC phased out this Batsuit after only a couple of years. As far as modern redesigns go, this is the one to beat.
The late ‘60s and ‘70s were a very transformational time for DC’s Batman comics. The books veered away from the camp that defined Batman’s Silver Age adventures and the live-action TV series toward more serious action/adventure and detective stories. Three artists really came to define Batman’s look in this period - Neal Adams, Jim Aparo, and José Luis García-López.
It’s not that these artists dramatically changed the makeup of Batman’s costume. This is the same blue cape and cowl and Bat emblem with yellow oval that was popularized by the TV series. But what unites Adams, Aparo, and Garcia-López’s work is the physicality they brought to the character. Gone was the burly brawler of the Silver Age, replaced by a leaner and more lithe Batman. Batman is basically a ninja superhero, so it makes sense that he be built more like a gymnast than a bodybuilder.
For many fans, this is still the standard by which all other Batman costumes are judged. That’s especially thanks to Garcia-López, whose art has adorned bedsheets, lunchboxes, T-shirts, and countless other Batman merch over the years.
Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee’s Hush storyline is often regarded as the start of the modern era of Batman comics. That’s thanks to Lee’s instantly iconic redesign of the Batsuit as much as anything else.
With the Hush costume, Lee brought a new level of elegant simplicity to the Batsuit. Gone is the yellow oval that persisted for decades, to be replaced by a sleek, black emblem. Lee’s knack for rendering dynamic, detailed, and very powerful superhero physiques is on full display in his Batman. Readers needed to believe that this Dark Knight could face down a gauntlet of his greatest foes – and Superman for good measure, and they certainly did.
The Hush redesign immediately became the default look for Batman going forward. Lee created a clear model that subsequent artists like Andy Kubert and Tony Daniel followed closely. While individual artists varied in whether they chose the blue or black cape and cowl, the rest of the details remained consistent. It’s telling that, after a period of focusing on more armored Batman costumes in the New 52 and DC Rebirth eras, DC eventually threw in the towel and went back to the Hush costume. It just plain works.
Artist Jorge Jiménez is no stranger to Batman at this point, but he’ll be debuting a new Batsuit when he and writer Matt Fractionkick off DC’s relaunched Batman series in September 2025.
The newest Batsuit isn’t a massive deviation from the now-standard Hush costume, though it does have a few interesting embellishments all its own. Where most artists in recent years have gravitated toward the black cape and cowl, Jiménez is bringing back the blue. Not only that, the cape is now heavily shaded, creating a stark contrast between the inner and older folds and bringing to mind Bruce Timm’s Batman: The Animated Series look. Even the Bat emblem is blue now, as well as sporting a bigger and more angular shape.
After all this time, it’s great to see Batman still trying out new looks. But will the latest redesign have the staying power of Batman’s most iconic suits? Only time will tell.

"Robert Kirkman’s ultra-violent superhero comic book series published by Image Comics is as popular as ever. You have Amazon Prime’s adult animation adaptation of the series, which has justwrapped up its third season, with afourth on the way. Then there’s Mortal Kombat 1,where Omni-Man is playableand fits in perfectly with the violent and gruesome universe we’ve come to know and love.

But if you’re looking for the right place to immerse yourself in the source material, we've got you covered. Reading comics online has never been easier, and we’re here to show you the best ways to do so with Invincible.
If you’re on the fence on starting Invincible (why would you be? It’s amazing), then you can go directly to the Image Comics website to read the first issue absolutely free, no strings attached. This is a great way to see if the story is something that you may be interested in reading long term.
Once you’re ready to start reading the full series on the go, you can sign up for a handful of different digital comics services. You can read all of the Invincible compendiums (larger single-issue collections covering certain arcs) onHoopla. This is a greatfree service for borrowing digital comicsand books, just like the library. The catch - when you make your account, Hoopla looks for libraries in your area and, if that library doesn’t have Invincible available, you aren’t able to “check out” with it. Luckily, this is one of the most popular comic series around, so we’d be shocked if this happened. Link your library card and there you have it, the entirety of Invincible at the press of a button.
The upside to buying Invincible on the Kindle app versus checking it out of a virtual library is that you don’t have to worry about having limited time with it. The Invincible compendiums are hundreds of pages each, and while it’s inherently faster to read comics compared to a traditional book, that time really adds up. So purchasing is a better option for longevity’s sake. Additionally, the digital versions will typically save you a few bucks compared to physical.
If you’re like me and you prefer that tactile feel of flipping through the pages and displaying a nice shiny spine on your shelf, all three Invincible compendiums are also all available in trade paperback and hardcover versions. The trade paperbacks are each tend to go on sale off and on at Amazon right now, so now’s the perfect time to bolster your bookshelf collection. There are also the supplemental stories Invincible Universe you can expand to, which reveal the histories of many of Invincible’s most popular characters.

"Greg Rucka and Michael Lark's Lazarus (not to be confused withthe upcoming Shinichirō Watanabe anime Lazarus) has consistently been one of the best books being published by Image Comics in recent years. Now fans are in for some bittersweet news, as Image has announced the series will be reaching its conclusion with Lazarus: Fallen.

IGN can exclusively debut the first preview art for Lazarus: Fallen #1. Get a closer look in the slideshow gallery below:
Rucka, Lark, and Arcas are returning to the Lazarus series with this final volume, and are joined by letterer Ariana Maher, editor Alejandro Arbona, and graphic designers Eric Trautmann and Richard Howe.
For those not familiar with the series, Lazarus is set in a futuristic dystopia where the world has slid back into feudalism. The world is ruled by a handful of powerful Families, and the genetically engineered super-soldier Forever Carlyle is the top enforcer for the Carlyle Family. But now Forever has finally broken free of her father's control, and she means to bring the entire system crashing down.
“Michael and I started Lazarus back in 2013, and while we knew we were telling a story that was a distorted reflection of our world, I don’t think either of us imagined how less distorted that vision would become,” said Rucka in Image's press release. “But for all the talk about the world-building, about the vision of the future—or arguably, prescience of the present—Lazarus has remained, at its heart, about Forever’s journey. We’re finally getting to the resolution of it—the ending that we’ve been working on from the start. There’s so much I’m excited about sharing with this final run. There are things that I think will surprise some readers—some twists that they, perhaps, didn’t see coming. I know that it’s been a long wait for these final issues, and I’m grateful for the patience our audience has shown. We’ve got the most amazing fans, and that is both humbling and gratifying.”
""I'm very happy to get Lazarus back into readers' hands,"" said Lark. ""Greg has given me so much to explore with the characters and storytelling, and I'm really excited about the work I've been doing on the new issues. I think it is some of the best work I've ever done, and I hope readers feel the same.""
Rucka added, “I love working with Michael. He fits my sensibilities for storytelling so effortlessly, and his character work is never anything less than superb. He always delivers on the action, but it’s in the quiet scenes, in the emotional beats, that I think he shines brightest—and it’s in those moments that the series lives and breathes. This is unquestionably the best work of Michael’s career thus far, and that is genuinely saying something.”
Lazarus: Fallen #1 will be released on June 25, 2025.

"As announced by Sony Pictures at CinemaCon 2025, the fourth MCU Spider-Man film will officially be titledSpider-Man: Brand New Day. The latest adventure for Tom Holland’s Peter Parker is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton of Shang-Chi fame, and swings into theaters on July 31, 2026. Anticipation for this new film is at a fever pitch, especially since Spider-Man: No Way Home was a smash hit withcriticsandaudiences. No new details were given about the film at Sony’s panel, but the title gives us plenty to chew on since, unlike the previous MCU Spider-Man film titles, this one is a direct reference to a story from the comics.

Brand New Day is one of the more famous Spider-Man stories because of its connection to the notorious One More Day storyline, and the use of this title may give big hints for Spider-Man’s future in the MCU. Let’s take a look at what Brand New Day may mean for Peter Parker’s upcoming film.
To properly explain Brand New Day, we first have to go over the events that led into it. During the Civil War crossover event, Peter Parker shocked everyone by revealing his secret identity to the world. He did this because he was part of Iron Man’s pro-registration side of the war, which required superheroes to register their identities with the government. However, the reveal of Peter’s identity led the Kingpin to order his assassination, only for the shooter to miss Peter and hit Aunt May instead. With May in the hospital, Peter looks for any help he can get to save her… which he receives in the form of Mephisto, who offers to save May’s life in exchange for undoing his marriage to Mary Jane.
To say that this story was controversial would be a severe understatement. Spider-Man making a deal with the Devil out of editorial mandate is well known as one of the most hated comic stories of all time. But what’s done is done, and that led to Brand New Day, starting with Amazing Spider-Man #546.
Brand New Day was a reset of Spidey’s status quo, and is less of an individual story in its own right than a branding exercise over a series of smaller arcs that ran all the way until Amazing #564. The overall story is about establishing what’s happened to the timeline after the Mephisto deal takes place, with the big ticket items including the world forgetting Spider-Man’s secret identity, Peter and Mary Jane having never been married, and the return of Harry Osborn. (He’d been dead for a while. Oh, and this one turned out to be a clone.)
Peter and MJ’s history was altered so they’d only been in a long-term relationship that was already over. New supporting cast and villains were introduced during this period, such as forensic scientist and future Spidey love interest Carlie Cooper, police officer Vincent Gonzalez, redheaded superhero Jackpot, Martin Li aka Mr. Negative, the Goblin-esque villain Menace (later revealed to be Harry Osborn love interest Lily Hollister), and the bane of every Insomniac Spider-Man player’s existence, Screwball. Brand New Day tried to rejuvenate the Spider-Man franchise by relaunching it, and although fan reception wasmixedto say the least, the era was a pivotal moment in the history of Spider-Man comics.
If you remember the plot of Spider-Man: No Way Home, you may recognize that some elements of that film already resemble aspects of One More Day and Brand New Day. Doctor Strange’s spell that Peter botches was supposed to erase the world’s knowledge of his secret identity, and in the end Strange needs to cast a new spell that results in everyone in the world forgetting who Peter is. This includes his love interest Michelle “MJ” Jones and best pal Ned Leeds, as well as all of Peter’s superhero friends. Peter receiving supernatural interference that results in the world forgetting that he’s Spider-Man and removing the Peter/MJ romance from the equation means that No Way Home is now effectively a loose adaptation of One More Day.
With Brand New Day starting a new era for Tom Holland’s Spidey franchise, we might now have some clues as to what characters will be included. Peter ran into Willem Dafoe’s Green Goblin in No Way Home via the power of the multiverse, but could the MCU’s take on the Osborns finally make their debut? Harry being Peter’s new bestie would make a lot of sense with Ned no longer knowing him. As well, Stranger Things alum Sadie Sink hasalready been cast, with the twobiggest theoriesas to her role being either an officially named Mary Jane Watson or longtime X-Men member Jean Grey. However, now that we know the title is Brand New Day, an outside the box choice could be her playing Carlie Cooper as a new love interest for Peter.
As for bad guys, could Mr. Negative be in the running for Spidey’s new nemesis? Fans of the comics and the Insomniac Spider-Man games know that Martin Li is associated with charity organization F.E.A.S.T. (Food, Emergency Aid, Shelter and Training), which actually made a blink and you’ll miss it cameo in No Way Home as the place where Aunt May works. The Darkforce wielding crime lord and his gang the Inner Demons are some of the most prominent Spider-Man foes to never appear in a live-action film. We doubt that Lily Hollister/Menace will be the new villain, but she could still appear in some capacity if the film decides to lay groundwork for the MCU’s Osborns.
Of course, we can’t discount the possibility that the movie is only using the title Brand New Day and will chart its own course. The MCU has a history of doing that, with films like Age of Ultron and Infinity War not having much at all to do with their comic counterparts. Perhaps Brand New Day is merely a signifier that this is a new direction for the Spider-Man franchise after the Home trilogy.
It is also entirely possible that Brand New Day will avoid these newer characters and undo the spell cast at the end of No Way Home, allowing Peter’s old friends to return to the series. However, that would be a missed opportunity to not use No Way Home’s ending to tell a more grounded, street level Spider-Man story. Although with Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars on the way, we’d be surprised if Peter doesn’t wind up in some more multiversal mischief sooner or later. We’ll all find out when the film arrives next July.

"This article contains spoilers for theInvincibleSeason 3 finale.

After eight episodes featuringhugecharacter deaths, multiple Invincibles (Steven Yeun), and so, so much blood and guts, Invincible Season 3 is in the books. Unlike Season 2, which ended with a relatively quieter tag for the finale, Season 3 not only teed up atonof storylines for the already-in-production Season 4… It also included a mid-credits scene that sets up a storyline Invincible co-creator Robert Kirkman never got to do in the comic books.
Before we get to that closing montage – and mid-credits scene – a bit of explanation about the finale itself. It’s for the most part one, long fight scene as Invincible, Oliver (Christian Convery) and Atom Eve (Gillian Jacobs) take on the vicious Viltrumite warrior Conquest (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Conquest is ostensibly on Earth to prepare the world for Viltrumite, er, conquest, but as he explains repeatedly to Invincible, he really loves destroying and torturing things.
After Conquest seemingly kills Eve, Invincible, who has had both hands broken, absolutely loses it and bashes Conquest to “death” with his own head. Some might say this is sweet, sweet vengeance for Negan (also Morgan) famously bashing Glenn Rhee’s (also Yeun) head in on The Walking Dead, but it comes straight from the Invincible comics, which came out in 2009. So incredibly satisfying to watch if you want #Justice4Glenn, but also mostly just a nice coincidence.
In any case, Eve isnotdead and reveals – as fans who watched the Atom Eve Special learned – that when she’s put in moments of extreme stress, she’s able to get past the mental blocks that otherwise stop her from transmuting living matter, instead of just inert materials. However, eagle-eyed fans will also note that when she transmutes Invincible’s costume later in the scene when they’re about to have sex, it’s made of plants… So she may have broken through these blocks in a bigger way than she realizes.
The final conclusion of the episode, and the arc of the season, is that Invincible visits his half-brother Oliver in a hospital bed. And while Oliver thinks Invincible is going to tell him that killing is wrong… Invincible has decided that if anyone threatens his family again, just as Angstrom Levy (Sterling K. Brown) did in the previous episode, and Conquest this week, he won’t hesitate to kill them.
It’s a surprising move from the show, though again one pulled directly from the comic books, almost word for word. While the large majority of superhero media, from TV shows to movies, to the original comics wrestle with the “should heroes kill?” debate, Invincible has firmly fallen on the side of “yeah, when necessary.” Still, an ominous musical sting played under Invincible’s pro-death penalty statement points to more challenges coming the way of his realigned moral compass. So expect that this debate might not be as open and shut as the finale indicates.
Beyond that, the real eyebrow-raising moments are saved for that montage. So let’s break those Season 4 teases down, one by one.
Last seen in Season 2, Episode 6 “It’s Not That Simple,” the Sequids are incredibly dangerous Martian brain slugs who almost beat the Guardians of the Globe in their last encounter, including Invincible and Atom Eve. They had taken over the brain of an astronaut named Rus Livingston (Ben Schwartz), who was finally freed and brought back to Earth after a horrifying, harrowing ordeal. Unfortunately for Rus, after he returned to his apartment, which had been trashed by Shapesmith (also Schwartz), he threw up a Sequid in the sink – which immediately took over his body, again.
That plotline has been on hold since the aforementioned episode, but looks like it’s coming back in a big way in Season 4. While everything else has been going on this season, the Sequids have been steadily building an army in the sewers, including what looks like hundreds of human workers and others. Given we were told that if the Sequids ever made it to Earth it was game over for humanity… Yeah, that’s bad! “Not long now,” says Russequid. Uh-oh!
At the end of Season 3, Episode 4, “You Were My Hero,” the unstoppable Battle Beast was fighting a Viltrumite in the cold, dark reaches of space. We catch up to him here, as well as the scattered remains of the Viltrumite… BB is in suspended animation but is quickly picked up by an alien ship. And a few seconds after that, he wakes up, ready for battle. He wants “more!”
If things pan out on the TV show the same way they do in the comic, the ship was part of the Coalition of Planets, the group fighting back against the Viltrumites. Alongside Allen the Alien (Seth Rogen) and Nolan Grayson (J.K. Simmons), it looks like the Coalition finally has a fighting chance against the unstoppable aliens.
In one of the best casting coups on the show, the creepy, Cenobite-esque Technicians who fixed up Angstrom Levy, as first seen in Season 3, Episode 7, are voiced by Doug Bradley. You might know him better as Pinhead from the Hellraiser series. And in this teaser of coming attractions, we get to hear Bradley say somethingextremelyPinhead.
After revealing that Angstrom has a new arm thanks to them (Invincible accidentally amputated it last episode), Angstrom asks what they want in return. “Angstrom Levy, you have witnessed what our ambitions have done to our world, and what we have had to do to ourselves to survive here,” a Technician explains.
Angstrom thinks they want a new home, but the Technicians have other ideas. “That is only the beginning of the delights we will achieve together,” the Technician says. Now, the classic Hellraiser line is “We have such sights to show you” while the 2022 remake employed “greater delights await.” But come on, if you weren’t Leo Dicaprio pointing at the screen meme at that line, what are we even doing here?
In any case, to explain what the Technicians are up to is to spoil one of the great plot twists of the Invincible comics. Suffice it to say that they will tie into the action, and we have not seen the last of either Angstrom or the not-Cenobites.
Despite Invincible demanding Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins) show him Conquest’s dead body, it turns out that the dead body was a fake. In fact, Cecil has Conquest locked in a massive, underground chamber as the Viltrumite’s body reconstitutes itself.
Donald (Chris Diamantopoulos), Cecil’s right-hand man, protests that this is a mistake. And if you’ve read the comics, you know that Donald is correct: you cannot hold a massively powered Viltrumite like Conquest with mere Earth materials, no matter how secure Cecil makes the facility. Unfortunately for Cecil, as well as the world, in this case, Invincible was correct: Conquest should have been killed.
That brings us to the mid-credits scene. While everything else we’ve explained above happens in the comic books by Kirkman, Ryan Ottley, and Cory Walker, this scene is completely new. And in fact, it’s something Kirkman always wanted to do in the comics, but never found room for. Oh, and there’s a fantastic, surprise voice actor involved.
Right after the end credits begin, we cut to Damien Darkblood (Clancy Brown), the demon detective we haven’t seen since Season 1, Episode 4, “Neil Armstrong, Eat Your Heart Out.” In case you forgot – it aired back in 2021, after all – Damien was investigating Omni-Man, then set up by Cecil and sent back to Hell. As he was sucked down to the inferno, he threatened vengeance on Cecil… And that’s (potentially) what we’re seeing here.
Now missing his trenchcoat, Damien creates a summoning circle, which calls a demon lord voiced by none other than Bruce Campbell. And Damien hails to the king, baby, by bringing “the great beast… welcome news.” Damien explains that he has the means to restore the demon to his former glory, and the “infernal throne.” The key? A “surface dweller of great power, likes of which this planet has not seen for eons.” And furthermore, Damien explains that “his blackened heart will be bound to your service.” And how will they do that? By conjuring “him” to Hell.
In the comics, Damien Darkblood was even more of a blink-and-you-miss-him character than he was on the TV show. But as Kirkman explained to theCartoonist Kayfabe podcastin 2020, there was originally more planned.
“The thing that I really regret is I never had an adventure where the superheroes went into Hell,” Kirkman explained. “There’s been so many superhero comics where it’s like, they got to go fight Mephisto or something, and I was like, ah jeez, I never got around to that. And the Damien Darkblood character was there so I could eventually do a story like that, and I never got around to it.”
Part of the reason for this may be that the initial storyline and reveal of Omni-Man as a bad guy was supposed to go nearly double the length that it did in the comic. It ultimately came to a head in issues 12 and 13, versus the planned 25. That meant there just wasn’t as much room for Darkblood to be investigating Omni-Man, because… Well, there was nothing left to investigate. So credit to Kirkman and company for letting that planned story play out on the TV show in a way we never saw in the books.
The big question here is: who is Damien Darkblood referring to? Is it Invincible? Omni-Man? Cecil? We’ll know more when Season 4 of Invincible premieres on Prime Video."
"Havingfundamentally transformed the X-Men franchiseand debuteda brand new incarnation of the Ultimate Universe, writer Jonathan Hickman is gearing up for his next great Marvel epic. Today Marvel Comics revealed new details about Imperial, a four-issue event series that promises to reshape the fabric of the wider Marvel Universe.

Similar to how 2023's Ultimate Invasion paved the way for the ongoing Ultimate Universe line, Imperial is designed to shake up the status quo for Marvel's cosmic characters and lay the foundation for a new line of comics. In this series, many of the traditional power players in the Marvel Universe will be destroyed or overthrown, leaving room for new empires to rise in their place. The series will specifically center around the Hulk family, Black Panther, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Nova Corps, and other cosmic kings and queens.
Imperial will be written by Hickman and drawn by Federico Vicentini (Miles Morales: Spider-Man) and Iban Coello (Venom). Hickman's Ultimate Spider-Man collaborator Marco Checchetto is drawing the covers for the series.
""I'm very excited about this project as I’m obviously a huge fan of all things Marvel Cosmic,"" Hickman said in a statement. ""The goal here is to kind of do what we did with the recent Ultimate line for all of our space titles, except having the setup book (Imperial) be more of an event than a world-building exercise (like Ultimate Invasion). The art team is killing it, and we’re all just very excited for what’s happening in this special corner of the Marvel Universe.""
Based on the cover and concept art revealed so far, we can infer certain things about the big changes coming in Imperial. It seems the Nova Corps will be decimated (again), while Star-Lord looks to play a central role in the conflict. It also appears that an entire family of Hulks will take control of the bloody world of Sakaar. And given Black Panther's presence in the story, it's a safe bet that the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda has a part to play in this conflict.
Imperial #1 will be released on June 4, 2025. Let us know your theories about the book in the comments below.
In other upcoming Marvel news, we're gettinga new Thunderbolts team that includes Wolverine, Hulk, and Carnage, and we gotan exclusive look at Daredevil: Cold Day in Hell.

"Clover Press has been busy publishing a number of Marvel art books focused on acclaimed artists like Alex Maleev and Russell Dauterman, but now they're making the jump over to DC. The publisher's first DC artbook is The DC Art of Jorge Jiménez, celebrating the prolific artist behind Batman, Superman, Super Sons, and more.

Withthe Kickstarter campaign for The DC Art of Jorge Jiménezlive now, IGN can exclusively debut a new preview of the book. Check out the slideshow gallery below to see some truly stunning art from Jiménez's ongoing Batman run:
The DC Art of Jorge Jiménez is a hardcover art book featuring a curated lineup of cover art and interior work from Jiménez's prolific DC career.
“Since the Superman movie with its masterful soundtrack first caught my attention when I was a kid, I’ve been a die-hard fan of the DC Comics universe,” said Jiménez in a statement. “My first drawings were destined to be Batman or Superman. Being able to fulfill my dream of working with these characters and making this my job is priceless. It's been more than ten years living these adventures every day, working side by side with great writers like James Tynion, Chip Zdarsky, Scott Snyder and Peter Tomasi from whom I have learned so much, taking inspiration from my fellow artists who, always accompanied by the great editors at DC.”
“It is a great honor for me to have an art book featuring my work, which compiles so many hours and days of my life from my first steps in digital series, to my jump to the front line of DC, with everything that entails; high quality inked pages, covers, and previously unpublished concept art,” said Jiménez. “I'm super excited about all this. Will you join me on this journey along with Batman, Harley Quinn, Wonder Woman, Superman and all these incredible characters?! You can't miss it!”
The DC Art of Jorge Jiménez islive on Kickstarter now.
Jiménez's five-year Batman run is showing no sign of ending anytime soon. We recently learned that Jiménez will return to the series after Batman: Hush 2 wraps up this fall. This time, Jiménez is teaming with writer Matt Fraction fora relaunched series that introduces a new Batsuit.

"Warning:this article contains spoilers for Daredevil: Born Again Episode 6.

Daredevil: Born Again Season 1 may feature some familiar MCU villains in Vincent D’Onofrio’s Wilson Fisk and Wilson Bethel’s Bullseye, but it also introduces a brand new threat in the form ofthe artistically inclined serial killer Muse. Muse’s murals have been appearing all over the city, and now we know the full, gruesome story behind their creation.
Visually and in terms of his modus operandi, Muse is pulled directly from the pages of Marvel’s Daredevil comics. But in other ways, the character has been streamlined and altered for his live-action debut. Frankly, we think he’s all the better for it. Here’s why Born Again has been smart in its adaptation of this more recent addition to Daredevil’s rogues gallery.
Again, the new series sticks pretty close to the source material where Muse’s artistic sensibilities lie. He’s a street artist with a particular fascination with New York’s vigilantes. He paints tributes to these figures using human blood as a key ingredient. Though the comic book version of Muse goes a step further with his grisly brand of artistic expression, eventually arranging dead bodies to form sculptures. He’s a villain who wouldn’t be out of place in the Hannibal TV series.
In other ways, however, The MCU’s Muse is quite a bit different from the comic. There’s his apparent lack of powers, for one thing. In the comics, Muse is more than a match for Daredevil and his heightened senses. His body acts as a sort of sensory void that confounds Matt’s senses. He also has superhuman strength and agility for good measure.
In the show, it doesn’t appear that Muse has any powers to speak of. He’s just a guy who really enjoys treating innocent passersby as blood bags and has some passable martial arts skills. But that’s a good thing. Muse really doesn’t need powers to serve as a proper foil to Matt Murdock. Like its predecessor, Born Again exists in a more grounded corner of the MCU. Daredevil, for all his enhanced senses and ninja training, is a guy who emerges from many battles bruised, battered, and thoroughly winded. As long as Muse is presented as a guy who can put up a decent fight, he really doesn’t need superhuman strength to make the stakes feel clear and real.
Plus, the idea that Muse’s body is a sensory vortex was always a bit silly. It’s too on the nose, even for the Marvel Universe. He becomes a character who exists solely to vex Daredevil rather than on his own terms.
The other big difference with Born Again’s Muse is that there’s no sidekick stuck in the middle of the Daredevil/Muse rivalry. At the time Muse was introduced in 2016, Matt was mentoring a hero named Blindspot. It’s Blindspot who wound up suffering the most at Muse’s hands, losing his eyes to the sadistic villain and having to learn how to operate without the benefit of sight.
Here again, the show succeeds in streamlining and simplifying that dynamic so that the focus remains squarely on Daredevil, Fisk, and Muse. By now it’s become apparent that Muse isn’t really the endgame villain of the series, but rather a secondary antagonist meant to test the former two characters. Muse’s blood-soaked artistic campaign puts Fisk’s newfound political career at risk, pushing him closer to outright authoritarianism. In Episode 6, Muse becomes the catalyst that finally compels Matt to throw caution to the wind and become Daredevil again. Having a character like Blindspot in this mix would only serve to needlessly complicate matters.
Muse may not be the central villain of Born Again, but he is an important player who further illustrates the struggle Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk both face in trying to reinvent themselves. The series wisely ignores the comic book elements that don’t really matter to the story being told. But there is one more potential change to Muse that Born Again looks poised to explore in the episodes to come. Who exactly is under that mask?
The Daredevil comics never really get into the question of who Muse is when he’s not dressed in costume and draining human blood to make art. He’s depicted as an Inhuman (the same species as Anson Mount’s Black Bolt and the other characters fromthe much-reviled Marvel’s Inhumans series). That eliminates the need for the character to have any sort of civilian identity or private life. But in the show, there’s no reason to assume Muse is an Inhuman or anything other than a truly messed-up artistic savant.
But that does raise an interesting question. If Muse is an ordinary man, who is he? Making matters more interesting is the fact that we still don’t know which actor is playing Muse. Marvel has kept mum on that detail, which all but confirms that Muse is secretly someone else we’ve already met in the show.
Who could it be under that mask? There are all sorts of intriguing theories. Maybe Bethel’s Bullseye has somehow escaped from prison and taken on a new costumed identity. Maybe Arty Froushan’s Buck Cashman is up to some unsavory business when not serving as Fisk’s right hand. Maybe Michael Gandolfini’s Daniel Blake is more demented than we gave him credit for (though Blake doesn’t seem to have the right build).
There are even more outlandish possibilities. With allthe rampant speculation that Elden Henson’s Foggy Nelson faked his death, maybe we’ll find out it’s Foggy under the mask. Hey, there has to be some reason thatHenson is coming back for Season 2.
Whatever the truth here, it seems safe to assume that there’s a big reveal coming as far as Muse’s true identity. And whomever ultimately emerges as the culprit behind Muse’s horrific work, that reveal may serve as the biggest deviation from the comics. As much as the series has succeeded in simplifying and streamlining Muse, it’s also managing to add something new and exciting to the character.

"One of the most fun things about movie-making is remembering all of those little things that almost were and could have been. So many things change in pre-production, post-production, and even the actual production itself — and forCaptain America: Brave New World, one of those things was the role Giancarlo Esposito was going to play.

Esposito ultimately played Sidewinder in the film, but was originally approached to play King Cobra. The Breaking Bad legend revealed toEmpirein a recent interview (via Collider) that producer Nate Moore hadoriginally asked him to portray Klaus Voorhees’ alter ego.
""If I'm walking around the neighborhood, African-Americans go, 'What's up, King?' I love it. They call me King, baby! I mean, that's the highest honor,"" Esposito recalled thinking in those early days. ""But as it turned out, there [are other Kings] in the Marvel world, and this was connected to the Serpent Society — they were going back to the comics and trying to figure it out, and Nate said, 'We can give you all the characteristics of King, but we think he should be Sidewinder.' ""
Voorhees appears in the Captain America comics as a former convict who has to contend with a radioactive snake bite after his murder plot to axe colleague Professor Ezekiel Schektor doesn’t quite go as planned, hence the name King Cobra. In his time on the page, he has battled the likes of Mr. Fantastic, Thor, and Daredevil, as well as Cap and Falcon.
That said,the creatives behind Brave New Worldultimately had Esposito play Sidewinder, aka Seth Voelker, an economics professor who gets chemically mutated by the Roxxon Oil Company and becomes a crime boss and the leader of Serpent. Over the years, he’s had major face-offs with Scarlet Witch, The Thing, Triton, and Stingray — but now he’s having one with Cap himself.
""They spoke about creating a character that was really grounded, in a mercenary fashion,” Esposito added, noting that the character was shaped inthe film's robust reshoots. “They wanted to ground the movie when they went back in to do some additional shooting, and their focus now was on this additional character. So it was a bit of a whirlwind for me. I focused myself and I went in there and knocked it out.""
As for the character’s future in the MCU, it seems at least Esposito wants him to stick around. ""I'm hoping to be in this universe a little longer,"" he said.
It’s no secret thatCaptain America: Brave New Worlddidn’t exactly light the world on fire in terms ofcritical response, fan response, or box office. Check out IGN's feature,Captain America: Brave New World’s Real Budget? You’ll Never Know… and This Is Why, to find out more.

"Tim Burton may not have directed a Batman movie in over 30 years, but his DC Universe is still going strong. Michael Keaton got the chance to reprise the Bruce Wayne role in 2023’s The Flash, a movie that (briefly) ported his Batman over to the DCEU. But even now, the Burton-Verse continues to expand through new comic book and novel spinoffs likethe recently announced Batman: Revolution.

It’s gotten to the point where the question of how to watch and read the entire Burton-Verse is a surprisingly complicated one. But don’t worry, we’re here to help. Read on for a full breakdown of how the various Tim Burton Batman movies, novels, and comics fit together.
You can also check out our full guide towatching all the Batman movies in order.
Counting the yet-to-be-released Batman: Revolution, there are currently seven projects set in Burton’s Batman universe - three films, two novels, and two comics. That lineup includes 1989’s Batman, 1992’s Batman Returns, and 2023’s The Flash, as well as the books Batman: Resurrection and Batman: Revolution and the comics Batman ‘89 and Batman ‘89: Echoes.
This lineup also excludes 1995’s Batman Forever and 1997’s Batman & Robin, which are no longer considered to be part of Burton’s Batman universe. We’ll get into the reasons why a bit later.
Although you can stream Burton’s Batman movies on Max and read the Batman ‘89 comics on DC Universe Infinite, it never hurts to go the physical media route these days. If you’re looking to buy the Burton-Verse movies and books, here are some good options:
*Each blurb contains a broad overview of the plot and mentions the heroes/villains who appear in that film or book.
This is the original movie that started it all. Burton’s first Batman movie pits Michael Keaton’s Dark Knight (still early in his superhero career) against Jack Nicholson’s Joker. The movie inspired a summer of “Bat-Mania” and proved there was a healthy appetite for darker, more mature superhero movies in Hollywood.
This novel by John Jackson Miller is set in the aftermath of the first movie, as Batman deals with the remnants of the Joker Gang and confronts the rise of the shape-shifting villain known as Clayface. The book is designed to bridge the gap between Batman and Batman Returns, including introducing Christopher Walken’s character Max Shreck and giving readers more insight into the collapse of Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale’s (Kim Basinger) romance.
Miller is returning for a second novel set between the events of Batman and Batman Returns. This time, Revolution will introduce the Burton-Verse’s version of Riddler, a lowly newspaper copy editor named Norman Pinkus who laments the fact that no one appreciates his aptitude for solving crimes. Pinkus will turn to a life of crime and capitalize on the city’s growing resentment toward the wealthy elite of Gotham.
Burton and Keaton both returned for this film sequel, which is set a few years after the events of the first movie. This time, Batman goes up against Michelle Pfeiffer’s Catwoman and Danny DeVito’s Penguin as Gotham City endures a hellish holiday season. Despite initial plans for a third Batman movie, both Burton and Keaton ultimately dropped out of what became 1995’s Batman Forever.
DC’s Batman ‘89 comic serves as a direct sequel to Batman Returns and is set three years later. The six-issue comic, written by Batman screenwriter Sam Hamm and illustrated by Joe Quinones, draws inspiration from Burton’s abandoned plans for a third Batman movie. The book sees Billy Dee Williams’ Harvey Dent become Two-Face, while also introducing a version of Robin modeled after Marlon Wayans (who at one point was attached to play the role in Batman Returns). Michelle Pfeiffer’s Catwoman also makes a return appearance, paying off on the tease from the end of Batman Returns.
Click here to learn more about how Batman ‘89 adds to the Burton-Verse.
Just as Batman ‘89 is essentially Burton’s Batman 3 in comic form, Hamm and Quinones reunited for a follow-up that acts as a hypothetical fourth Burton movie. Three years after the events of Batman ‘89, Keaton’s Bruce Wayne has gone missing, leaving Robin and the new Batgirl to deal with the threat posed by Scarecrow (modeled after Jeff Goldblum) and Harley Quinn (modeled after Madonna).
While only hardcore Burton-Verse completionists need to worry about this one, it's worth mentioning that Robert Wuhl briefly reprises the role of intrepid reporter Alexander Knox in the first chapter of The CW's Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover. That episode briefly shifts focus to Earth-89, where Knox is seen reading a newspaper in a park as red skies form over Gotham. It's one ofnumerous live-action DC cameos in the crossover.
While it didn’t fare well critically or commercially, The Flash at least has the distinction of giving Bat-fans some closure on the saga of Keaton’s Batman. Keaton himself returns to play a much older Bruce Wayne, after Ezra Miller’s Barry Allen mucks about with the DCEU timeline and inadvertently trades one Batman for another. Meeting The Flash and learning about the threat of Michael Shannon’s General Zod is enough to coax Batman out of retirement for one last, high-stakes mission.
1995’s Batman Forever and 1997’s Batman & Robin were once considered sequels to Batman and Batman Returns, despite the fact that neither Burton nor Keaton returned for these projects. The presence of supporting characters like Pat Hingle’s Commissioner Gordon and Michael Gough’s Alfred maintained some degree of continuity with the previous films. However, these two sequels are generally regarded as being inferior to their predecessors, as well as being far different tonally.
With the release of The Flash, DC now officially treats Batman Forever and Batman & Robin as being set in a separate version of the DC Universe. The Batman ‘89 comics now act as the definitive, canon sequels to Batman Returns, revealing what happened to Keaton’s Bruce Wayne between the events of Returns and The Flash.
Warning:this section contains spoilers for The Flash!
The Flash wasn’t always intended to be the end of the road for Keaton’s Batman. At one point, the character was being positioned for an ongoing role in the DCEU (before WB cut that cinematic universe’s future short). Reportedly,a previous version of the movieended not with Batman dying in battle against Zod in the Flashpoint timeline, but with both Keaton’s Bruce and Sasha Calle’s Supergirl crossing over into the restored DCEU. That’s where WB’s canceled Batgirl movie comes in.
Keaton wound up reprising the role again in Batgirl, which reportedly cast him as an aged, Batman Beyond-esque mentor to Leslie Grace’s rookie Barbara Gordon. J.K. Simmons also returned as the DCEU Commissioner Gordon, while Brendan Fraser played the villain Firefly.
The Batgirl movie made it well into post-production beforeWB infamously pulled the plug and canceled it as a tax writeoff. It became a major casualty in the studio’s evolving plans for the DC line and the pivot toJames Gunn and Peter Safran’s DCU. Barring any major leaks, Keaton fans will never have an opportunity to see what will likely be his final Batman performance.

"Batman can only team up with fellow DC heroes like Superman, Wonder Woman, and The Flash so many times before it starts to get a little old. Sometimes, we need a story that shakes things up and removes the barriers between pop culture universes. That’s how we’ve gotten some truly classic and downright weird comic book crossovers over the decades.

From obvious team-ups like Batman/Spider-Man and Batman/The Shadow to more unusual fare like Batman/Elmer Fudd, these are the best (as well as some of the weirdest) Batman crossovers of all time. Note that we’re focused only on the stories where Batman himself is the main player, not Justice League-centric crossovers likeJustice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong.
As arguably the two biggest superheroes in the world, it’s inevitable that Batman and Spider-Man would cross paths at some point. If anything, it’s surprising that Marvel and DC waited until 1995 to make that pairing happen. But Spider-Man and Batman was certainly worth the wait. This crossover zeroes in on the similarities between the two heroes and their respective tragic pasts, while also making the sensible choice to pit them against the tag team psychopathic duo of Joker and Carnage.
Spider-Man and Batman’s greatest strength is that it’s built by two decorated Spider-Man veterans - Kraven’s Last Hunt writer J./M. DeMatteis and prolific Amazing Spider-Man artist Mark Bagley. The result is a book that feels like a natural extension of the ‘90s Spider-Man comics (minus all the Clone Saga nonsense).

As two dark vigilantes with billowing capes and huge fanbases, Spawn and Batman are another natural choice to pair together. To date, there have been three crossovers between the two franchises (including the very recent Batman/Spawn), but we’re giving the nod to the original. That’s because the first crossover boasts the most impressive creative team, joining The Dark Knight Returns writer Frank Miller with Spawn creator Todd McFarlane. That creative pedigree makes for a fun and suitably dark team-up adventure.
Buy Batman/Spawn: The Classic Collection on Amazon.
Since their 2011 reboot at IDW, the Ninja Turtles have gone on to star in a great many crossovers. Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles remains one of the best, thanks to the strong pairing of Batman veteran James Tynion IV and artist Freddie E. Williams II.
This crossover makes for a very entertaining meeting between two worlds, making the most of the clash of personalities between the Batman family and the Turtles. Plus, who among us hasn’t wondered if Batman could take Shredder in a one-on-one duel? Tynion and Williams also find real emotional weight in forging a bond between the Dark Knight and the Heroes in a Half Shell.
The original crossover proved successful enough for DC and IDW to reteam on two direct sequels (plus a separate crossover based on the animated versions of the characters). This crossover evenspawned a 2019 animated movie, which is also well worth watching.

In many ways, the original Golden Age incarnation of Batman is a very different character from what would follow. It’s that version of Batman that shines in this unique and entertaining crossover series. Written by 100 Bullets’ Brian Azzarello and drawn by Identity Crisis’ Rags Morales, First Wave combines a number of iconic pulp heroes into one universe. Here, the Caped Crusader (uncharacteristically toting a pair of guns) rubs elbows with everyone from Doc Savage to The Spirit to Rima the Jungle Girl. The series is a lot of fun, and we only wish the so-called Pulpverse had become a permanent part of DC’s multiversal lineup.

It’s safe to say that without The Shadow there would be no Batman. Pairing the two dark avengers of the night is only logical, and we’re glad this series does such a great job of pitting the two together. Batman/The Shadow opens as the Dark Knight investigates the latest murder in Gotham City, only for the prime suspect to be Lamont Cranston, a man thought to have perished 50 years prior. That’s just the start of a whirlwind team-up.
As with so many books on this list, Batman/The Shadow is all about the creative team - writers Scott Snyder and Steve Orlando and artist Riley Rossmo. Sadly, that full team didn’t return for the follow-up series The Shadow/Batman, but the sequel is still an enjoyable read in its own right.

Even as the movie series floundered, the Predator franchise found a second life in comics during the ‘90s. That includes no fewer than three crossovers between the Dark Knight and the universe’s greatest hunter. For our money, the first is still the one to beat, as it features a terrific story by Watchmen’s Dave Gibbons and art by a pre-X-Men Andy and Adam Kubert.
Batman Versus Predator boasts a simple but very winning premise. A Yautja is running amok in Gotham, and Batman is forced to follow his bloody trail. The creators conjure up a terrific sense of atmosphere, and ultimately do a far better job of capitalizing on the idea of a Predator hunting in a bustling American metropolis than Predator 2.

Batman and Judge Dredd both have a deep commitment to upholding the law and maintaining order in their respective dystopian cities. One would think they’d get along famously. But not so much it turns out, as the first Batman/Judge Dredd crossover shows us. When Judge Death breaches the barriers between dimensions and forms an alliance with Scarecrow, these two costumed heroes will have to put aside their differences for the greater good. And boy do they have some differences…
DC and 2000 AD collaborated on three Batman/Judge Dredd crossovers in the ‘90s, but here again, our money is on the original. It’s really hard to top the appeal of having Dredd co-creator John Wagner involved, along with the surreal, brutal, and downright psychedelic artwork of Simon Bisley. This may just be the best-looking Batman crossover of all time.

Grendel isn’t necessarily the most famous character Batman has crossed paths with over the years, but it’s a pairing that just makes inherent sense. Matt Wagner’s Grendel saga is a meditation on violence and vengeance, two themes central to Batman’s world. And given that Wagner has worked with the Dark Knight solo plenty of times over the years, these characters together become two great tastes that taste great together.
Both the original 1993 crossover and its 1996 sequel are well worth reading. The first pits Batman against the original Grendel Hunter Rose, as the two clash in both the streets and Gotham’s polite society. The sequel shifts focus to Rose’s futuristic successor Grendel-Prime. Both stories are good enough to make you wish Grendel was a permanent part of Batman’s rogues gallery.

Warren Ellis andthe late, great John Cassadayjoined forces for one of DC’s greatest comics ever in the sprawling sci-fi epic Planetary. That series wound up spawning crossovers with both The Authority and the Justice League, but it’s the Batman crossover that truly stands out (in part because it’s the only one of the three to feature the entire creative team from the main series).
In Planetary/Batman, the cantankerous Elijah Snow and his team arrive in a Batman-less Gotham City on the trail of a mysterious killer. Soon, the barriers between worlds are breached, leading to encounters with a great many versions of the Caped Crusader. Half the fun of this crossover is in how it celebrates all eras of Batman’s history, from the classic Golden Age to the campy Silver Age to the brooding avenger of The Dark Knight Returns. This crossover is basically just an extended installment of the main series with a healthy dose of Batman thrown in, and that’s enough to result in one of the best Batman crossovers of all time.

As it happens, the best Batman crossover is also the most bizarre. Batman/Elmer Fudd Special is part of a larger line of mash-ups combining heroes of the DCU with iconic Looney Tunes characters. It’s also far and away the best, mining more out of the goofy premise than we could have ever imagined. This is one of the only comics to everscore a 10 in our IGN review.
The brilliance of Batman/Elmer Fudd is that it plays the pairing completely straight (which, in turn, leads to some truly hilarious moments). This is a 100% serious vision of Batman and Gotham City, one in which Elmer Fudd is cast as a tragic killer not unlike Marv from Sin City. The speech impediment is still there, but the character is pure fury and pathos.
Writer Tom King and artist Lee Weeks wind up wringing a huge amount of emotion and depth out of this sad and wistful yet still hilarious crossover. They’re a great team when they work with Batman alone (as evidenced by their recurring collaboration on DC’s 2016 Batman series), but somehow the addition of Elmer Fudd takes everything up a notch.

"With the wide release of the five-minuteSuperman sneak peekthat was first shown at CinemaCon earlier this week, one thing stands out even more than Krypto’s lovable (if painful for Superman) hijinks: It’s the fact that James Gunn understands the most important thing he can do for his reboot of not just the Man of Steel, but the entire DC universe, is to make us care about the characters. All of the characters, great and small, Kryptonian and human, canine and, yes, even robot.Gigglingrobots.

The extended preview features footage from the film that we’ve seen before, including of course Kal-El’s incredibly cute super dog arriving on the icy scene when his master is at a real low point. But it expands on that sequence fromthe film’s first trailer, showing us that Krypto is very much the troublemaker Gunn has described him to be. Yes, Superman is bloodied and beaten, pleading with Krypto to take him “home,” but all the pup wants to do is play. And he makes this point by jumping on the hurt Supes with all of his super-dog strength, and even dragging Kal-El’s leg up into an extremely awkward yet entirely believable pose. “Play with me, Dad!” he’s saying, in deeds if not words. It’s all very funny and it makes you love Krypto even more than you already did. Oh yes, you will believe that a super-powered dog can fly – and be lovable.
But Supermanishurt, and Krypto finally gets it, bringing Kal to the Fortress of Solitude. And that’s where we meet that giggling robot, who is one of the keys to understanding why James Gunn is so good at what he does. But before we get to that, consider that the first time we ever saw Gunn’s version of the Last Son of Krypton in action, he was in bad shape – beaten up, bleeding, needing hisdogto save him. And we don’t yet know who dished out this punishment either, so this first image of Gunn’s version of Superman battered and broken is not for the benefit of getting a villain over. There’s no “look how scary this antagonist is because they beat the hell out of the Man of Steel.” The purpose of beginning the entire marketing push for this film is to show Superman in dire straits and in need of help. It’s a far cry from the typical introduction of any superhero, let alonethesuperhero, and yet it makes perfect sense coming from Gunn.
It’s the Harrison Ford Syndrome. Which isn’t so much a syndrome as it is a legitimate strength of Ford’s on screen persona. Either way, think about how badly Indiana Jones gets roughed up. We don’t love him because he’s so good at fighting; it’s because he’s tired and in pain just like the rest of us. Think about the scared-as-shit look on Ford’s face when he was on the run in The Fugitive, the desperate man leaping off of a dam en route to prove his innocence. Think about the hurt on Han Solo’s face, the fully bruised ego when he thought Leia was into Luke and not him at the start of Empire. It’s an everyman appeal that few actors have ever really been able to pull off. Honestly, it might just be Ford and Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley that do it completely right. The point is, seeing your heroes beat up a little bit kind of makes you love them even more, especially when they rise to the occasion later to be, you know,heroes, despite everything they’ve been through.
Gunn knows this, and he has a track record of putting his characters through the ringer. Think back to the first time we met the Guardians of the Galaxy. The first trailer for that film shows that nobody knows Star-Lord’s name and that it stings a little. And yes, Star-Lord was a little known character from the depths of Marvel’s roster, and Superman is… well, it’s almost apples to oranges, but Gunn’s approach is exactly the same here. Let’s put some dents in our main character as quickly as we can. Let’s meet a protagonist at a moment when they’renotheroic, not saving the day, when they don’t even have the upper hand – that’s part of what makes Gunn’s superhero work resonate as well as anybody’s ever been able to.
So giving us a Superman who right off the bat has broken ribs, a jacked-up bladder, and is in awful pain even when/because his robots are healing him… it’s a very Gunn choice, and it goes a long way to getting us invested in his version of a character who, let’s not forget, has had like 10 movies and 15 TV shows or something at this point and is older than your grandparents. Superman and all his pals have been around forever, so why should we care about yet another version of his story?
And not for nothing, it’s important to remember that a significant criticism has been lobbed at Superman over the years saying his invulnerability and squeaky clean boy scout-ness are just plain boring. He was, after all, created to be the best of us, but crafting interesting narratives around an overpowered alien with only a single weakness can start to get hard after a century. So howdoyou make this familiar story engaging? Opening on a shot of a damaged Kal-El is a great start, but we still need to fall for the supporting cast.
And that brings us back to the giggling robot. Once Krypto gets his dad into the Fortress (which is a cool re-thinking of the classic Richard Donner ice-crystal Fortress of Solitude, only in this case one that grows out of the snowy landscape on command), the robots take custody of Superman as they carry the injured hero in to treat his wounds. In the comics we know that the ‘bot known asKelex is usually the main caretaker of the Fortress, although here we see the main robot has the simple designation of “4” on the Superman-shield on his chest.
As they tend to Superman, 4 (voiced by Alan Tudyk) introduces the newest robot of the group: “Meet 12. She’s new.” Superman nods to her weakly, and 12 practically blushes, despite being made of metal, as she giggles and says “Oh, he looked at me!”
12 has just that one line of dialogue (we're not sure who’s voicing the character but it’s gotta be someone we know, right?), but we're already so invested in her and these other robots that we're a little embarrassed to admit it. 4 also tells Kal-El that there’s no need to thank them for their service because they have “no consciousness whatsoever. Merely automatons here to serve.” But you know what? We're calling bullshit on that right now, because you can be guaranteed that half of us are going to be crying when we see the movie and one of these robots gets killed (something that in fact has already been teased in the first trailer). There’s also something about Tudyk’s delivery of those lines, like he’s dripping with sarcasm. No consciousness my red-briefs-clad-butt.
So even while comics fans can dig in and try to figure out if 4 is Kelex or how Superman’s biology works (he has intestines!) or whatever other lore or Easter egg stuff comes to mind, Gunn isn’t actually that concerned with that stuff. At minimum, we feel comfortable saying it doesn’t seem like his first priority. Yes, he understands the geeky things, he’s a fan himself and he’s read the comics – and loves them, no doubt – but what he’s doing here is building out little character moments and beats that will make us actually care about these people. And robots. And dogs!
This isn’t gonna be aSuperman movieas much as it is a James Gunn movie, and we can’t wait."
"Dark Regards is easily the most intriguing new indie comics to come along in quite some time. It's a book whose back-story is as wild and crazy as the comic itself. But you can be the judge in our exclusive preview of Dark Regards #1.

Check out the slideshow gallery below for an exclusive look inside the new series, but beware of some NSFW language ahead!
Dark Regards is the brainchild of comedian/writer/musician Dave Hill and artist Artyom Topilin (Cruel Universe, I Hate This Place). The four-issue series is inspired by Hill's own experiences forming a fictional Satanic metal band called Witch Taint and the unexpected spiral of chaos that ensued.
Here's Oni Press' official description of the series:
Two decades ago, Dave Hill and his first band set out to rock their high school auditorium in a fury of heavy metal hellfire. They failed miserably. Years later, Dave has made a new life for himself as a rising star in the New York comedy scene – a career where getting laughed at on stage is the entire point and not just a tragic consequence. But when Dave's metal ambitions are re-awakened by the über self-serious, “Satanic” genre of Norwegian black metal, Dave creates a ridiculously hyperbolic alter ego and a band to match that, together, reignite the spark of his forgotten rock 'n roll fantasy. But when Dave's internet-fueled rumors of Witch Taint – a metal band “so extreme that you must remove all sharp objects from the immediate area” when their music is played – spreads all the way to Europe, his story will spiral dangerously out of control as Norway's most extreme black metal butchers come to reap their revenge . . . and put everything and everyone Dave holds dear in the crosshairs (of their axes, which, truth be told, don't actually have crosshairs, but, hey, it's a metaphor).
“A few years back, I sat down in my underwear late one night and decided to let my obsession with Norwegian black metal run wild by emailing a Norwegian black metal record label, telling them all the bands on their label sucked despite the fact that I had never listened to any of them, and suggesting they sign my extremely extreme black metal band Witch Taint, which had yet to record any music and didn't even exist beyond the band name I'd just made up on the spot,” said Hill in a statement. “This first email led to months of correspondence with the record label that I never intended for anyone to see. But the Internet being the Internet, eventually a lot of people saw it and things got nuts. Now, beyond my wildest dreams, this story has become my first comic book series Dark Regards, written by me and illustrated by the amazing Artyom Topilin. If you don't devour every single issue, you are basically insane.”
Dark Regards #1 is priced at $4.99 and will be released on May 13, 2025.

"As March marksWomen’s History Monthin the US, we wanted to highlight the women here at IGN. Last year, we highlighted some staff picks ofgames, movies, and TV. This year we switched gears to another favorite hobby: reading.

When the women of IGN were asked, “Who are your favorite women authors?” – no easy question for avid readers – a fascinating list sprung to life that spanned genres and styles. Let’s see which authors and comic artists were included as we celebrate both the women of IGNandtheir favorite women authors!

Kelly Sue DeConnick has been battling in the trenches of the “boys club” of comics for years. When she wrote for Marvel, she was the one who brought the title of Captain Marvel to Carol Danvers, a legacy brought over into the MCU years later with her name in the credits as a consultant for the films. Outside of the Big Two, she's been an ever-present voice in indie comics with works like Pretty Deadly (if you're looking for a more mystical western theme) and Bitch Planet (if you want a more sci-fi, dystopian, feminist vibe). She continues with her current project, FML, from Dark Horse Comics for those looking for a more supernatural vibe in our stories. If you haven't read anything she's written yet, you're doing yourself a disservice: DeConnick is an incredible writer and an amazing human. –Chelsea Reed

Sarah Rose Etter writes weird but clear-eyed books for weird people (like me). Though she’s only published two novels thus far, both have been among my favorite books of the year they came out. The Book of X, about a woman born to generational meat farmers and women with their stomach twisted into a knot, was surreal and painfully relatable; Ripe, about a young woman suffering through her job at a recognizably psychotic San Francisco startup and haunted by an ever-present void, swapped that formula (and also ends not unlike Rose Glass’ film Saint Maud). I hope she writes 100 more books like these in my lifetime. –Leanne Butkovic

It's unlikely this is the first time you're being recommended N.K. Jemisin's incredible The Broken Earth Trilogy. Though her other fantasy novels deserve attention in their own right, Jemisin's captivating writing, characters, and creative magic system in The Broken Earth Trilogy (specifically in the second book, The Obelisk Gate) make it the easiest to recommend. Her surprising playfulness with storytelling in The Fifth Season may be confusing for some at first, but stick with it – the payoff is fantastic. It follows Essun, a woman trying to hunt down her husband who murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter while trying to survive a recurring cataclysmic event and hide that she has powers to manipulate the very earth around her. It's an incredible, Hugo Award-winning ride. –Miranda Sanchez

It's astounding just how much T. Kingfisher publishes in a year but my adventure-loving heart appreciates the number of Kingfisher's consistently interesting retakes on classic fairy tales and horror stories. Kingfisher's stories tend to skew toward gothic horror and dark fantasy, but even still, her comedic pacing and thoughtfully written characters provide a sometimes needed balance for various novels' heavy themes. Whether it's the slow and creeping exploration of emotional abuse in ""What Moves the Dead"" or her exquisite Saint of Steel fantasy romance series that deals with personal identity and loss, I've come away with a full heart (and feeling a little creeped out). –MS
Notable works: Nettle & Bone, What Moves the Dead, Paladin's Grace
Maybe it’s overly obvious to be recommending the most recent Nobel Prize winner for Literature – even members of BTS celebrated her accomplishment on Instagram – but all of the praise lauded on Han Kang is apparent when you crack open one of her novels. Like most people, I was introduced to her work through The Vegetarian when it was translated into English in 2015 and was immediately taken by its disturbingly mesmerizing plot about a housewife who stops eating meat, to the confusion and dismay of those around her, and eventually food altogether. (It’s even more aesthetically arresting knowing that it released in South Korea a full eight years prior.) I’ve followed her ever since, from the thematically similar Greek Lessons to the true-to-life South Korean political atrocities in Human Acts and We Do Not Part, and I cannot implore you enough to read Han Kang. She is a genius andabsolute badass. –LB

Newly published but already on her way to releasing a third novel, Yume Kitasei is an imaginative sci-fi writer with a promising career ahead of her. While many of my favorite sci-fi writers tend to have expansive series, Kitasei's one-off stories delightfully build their worlds quickly, and their engaging stories move even faster. Her debut, The Deep Sky, is a neat murder mystery aboard a tech-filled spaceship bound for the hopeful future home of humanity that was hard to put down. Her follow-up, The Stardust Grail, is an Indiana Jones-style adventure as its protagonist races her enemies to find an ancient alien artifact that is the key to her friend's survival but potentially the doom of her own. Both are lovely and imaginative, and I can't wait to read her next novel that's out later this fall. –MS

Sarah J. Mass is a queen in the fantasy romance genre who constantly leaves me jaw-dropped with everything she has created. Her world-building and storytelling are so incredibly detailed, that she quickly became one of my favorite fantasy authors. She’s generally best known for the remarkable series A Court of Thorns and Roses – currently a five-book series with more releases coming – which dives into a story about a young woman who ends up living in a magical realm. In it, she finds her confidence and strength while battling through internal and external wars among the Fae – who are basically humans with super strength, magical powers, and immortality. Her first series was Throne of Glass, an amazing eight-book series that started her fantasy writing and world-building when she was only a teenager. Her latest series, Crescent City, has three books so far, with a fourth to come. All three of her series take place in the fantasy world of the Fae, so when readers are fans of one of her series, they tend to enjoy the others as well. Mass’ ability to develop strong characters and exciting twists leaves her stories equally entwined with the fantastical elements of the story and the romance side of things. For those looking for epic fantasy stories with romance and a bit of spice, jump into the Fae world with these books. –Jessie Wade
Notable works: A Court of Thorns and Roses, Throne of Glass, Crescent City
There seemingly isn't a genre Silvia Moreno-Garcia won't tackle. Whether it's a historical romance with a touch of fantasy in The Beautiful Ones or a dark vampire adventure set in Mexico City in Certain Dark Things, Moreno-Garcia nails it every time. Some of her romance-forward stories feel a little similar in their dynamics if you read them back to back, but it's easy to make sure that doesn't happen if you're new to her small library of published works. The majority of her works tend to skew toward dark historical fantasy set throughout North America – and, more often than not, in Mexico, which is wonderfully refreshing. Anything she publishes has a guaranteed spot on my limited bookshelf space. –MS
Notable works: Mexican Gothic, Gods of Jade and Shadow, Silver Nitrate
Erin Morganstern's two novels, The Night Circus and The Starless Sea, read like falling into a dream. Morganstern is another of the very few authors whose books I will not only buy in hardcover instantly but also grab multiple copies to collect the various editions. The Night Circus is a luscious, historical fantasy romance about two magicians trained since childhood for their inevitable battle against one another at a mysterious circus. It's guaranteed to break me out of a reading slump whenever I pick it up again and was the book that drew me back into regularly reading as an adult. (Sometimes you've gotta not look at a screen, as much as I love spending my time playing video games.)  Her second novel, The Starless Sea, is a winding, enchanting story about stories. It begins in the world we know before protagonist Zachary finds his way into an underground realm that serves as the library of all stories and it's in danger. Like her debut, The Starless Sea is wonderfully written and best paired with a warm cup of tea. –MS
Notable works: The Night Circus, The Starless Sea
I get a little giddy when I hear that a new Helen Oyeyemi book is on its way. A truly singular voice, Oyeyemi is hard to pin down in a way that’s like – stick with me here – trying to chase down a wispy ghost that’s purposefully messing with you but you’re still having a great time anyway. Her novels are fantastical, but aren’t really fantasy at all; a chunk of them are inspired by Hans Christian Anderson folktales, but the look and feel could not be further from their progenitors. (Gingerbread, for example, is vaguely Hansel and Gretel-ish put through a capitalist meat grinder.) Mostly they’re all fever dream adventures that nuke the rules of literary fiction. As another great writer Alexandra Kleemansaid to The Nation, Oyeyemi’s work has “the discombobulating quality of walking through a moving vehicle while carrying a full-to-the-brim cup of very hot tea.” –LB

For those of you who have been mourning the end of the Game of Thrones TV show and are waiting rather impatiently for George R.R. Martin to finally publish The Winds of Winter, Samantha Shannon is here to ease your suffering. The Roots of Chaos series, starting with The Priory of the Orange Tree, is exactly the kind of high fantasy series we all deserve. With rich characters, dragons, magic, suspense, tragedy, and a satisfying twist, this 845-page book will keep you on the edge of your seat and immersed in another world for as long as you let it. Another prequel, A Day of Fallen Night, was published only three years later, but excitement continues with yet another prequel, Among the Burning Flowers, which will be coming out later this year. If you've been itching to start a new series, this is the perfect time to jump in. –CR

Sue Lynn Tan's debut, Daughter of the Moon Goddess, is a gorgeous reimagining and expansion of the Chinese legend of the moon goddess and continues with its follow-up, Heart of the Sun Warrior. Together, they are the most delicious romantic adventures I've read. The duology eloquently gives context to Chinese mythology for those unfamiliar with it while keeping the pace of the action steady. As the first book's title suggests, the hidden daughter of the exiled moon goddess, Xingyin, takes the role of protagonist when she's sent into hiding among the Celestial Kingdom while her mother must continue her imprisonment on the moon. Determined to set her mother free, Xingyin goes on an epic, inspiring adventure to set things right. Tan's complex characters and strong understanding of romantic pacing make these instant standouts among romantic fantasy novels. –MS

Written for young adults, Jacqueline Wilson's works touch on hard-to-talk-about topics such as grief and loss, substance abuse, bullying, and abandonment. I grew up reading Wilson's books, and could often relate to her characters due to my own tough upbringing. I would often escape to my local library and bury myself in one of her books to feel less alone in what I was going through. She has won several awards for her work, including a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (basically the best award you can get!) by King Charles III for her ""services to Literature."" –Meg Koepp

Rebecca Yarros’sEmpyrean seriesis a striking adult fantasy romance that follows a young woman’s experience going to a war college for dragon riders. If you can imagine humans working with dragons to prepare for war, you can guess (correctly) that it’s brutal right off the bat. Even though violence takes a prominent, integral role in the books, it doesn’t overtake the importance of the storyline itself, the characters, and the world-building. Yarros does a phenomenal job creating relatable characters who deal with serious challenges, both physical and mental, they need to learn to overcome, but there’s a theme of friendship and support throughout. The romance is woven into the story in an organic way that complements the plot well, while still keeping the excitement in the fantasy world. Even for those not interested in the romance side of it, you’ll likely end up adoring the characters’ experiences together and crave more of it the further you read. Yarros has this ability to create such complex storylines with so many unexpected twists and turns, leaving you constantly hyped. She reveals more of her worlds as she goes on through the books, and when I say she’ll crush your world and then rebuild it (hopefully), I mean it. You’ll be surprised how attached you get to dragons and think of them as real people. The Empyrean series is a five-book series and the third book was released on January 21, 2025, with two still to come. –JW

"Warning: this review contains full spoilers for Episode 3 of Daredevil: Born Again!

The third episode of Daredevil: Born Again comes aftera riveting two-part opener, so it’s understandable that things are now cooling down a bit this week. There’s a focus on Hector Ayala’s trial that leads to all manner of legal twists and turns, but even the twistiest lawyer drama isn’t exactly the most thrilling thing to watch. Matt Murdock arguing the case for a vigilante certainly makes for a lot of interesting material on a thematic level, and all of the performances remain top-notch, but there’s a disappointing lack of superhero intrigue because Daredevil doesn’t make an appearance. Still, this episode creates a complex and dangerous dynamic between Murdock and the police force, and the shocking ending stayed with me long after the credits rolled.
Even though I came into this episode knowing the tragedy that befalls White Tiger in the comics, I was still shocked to see him abruptly assassinated at the end of the episode. By someone wearing a Punisher logo, no less. Above all else, the show genuinely makes you feel the immense loss of Hector Ayala as not only a superhero but as a human being. Actor Kamar de los Reyes’ opening monologue had me getting emotional over singing frogs, which made hearing them over the end credits even more heartbreaking.
This is a bit of a dicey episode for our main character. It’s clear to see that talking to Ayala makes him reflect on his own vigilantism as Daredevil, though Murdock seems to be in a place where he’s content only helping people as an attorney and not as a superhero. Will Hector’s unjust, violent end be enough to make him put on the mask again? The way he keeps fidgeting with that broken horn certainly makes me think so.
But how Murdock handles the trial didn’t work for me. It’s far too reckless and theatrical, even for him. I didn’t buy his reasoning explaining away his cavalier actions. Outing Ayala as the White Tiger ends up winning him the case, but he of all people should know how dangerous it is to reveal another hero’s secret identity. (Case in point: a gunman was able to wait outside Ayala’s home and murder him when he stepped out onto the street.) Murdock’s tactics are especially shortsighted when you consider how Mayor Fisk ran a whole campaign demonizing vigilantes. Even the judge calls out Murdock for being a huge hypocrite and he brushes it off. Also, having Nicky Torres flake out on the witness stand is an odd twist because it’s never explained what they had on him or how they even got in contact with him while he was in witness protection. I appreciate the writers trying to liven up the courtroom drama, but it comes at the expense of Murdock’s credibility as a lawyer.
What we said about the Daredevil: Born Again series premiere
Daredevil: Born Again does a bang up job with ol’ Hornhead’s long-awaited return. The show captures the signature drama and brutality of Netflix’s Daredevil series while taking the story of Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk in a bold (and surprisingly topical) new direction. It’s to Marvel’s credit that they’ve set up such a gripping face-off not between Daredevil and Kingpin but between their civilian-facing personas. But for all the new show does right, there are still a few quibbles to be had – mainly, the lack of supporting characters who pop in these first two episodes and the fact that we are yet again getting a story about Murdock giving up being Daredevil. –Joshua Yehl
Read the complete Daredevil: Born Again series premiere review
This is a quieter episode for Wilson Fisk, as his relationship with Vanessa continues to languish and his allies from his Kingpin days refuse to let him escape his old life. Looks like the police chief was right when he told Fisk, “Once a thug, always a thug” in episode 2. Becoming mayor has truly changed the character. He went from feeling like his status as the Kingpin of crime made him the most powerful man in the world to now calling crime lords petty, squabbling vermin. This, of course, mirrors Murdock’s state of mind, where he believes he’s moved on to something better, when in reality he’ll never be able to escape his true self.
The Punisher’s presence continues to grow as we see another cop with a skull tattoo (on his neck) and Ayala’s murderer, as previously mentioned, wearing the symbol. I have to imagine that these men have appropriated the Punisher logo and the actual Punisher, Frank Castle, has nothing to do with them. I hope this means he’ll be making his big entrance next episode, and I imagine he won’t be happy with what others have done in his name.
Other Thoughts
The third episode of Daredevil: Born Again is a bit underwhelming compared to the great one-two punch of the premiere. The trial of Hector Ayala plays a key role in making Murdock do some self reflection, and Kamar de los Reyes does a fantastic job conveying the heart and soul of his wrongly accused vigilante. But the legal drama alone isn’t enough to pick up the slack of a Daredevil-less episode. There’s a lot of setup for future conflicts, most notably the jaw-dropping ending, so at the very least this episode does the job of creating excitement for what’s to come."
"So, you might’ve heard this little tidbit of news lately:Stranger ThingsstarSadie Sink is officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the next Spider-Man. But now comes the speculation: who, exactly, will she play in Spider-Man 4?

You’ve got theories, I’ve got theories, and we’re not alone — the whole internet’s got theories. Needless to say, fans' minds are racing. So what do they think? Well, let’s go over the most distinct possibilities (and, for that matter, impossibilities).
It seems as though most folks find the idea of Sink ending up being the, quote unquote, real Mary Jane Watson due to her red hair to be a bit silly. “Michelle Jones isthe MCU’s real MJ,” one fan wrote on Reddit — and most fans in the thread agreed. Though another Redditor noted the studio might cast Sink in the role as a “bold attempt to win back those who prefer classic Spider-Man.” The obvious choice is not always the best one, folks.
Zendayahas played the MCU’s new MJ since 2017’s Spider-Man Homecoming, and despite not being the standard red-haired Mary Jane fans know from the comics andSam Raimi’s previous trilogy, modern day Spidey lovers have generally accepted her as their MJ. So it seems as though they’ll keep her around, especially considering she is said to be, at minimum, coming back for a cameo for this yet untitled sequel toNo Way Home.
Some fans think Sink may end up playing one of Peter Parker’s other love interests, Gwen Stacey. After all, wigsdoexist. “Much to the surprise(and potentially dismay) of everyone,” one user said about Sink in the role previously played by Emma Stone in Marc Webb’s The Amazing Spider-Man duo. “I absolutely would not want to see [that] sincewe’ve already gotten a Gwen Stacy/Peter Parker love storyand I definitely have no interest in seeing Spider-Gwen right now,” another Redditor added.
Spider-Gwen is a distinct part of the animated Spider-Verse, where she is voiced by Hailee Steinfeld, so it seems like fans prefer to follow her story there for the time being. Consideringhow major the Peter and Gwen love story wasin Webb’s Spider-Man films — itdidgive way to a lengthy real-life relationship between Stone and Andrew Garfield, who played Parker/Spider-Man — it makes sense that fans wouldn’t really want to see that rehashed. There’s a ton of Spidey territory to cover between his many comic adventures and appearances, so giving Sink something different to do is most likely the key to making her inclusion a success.
Another theory folks have been throwing around is the idea that Sink might end up playing another famous MCU redhead: X-Men’s Jean Grey, also known as the Phoenix. She was played as an adult by Famke Janssen in five films in Fox’s X-Men franchise. Later, she was portrayed as a teenager by Sophie Turner in2019’s Dark Phoenix.
One user on Reddit considered that idea “too obvious,” while another agreed and added: “Weird to intro [her] in SM4.” That said, a third fan noted that there could always be more castings in the future that could lead tomore mutants joining the fold for Spider-Man 4. Others have doubts about a mutant showing up with true relevance in a Spider-Man focused film. “I just don't seeone of the core X-Men getting introduced in a Spider-Man movie,” a fan wrote.
But it seems as though the most popular guess — and potentially the best guess as well — is a lesser known character called Firestar, a redhead mutant named Angelica Jones who is a mainstay in the X-Men, as well as the 1981 animated seriesSpider-Man and His Amazing Friendswhere she debuted. She could definitely be that “something different” I was talking about — and lots of fans seem excited about the prospect of bringing her into the story as it stands within the MCU.
Indeed, fans seem particularly excited at the idea of bringing those Amazing Friends back together. “She'll be a college student alongside Peter and their friend/partner Bobby Drake. They'll all live in the same apartment too,” one user commented. “This will bethe adaptation of Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends we've all been waiting for, lol.” Another agreed, “I would lovea Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends team-up!” while a third added: “If they did the Amazing Friends lineup,people would lose their minds.”
Firestar started as a Spider-Man character, but eventually broke off and expanded into her own story that included alliances with the New Mutants, Hellions, and the Avengers themselves. So considering her origins, it might just be the perfect character to introduce. However, one fandidmention, “If Firestar, why not Jean?” and to be fair, they have a point. But right now, it’s anyone’s guess who Sink will end up making her MCU debut as. Only time will tell.

"The first episode of My Hero Academia: Vigilantes is now streaming on Crunchyroll.

My Hero Academia is nearing its conclusion, but its first seven seasons – with their focus on the heroes-in-training of U.A. High School – have only shown us a sliver of a fascinating world where most people have superpowers (a.k.a. Quirks) and some parlay their Quirk into a lucrative career. Enter My Hero Academia: Vigilantes, an adaptation of the manga of the same name written by Hideyuki Furuhashi and illustrated by Betten Court. This is both a spin-off and a prequel to the main show,, and it’s not only a worthy expansion of the My Hero Academia universe, but a dazzling anime whose visual style pays tribute to classic superhero comics.
The anime follows Koichi Haimawari, an 18-year-old with a desire to help people despite having a less-than-stellar Quirk. His power allows him to travel quickly across any flat surface – as long as he makes contact with that surface with at least three limbs. Unfortunately, he’s no Flash: at top speed, he only moves about as fast as a bicycle. In many ways, Koichi is like My Hero Academia lead Deku: Both are big-hearted optimists and admirers of the world’s greatest superhero, All Might. In others, he’s a different kind of superhero for MHA: An everyman. The premiere does a lot of work to establish Koichi’s relatability.  Sure he has a Quirk, but it’s not one that’s useful for superheroics. He tries to help people, but cowers when things get too real.
Even in the first episode, it is clear Vigilantes is giving audiences a different perspective on My Hero Academia. This is not a show about big villains with grand schemes fighting the A-listers. Its concerns are smaller, like the frustration of a convenience-store work being robbed by a small-time vandal with Wolverine claws. These are the villains that aren't prioritized or even acknowledged by cops or heroes. It’s in line with the parent series: The best parts of MHA’s world-building involve the way regular people view hero society; in its earliest goings, it portrayed heroes as celebrities who sometimes cared more about endorsements than saving lives. Vigilantes promises to be a fascinating new spin on that idea, with a street-level view of a world where superpowers don’t just exist, but are common.
Without a doubt, the visuals are the main draw of the series so far. Director Kenichi Suzuki (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders) and the animators at Bones Studio B (Mob Psycho 100) give Vigilante an art style that is distinct from the flagship series – even compared to other series adapted from manga, this one has distinctly comic-book-y aesthetic. The character outlines are thick, the shading is striking, and the colors pop. Every frame is vibrant; like the Spider-Verse movies, sounds effects are rendered as onscreen onomatopoeia. (“Bam!” “Pow!,” etc.). The first episode doesn't reach the level of epic action of My Hero Academia, but these touches make even small alley brawls feel unique and dynamic.
Vigilantes is its own, smaller-scale story completely unconcerned with top heroes and U.A. High School. But some familiar faces show up nonetheless. Fortunately, these cameos and guest appearances (in the premiere, at least) aren’t shoehorned in as reminders of Vigilantes’ roots. Instead, they’re just another example of the fully realized, lived-in world in which these episodes take place in.
My Hero Academia: Vigilantes is a worthy spin-off of the popular superhero anime. Its small scale story and focus on street-level heroism expands the show's world in interesting ways, while introducing a relatable, everyman hero. The anime boasts a dazzling art direction that translate the vibrant colors and lively onomatopoeia of a classic superhero comic to the TV screen."
"With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its wayandits audience.

Capcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.
But in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.
2016 was a bad year for Capcom.
The big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.
This was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.
All of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .
Achieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.
Capcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4.
2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema.
Unfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.
“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.
This directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op.
This downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.
But it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.
This slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.
It was clear something needed to change.
By the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability.
While neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.
“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”
Those constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6.
""We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V,"" Nakayama says. ""And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title.""
All this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards.“There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.
“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”
The team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.
There was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master.
“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.”
Street Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series.
While they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.
While Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.
Around the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience.
“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”
If you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.
“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”
Itsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance.
No other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened.
Firstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.
“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”
Monster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.
This created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.
But the reality was that Monster Hunterdidhave fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.
Released in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.
“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”
It was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”
It wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world.
“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”Tsujimoto says.
One important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.
This explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.
“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”
Monster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call.
“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&D teams were divided into R&D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”
Takeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.
There were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.
“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.
The game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series.
But Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time.
“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.
The result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history.
Naturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?
Ampo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”
But despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.
Around the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.
“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.”
Itsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.
The 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. ""Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively,"" Itsuno says. ""When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”
This vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should.
Ampo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, ""So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.”
This meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.
“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”
Since 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.
Focusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat.
But what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.
Many of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever.
When asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”
Monster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”

"Side Quest is now streaming on Apple TV+.

Over the course of four seasons (the most recent of which just ended),Mythic Questhas built a fully realized, ripe-for-exploration universe around the sturdy core of a classic workplace sitcom. This is part of the reason why it’s one of the best, most reliable TV comedies of the streaming era – it doesn’t hurt that the Apple TV+ series set in the world of video-game development is also extremely funny. Hot on the heels of its fourth-season finale comes Side Quest, an entertaining anthology series that delves further into the lives of the people who make, play, and love Mythic Quest’s namesake MMORPG. The parent series has wandered down these kinds of one-off detours several times, and almost always found a worthwhile destination – most notably the first-season highlight “A Dark Quiet Death.” Yet, at a mere four episodes, Side Quest’s expansion pack feels like it ends just as it gets going.
Let’s get this out of the way: Nothing in Side Quest surpasses or even comes close to “A Dark Quiet Death”’s level of quality. It’s never as substantial as that exceptional piece of television, but the spinoff is still a good elaboration on Mythic Quest’s themes of community and boundaries. And while it’s not like Side Quest contains overly complicated links to previous episodes or puzzles to solve, some details will get lost in translation if it’s your first encounter with the fantastical realms maintained by Ian Grimm, Poppy Li, and company.
Of the four episodes, the first, “Song and Dance,” has the strongest ties to the Mythic Quest office: It follows beleaguered art director Phil (Derek Waters) in his continually thwarted attempts to disconnect for a few days. Having appeared in six episodes across seasons 2 and 3, Phil is enough of a fixture that viewers will immediately recognize his downtrodden aura – Ian (Rob McElhenney) has a history of throwing last-minute assignments at him and expecting immediate results. Ian doesn’t respect anyone else’s free time, and as we see in “Song and Dance,” that carries over to Phil’s luxury vacation with his girlfriend Maude, played byPen15’s Anna Konkle.
Thirty minutes of Phil having his time off disrupted by calls from Ian would get stale quickly, so I’m grateful that “Song and Dance” is more about digging deeper into his personal life and psyche. This enriches the Mythic Quest universe: All we know about Phil prior to “Song and Dance” is how put-upon he is, but there’s no interior life in a running gag. We’ve seen Ian cross work-life boundaries before; it might seem like there isn’t any new ground to cover here. But Phil’s low self-esteem adds an extra dimension to the dilemma. Konkle contributes significantly to that feeling, too, hitting notes that are equal parts frustrated and loving – never too smothering, and never too cold, either.
The remaining three episodes distance themselves from Ian and the MQ regulars, which lends some additional novelty to the proceedings. Whereas Mythic Quest has boasted some big-name guest stars in the past – Anthony Hopkins, William Hurt, and Joe Manganiello, to just name a few – Side Quest avoids stunt casting, which suits the types of stories it’s telling. Not to say that this is a cast of fresh faces and newcomers, but there also isn’t anyone whose established star power or fame pulls focus or feels like an odd fit in such humble surroundings.
This also feels in line with the ways Side Quest explores how we form community through art. Games are only one piece of the picture: The second episode, “Pull List,” takes place in a comic-book store. This blind-box stacking, Magic: The Gathering card-slinging spiritual cousin to High Fidelity (the John Cusackmovieandthe Zoë Kravitz Hulu show) is my favorite of the four episodes, but part of me thinks that picking a favorite is a Rorschach Test for your relationship to Mythic Quest. In this case, it underlines how much the ensemble-focused episodes like season 4’s murder mystery, “The Villain’s Feast,” tend to stand out and resonate. (Besides: The more I sit with it, the more my Side Quest ranking changes.)
As the staff and clientele of Comics Galore! trade punchy dialogue about whether Superman or Goku would win in a fight and what characters they claim as Black (Elmo: yes, Big Bird: no), Mythic Quest lore blends deeper our pop-culture world. Written by Leann Bowen and Javier Scott, “Pull List” digs into what makes someone a fan, the pissing matches that sometimes result from trying to prove that fandom, and the growing tension between multiple characters coveting the store’s lone copy of the latest Mythic Quest tie-in comic. It also sets itself apart from the rest of the anthology visually, with playful graphics that pull comic–book imagery into the real world.
Each episode has its own distinct visual identity, but the overall look is still unmistakably Mythic Quest. That’s especially true of the season finale, “The Last Raid,” a screenlife story à laUnfriendedorSearchingdepicting a milestone raid for a long-running guild. In-game graphics punctuate regular Mythic Quest episodes, and here they take center stage as one group of online friends face their greatest test: the way their IRL relationships are developing (or faltering). It’d make a great double feature with the recently released, staging-a-Shakespearean-tragedy-in-GTA-Online documentaryGrand Theft Hamlet: Another sympathetic, nonjudgmental (but still funny) depiction of how video games can be a lifeline for the socially isolated.
Side Quest’s ability to explore so much new terrain through the lens of a single, fictional video game is why I wish it were longer. And while the scope may be there, and all four episodes are engaging and thought-provoking, they ultimately lack the oomph of “A Dark Quiet Death” or its second-season counterpart, “Backstory!” It falls plainly on one end of the Goldilocks principle that plagues many streaming series: Not enough episodes to satisfy our hunger for more Mythic Quest; too slight to stick with you after the credits roll. This is no more apparent than in the third episode, which imparts its message early on but lacks a punch to carry it home. Its story of a cellist learning to separate her passion and her profession (with help from the Mythic Quest score) is sweet, but not much else. Still, it’s a credit to the creative team and performers that I became emotionally invested in all of these characters' lives within the span of 30 minutes. If only there were a few more chances to do so.
It’s no surprise that a Mythic Quest spinoff would be a funny and often heartfelt exploration of community. The four episodes of Side Quest all take on different elements of the MQ universe, tapping into struggles with work-life balance and how a job can consume your life. The first episode eases us with a familiar character, but the three that follow aren’t afraid to delve into new settings populated by unfamiliar faces. It’s an enjoyable and ambitious supplement to one of today’s best streaming comedies – but at only four episodes, Side Quest feels too slight, and unable to reach the high bar set by previous Mythic Quest one-offs."
"The Arkham Horror universe has a whole lot of games in its catalogue. In fact, there are so many to choose from that we’ve had to separate them into two guides. In this buying guide, we will go through the several families of board games. If you’re seeking information about the manydeck-building card gamesalso under the umbrella, you can click on over to ourArkham Horror: The Card Game Buying Guide.

Arkham Horror is an long-running franchise ofhorror board games. You and your fellow players embark on missions that involve a lot of communication to win. The games each have several pathways that can be taken depending on which roles, expansions, and campaigns you employ. These also make terrificsolo board gamesfor when you don't have a group on hand to spend an hour-plus playing a board game.
Want to skip the blurbs and go straight to the various games and expansions? Scroll through the catalog above. If you're interested in the nitty gritty of how all the items relate to one another and to the broad Arkham Horror universe in general, read on below.
Arkham Horror is acooperative board gamein which player teams work collectively against different sorts of terrors. You can take the journey through Arkham as one of six investigators to solve mysteries and defeat horrific beasts. The game has several campaigns to explore, and given the sizable luck component, whereby you have to roll to see if you pass certain objectives and bosses, along with the chance of chaos and occult trickery, well, the games are highly replayable.
But be warned: this is not an easy game. It takes a bit of time to set up and to teach to your group. The gameplay itself can last for multiple hours, or can be done fairly quickly if you and your ensemble of investigator partners aren’t lucky. (If you or your mates lose and there are fewer players than six, you can select another investigator to play as, but you’ll start over with that one, losing any additional stats that you’ve gained along the way. Dying kinda sucks, to be honest.) My first adventure with friends on the easiest campaign was disastrous. I’ve played it as asolo board game(yep, you can also do that here, too), but that didn’t go well, either. When you complete that first winning game, your whole party will cheer.
There are three expansions for the Arkham Horror: The Board Game. Each unlocks a different layer of depth to the base game.
The largest of the expansions is Under the Dark Waves. As the name suggests, this expansion is about the horrors that exist under the water. This big expansion brings eight new investigators on board for four new scenarios. It takes you out of the city and into the sea.
This is a medium-sized expansion that includes three new scenarios and three more investigators to travel through Arkham. Secrets of the Order opens up another neighborhood, so you'll explore French Hill while being mindful of the ghosts and monsters that may make your visit the opposite of a quaint French getaway.
Dead of Night is a smaller box expansion with a smaller price point to match. It has two more scenarios to add to your base game, plus four more investigators to help you navigate the horrors in the dead of the night.
There are a few other board games that act as their own separate Arkham universes. The games are not directly connected to Arkham Horror, so you don't need that base game to play them. Each of these games allows you and your friends to experience a different, stand-alone adventure within Arkham, using characters you may recognize from other iterations. Some of these titles are big enough to have expansions of their own.
Elder Sign was one of the first games in the Arkham Files franchise. It's adice-rolling board gamethat can be played by one to eight players. Of all the games in the Arkham Files, it’s the most accessible chance game. It is a separate standalone game with six physical companion expansions.
Gameplay is primarily governed by dice. While it’s not entirely like Yahtzee with monsters, rolling dice is the core driver of the game. You’ll have to roll dice to complete tasks and to work through six encounters. You roll dice depending on the stats of your chosen investigator to fight monsters, find clues, and work toward solving the mystery before time runs out.
Elder Sign has six expansions: Unseen Forces, Gates of Arkham, Omens of Ice, Grave Consequences, Omens of the Deep, and Omens of the Pharaoh. Grave Consequences is a standalone deck and can be played with or without the core game. The last expansion was released in 2018. It is currently unknown if there will be any more.
This is an app-drivendungeon crawler board gametake on the universe. The second edition is a standalone game that exists in the same universe as Eldrich Horror and Elder Sign. You can play it with one to five players using an app to help you through the narrative. The app guides you through setting up and playing the game. Narrative, roll results, and play direction can all be done in the app.
Personally, I dug playing with the combination of the tactical pieces and the app. And if you have to pause the game experience, the app allows you to come back later to finish where you left off. You’ll still have to set up your physical board game pieces when you play again, however, so you may want to take a picture to remember where everything should be.
There are two expansions for Mansions of Madness. Both of them are cooperative games that are guided by the app.
This expansion takes you to the depths of the jungle, where serpents and other Lovecraftian horrors will bring peril and pain to your adventure. Like the original, it is guided by an app, and you do need the base game to play it.
This expansion is significantly cheaper than the other one above. Beyond the Threshold opens two new investigators, two new scenarios, and an insanity gameplay element. Its low price point makes it the most accessible expansion to add to your game.
Unfathomable is about escaping a sea of monsters on a boat. It can be played with three to six players, though it’s best suited for groups of five or six. This game has a social deduction component, making it an immersive experience for larger groups. Someone is designated to be a traitor, and you won’t know who. It has Battlestar Galactica vibes to it, but in a Lovecraftian mythos atmosphere. Sessions take multiple hours while you navigate the game trying to figure out who among you is there to help and who wants you dead, while simultaneously trying to escape alive.
Unfathomable is a completely different experience than other games in the Arkham catalogue, making it sort of a love-it-or-hate-it type of deal. If you like Battlestar Galactica or other social deduction games, this may be a good option to explore.
This expansion introduces new prelude cards that offer varied starting conditions, as well as three new monstrous horrors (Shoggoth, the Drowned Spirit, and the Grasping Tendril), plus new skills, items, and boon cards.
Edrich Horror is a different, more worldly experience than the Arkham Horror board game. While Arkham Horror primarily exists in neighborhoods within the city proper (and the sea), Edrich Horror has players navigating cooperatively around the globe to complete objectives. Some have said that Eldrich Horror is like a sequel to a movie.
Some things have been changed and adjusted in Eldrich Horror that make it more accessible to beginner and mid-range gamers. It involves a far quicker setup than Arkham Horror does, which is an immediate plus for gamers who want to get things out and get playing quickly. Eldrich Horror also has simpler rules than Arkham Horror, making the ""teach"" a bit more entry-level-friendly.
That said, Eldrich Horror is more aboutstrategyand solving puzzles. Its first in the series was released in 2013.
There are eight expansions possible to play in Eldrich Horror. Those expansions are Forsaken Lore, Mountains of Madness, Strange Remnants, Under the Pyramids, Signs of Carcosa, The Dreamlands, Cities in Ruin, and Masks of Nyarlathotep.
There are a couple of other ways you can play in the Arkham universe outside of these standard board games. You can play a couple of the board games online. You can also try the franchise's first foray into the world oftabletop roleplaying games.
Arkham Horror released its first TTRPG late last year, with a starter set followed by a rulebook. I recommend trying the starter set first. Once you’ve gotten a feel for the rules and the game, you can choose to grab the rulebook to start your own journey.
The core starter set is super accessible for beginning players. It has a sample campaign to play through for folks who may be new to the TTRPG world, and does not require an experienced Game Master.
Once you've taken the starter set for a spin with your gaming group, you can pick up the Core Rulebook if you want to keep going on new TTRPG adventures in the Arkham Horror universe.
A digital version calledArkham Horror: Mother’s Embracewas released on Steam in 2021. It’s a single-player game that some might find similar to the Mansions of Madness board game expansion. Unfortunately, it only plays as a solo game. If you're open to solo treks into this universe, you can get this digital adventureon Steamoron Switchfor an MSRP of $19.99.
Solo or not, the digital version has gotten mixed reviews. IGN'sArkham Horror: Mother's Embrace reviewscored it a 5 due to lacking story execution. It fumbles with some heavy topics, which may deter some players from enjoying the Lovecraftian mythos.
There is also a digital version of Elder Sign available onSteamand mobile platforms. Elder Sign: Omens was released in 2011, but has received mostly positive reviews on Steam. It's quite affordable at only $5.99.
If you are a fan of Lovecraft mythos-themed games, as I am, Arkham Horror is absolutely worth exploring. One awesome thing is that you can play several of these games solo as well as with friends. They are each different and offer a unique presentation of the Lovecraftian worlds.
That said, these games are on the more difficult side. They have quite a bit of chance, which can drastically increase replayability as well as frustration. Setup and learning time can also take some time. You’ll find that the card games are easier to set up than the board games, even without expansions.

"No video games for you!Superbadco-writerSeth Rogenhas revealed that Sony foundJonah Hill's character so ""reprehensible"" that reps insisted he stay away from aPlayStationduring a video game scene in the now-beloved comedy.

“On Superbad, we were told that Jonah Hill’s character, Seth, was so reprehensible to the studio that they were like, there’s a scene where they’re playing video games and [Sony] was like, ‘Jonah can’t touch a PlayStation,’ ” Rogen told Rotten Tomatoes in a South By Southwest 2025 red carpet video.
“They were like, ‘We can’t have him interact with our products, because it’s too vile a character.’ And I was like, ‘It’s based on me, that’s very insulting.’ But we accommodated them, ultimately.”
Sony Pictures co-financed the film, so they had a lot of leverage over a few top-notch comics trying to make a generational comedy. Ultimately, instead of Hill’s Seth keysmashing his controller and yelling at the TV screen when he died in-game, Michael Cera’s character Evan can be seen playingThe Getaway: Black Mondayon PS2 in that scene. But fun fact: there’s actually a bit of a gag with one of Cera’s lines here. He mentions using an M16 assault rifle in the game — but The Getaway: Black Monday, a British cop game, doesn’t even include them in the weapons arsenal. Go figure.
Rogen was at SXSW to promote his new Apple TV+ seriesThe Studio, which had its world premiere at the festival just days ago.
Superbad also starred Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Emma Stone, alongside memorable cameos from Bill Hader and Rogen himself. Rogen co-wrote the script with Evan Goldberg and Greg Mottola directed.

"One of the reasons the MCU has been so successful over the years is that this shared universe leans heavily on the comic book source material. These movies aren’t usually direct adaptations of any one comic, but they always draw on iconic storylines and runs and make that classic material accessible to a wider audience. Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars will be no exceptions. These upcoming movies are inspired by both the original 1984 crossover Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars and 2015’s Secret Wars.

More From the MCU:How Many Minutes of Screen Time Can Each Avenger Really Get in Doomsday?
But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Now that we know themain cast of Avengers: Doomsday, we’re getting a clearer picture of which Marvel Comics storylines are inspiring this epic MCU adventure. From epic crossovers likeAvengers vs. X-Mento the debut of the Illuminati to two different versions of Secret Wars, these are the 75 Marvel comics that give us a better idea of whatAvengers: DoomsdayandAvengers: Secret Warsare about.
As seen in:The Avengers Vol. 5 #35-44, New Avengers Vol. 3 #24-33 (2015)
Again, Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars are heavily inspired by the two Secret Wars comics. This much we know from Kevin Feige and the Russo Bros. themselves, who are coming back to Marvel direct the films. But while we’ll get to Secret Wars itself in a bit, it’s worth starting out by focusing on the long, dramatic buildup to the 2015 comics version. That storyline, Avengers: Time Runs Out, will probably end up informing the plot of Doomsday as much as anything else.
From the beginning, Jonathan Hickman’s Avengers and New Avengers titles deal with the concept ofIncursions, that phenomenon where two parallel versions of Earth begin to collide and threaten to annihilate both universes unless one of the Earths is destroyed. The Incursions are revealed to be a symptom of a larger disease in the Marvel multiverse, one that seems destined to end in the complete obliteration of all existence.
Time Runs Out takes place in a particularly dire period for the Marvel Universe. Incursions are occurring more and more frequently, making the fight to stop them and save Earth-616 truly an existential crisis. Unfortunately, Time Runs Out also occurs in a period when the Avengers are more divided than they’ve been since the events of 2006’s Civil War. Once again, there are basically two opposing factions in this ideological battle. One law-abiding team of Avengers serves under S.H.I.E.L.D., while another group follows the Illuminati and their more pragmatic approach to survival.
Of course, Time Runs Out is more than just an Avengers story. Members of the X-Men and Fantastic Four also play key roles. And then there’s Doctor Doom. Doom is revealed to be a pivotal player in the conflict, as he takes on a new identity as Rabum Alal and attracts a cabal of fanatical followers. Doom’s war with the extra-dimensional entities known as The Beyonders is the source of the multiverse’s impending collapse. He sees himself as the savior of existence. Others might disagree.
We’ve already seen some plot threads inspired by Time Runs Out crop up during the Multiverse Saga. Thanks to thepost-credits scene in 2022’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, we know Benedict Cumberbatch’s Stephen Strange has joined forces with Charlize Theron’s Clea to investigate the Incursion problem. And an Incursion forms the crux of the climax of 2023’s The Marvels, resulting in Teyonah Parris’ Monica Rambeau becoming stranded on Earth-10005, a world whereKelsey Grammer’s Beast and the rest of the X-Menare making their own stand against Incursions.
If Avengers: Doomsday is an adaptation of any one Marvel story, it’s definitely going to be Time Runs Out. We’re sure to see the Incursion problem reach critical mass, prompting a desperate race to stave off the end of all things. Like in the comic, we may see the Avengers split down the middle in how they deal with this threat. Though in this case, we suspect we’ll see one team rally around Anthony Mackie’s Captain America and another around Robert Downey, Jr.’s Doctor Doom. And again, we’ll see the Fantastic Four and the X-Men drawn into the fray as everyone races to save their respective world. But if Doomsday is anything like the comic, it’s all going to be for naught in the end.
As seen in:New Avengers - The Illuminati #1-5 (2006)
In the buildup to Marvel’s Civil War crossover, readers first met the Illuminati, a shadowy group that included Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Mister Fantastic, Namor, Black Bolt, and Professor X. It was revealed that this group has been quietly manipulating events in the Marvel Universe for years, always in the name of protecting Earth from threats both within and without. Marvel’s New Avengers: The Illuminati miniseries explores the group’s actions in much greater depth.
Though they eventually disbanded, the Illuminati were reformed in Hickman’s Avengers run. The slightly revamped roster included new members like Black Panther, Beast, and Hulk (who was going through an unusually intelligent phase at the time). The Illuminati are also prominent players in Time Runs Out, resorting to questionable measures to protect Earth-616 from Incursions.
We already met one version of the Illuminati in the MCU in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, a group based on Earth-838. Unfortunately for them, they didn’t survive their run-in with Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch.
But could we meet the Earth-616 version of the Illuminati in Avengers: Doomsday? It’s hard not to come to that conclusion based solely on the cast list. What happens when you get Patrick Stewart’s Professor X, Pedro Pascal’s Reed Richards, Tenoch Huerta Mejía’s Namor, and Letitia Wright’s Black Panther in the same room? We even have to wonder if Downey’s Doom could take the place of Tony Stark here. As in the comic, we may see the Illuminati stoop to any and all measures to save their universe, even if it means damning themselves in the process.
As seen in:Avengers vs. X-Men #1-12 (2012)
Normally, the Avengers and X-Men are allies in the never-ending fight to defend the Marvel Universe. But the two teams became bitter enemies in 2012’s Avengers vs. X-Men storyline.
AvX comes at the tail end of a long period where the X-Men are fighting a losing battle to protect the mutant race from extinction. When it becomes apparent that the Phoenix Force is back and making a beeline for Earth, the X-Men see it as their last, best hope to restore the mutant population. The Avengers, however, see the Phoenix Force as a clear and present threat to everyone on Earth. That’s when the two teams come to blows.
We’ve already done a deep dive into Avengers vs. X-Men andthe ways in which it could inspire Avengers: Doomsday, but the gist is that we could see a very different take in the MCU on the concept of the two teams going to war. We’re not expecting a close adaptation of the comic book crossover, as the X-Men haven’t even been properly established in the MCU yet.
Instead, we think Doomsday’s AvX conflict would involve the multiverse. It stands to reason that Grammer is reprising the same version of Beast we saw in The Marvels’ post-credits scene, and that all the other X-Men confirmed for the film are residents of that same world, which we’re assuming is Earth-10005, a.k.a. the Fox X-Men movie universe. Eventually, Earth-616 and Earth-10005 will be linked together by an Incursion, forcing the MCU’s Avengers to battle the Fox universe’s X-Men for the fate of their respective worlds.
In that sense, the Avengers vs. X-Men conflict in Doomsday will probably be less inspired by the AvX crossover than it will the first chapter of 2015’s Secret Wars comic. In Secret Wars #1, the Marvel multiverse is reduced to just two remaining universes, the classic Marvel Universe and the Ultimate Universe. The Avengers and Ultimates go to war as the final Incursion breaks out, only for both worlds to be annihilated in the end. Doomsday may very well end in a similar battle between the Avengers and X-Men. Instead of working together to save the multiverse, they’ll be too busy fighting each other. And that’s where Secret Wars comes in.
As seen in:Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #1-12 (1984), Secret Wars #1-9 (2015)
At this point, we might as well talk about Secret Wars proper and how it’s likely to influence both Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars. As we mentioned earlier, Marvel has published two separate but not entirely unconnected Secret Wars comics, the first in 1984 and the second in 2015. The Russos have confirmed that both comics are an influence on their upcoming Avengers movies, though we’re definitely sensing more of the latter Secret Wars so far.
In the original Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars, a who’s who lineup of Marvel heroes and villains are abducted by a godlike being known as The Beyonder. He whisks them away to an artificial planet called Battleworld to fight for his amusement. In the end, Doom steals The Beyonder’s power for himself, temporarily achieving the strength to match his boundless ego. Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars is also notable for introducing Spider-Man’s black costume and paving the way for Venom.
2015’s Secret Wars, meanwhile, serves as the climax of Hickman’s sprawling Avengers run. We’ve already covered how the first issue features a desperate, doomed battle between two teams of heroes as the multiverse collapses around them. But the real meat of Secret Wars is in what happens next.
Even as the multiverse itself dies, Doom and his ally Molecule Man (a key player in the original Secret Wars crossover) make their final stand against The Beyonders. Doom steals their power and becomes omnipotent. He uses his newfound power to form a new Battleworld out of the broken fragments of dozens of dead universes. Doom then crowns himself God Emperor of Battleworld, with each realm controlled by a different Baron. It’s sort of the Marvel version of Dune or Game of Thrones.
As Secret Wars unfolds, Doom fights to hold his new kingdom together while a group of refugees from Earth-616 seeks a way to restore the multiverse. Fittingly, it all comes down to a final confrontation between God Emperor Doom and his greatest rival, Reed Richards. Even as a god, Doom can’t move past his hatred for Reed and his own self-loathing.
We don’t know how much, if at all, we’re going to see the two Secret Wars storylines adapted in Doomsday, but Avengers: Secret Wars is shaping up to be a fairly close adaptation of those comics. Once again, we’re expecting to see Downey’s Doom achieve ultimate power and form Battleworld out of the ashes of the multiverse. We’ll probably see a great many realms inspired by both the comics and various Marvel movies of years past. We’ll almost certainly see a motley team of heroes band together to restore the multiverse, including both MCU mainstays and iconic movie favorites like Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine and Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man. If you’re wondering how Marvel could ever top the fanboy glee of the portals sequence from Endgame, that’s how.
As seen in:Marvel Graphic Novel #27 - Emperor Doom (1987)
While the MCU is definitely drawing a lot of inspiration from Hickman’s Avengers run and Secret Wars for its portrayal of Doctor Doom, it’s worth taking a look at a much older story that also revolves around Doom crowning himself emperor. That story is 1987’s Emperor Doom graphic novel.
Emperor Doom shows us what happens when Doom finally grows tired of ruling one measly country and sets his sights on the entire planet. After harnessing the mind-controlling powers of Purple Man, Doom brainwashes the nations of the world into accepting him as their monarch. With no one to oppose him, Doom ushers in a new era of peace and prosperity. Life under Emperor Doom is actually pretty swell, so long as you don’t mind the total lack of free will. It falls on Wonder Man to free the Avengers and mount a resistance against Emperor Doom.
Marvel is also currently exploring a similar concept in the One World Under Doom crossover, which again sees Doom crown himself Emperor of a surprisingly docile and grateful planet.
Could we see elements of Emperor Doom when it comes to Downey’s version of the iconic villain? It’s definitely possible. The Russos have made it clear that Doom is someone who sees himself as the hero of his own story. He thinks he’s doing what has to be done to save the Marvel multiverse. Maybe we’ll see him crown himself emperor in Avengers: Doomsday, rallying the entire world to his cause. We suspect a great many people in the MCU would be only too happy to pledge their life to a guy with Tony Stark’s face.
As seen in:Infamous Iron Man #1-12 (2016)
To be honest, we’re still trying to wrap our heads around the surprise reveal thatDowney has been cast as Doctor Doom. Why bring back the most recognizable MCU actor to play a completely different character? What’s the significance of the fact that Doom looks like Tony Stark? Is he a version of Tony from another universe where things worked out differently, or is he merely using Tony’s face to further his own agenda?
Those are all questions we probably won’t see answered until Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters. But it certainly can’t hurt to look at one of the comics that explores the Iron Man/Doctor Doom relationship in greater depth.
For that, we recommend looking at 2016’s Infamous Iron Man, part of Brian Michael Bendis' larger Invincible Iron Man run. This series is set after the events of 2015’s Secret Wars. No longer a God Emperor, Victor von Doom has been healed in body and soul. He’s determined to prove himself a hero worthy of the mantle of Iron Man. And because Tony Stark himself is comatose at this point, there’s no one to actually stop Doom from giving it an honest go.
Will Infamous Iron Man have a direct influence on Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars? It’s hard to say. Though, if nothing else, we wouldn’t be surprised if the MCU draws on Doom’s character design in this series as it introduces a Tony Stark-ified version of Doctor Doom. Downey’s character may look less like the traditional Doom than he does this version that wears a silver and green Iron Man armor.
But again, we know that Downey’s character is someone who sees himself as being in the right. Doom firmly believes he’s the hero. There may be elements of Infamous Iron Man that work their way into that portrayal of Doom. He’s a character who needs to win hearts and minds if he’s going to carry out his plan of saving the multiverse.
As seen in:Fantastic Four - 1 2 3 4 (2002)
With all the spectacle and cosmic stakes going on in these next two Avengers movies, it’s all the more important they find time to focus on the smaller character moments. They need to be perfectly balanced enough to satisfy even Thanos himself. Avengers: Infinity War accomplished that task by giving us moments of levity between Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Doctor Strange and zeroing in on the doomed romance between Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch and Paul Bettany’s Vision. Endgame was basically one long fat joke at the expense of Chris Hemsworth’s Thor.
How will Avengers: Doomsday lighten the mood? We suspect that’s going to fall on Namor’s brawny shoulders. Anyone who’s read a Fantastic Four comic featuring Namor will know that the King of Atlantis has the hots for Susan Storm. Heck, he makes Wolverine’s deep infatuation with Jean Grey seem normal by comparison. Sue, for her part, has never really reciprocated Namor’s love over the years, but that’s never stopped his incessant flirtation. Hey, he’s a fish king. He’s not used to being told no.
Given that Doomsday is the first MCU movie to include both Vanessa Kirby’s Sue and Tenoch Huerta Mejía’s Namor, we can only assume we’re going to see this sexual tension play out on the big screen. Expect some of the movie’s more comedic moments to come as Namor woos Sue and she rebuffs his advances. As for Pedro Pascal’s Reed? If he’s anything like the comic book version, he may be too oblivious to notice. Sue may wind up leading Namor on just to get a rise out of her single-minded science dork of a husband.
Again, there are any number of comics the movie could draw from in this area. Namor’s unrequited love for Sue goes back a long time. But if Doomsday pulls from any one FF comic, we’d guess it would be 2002’s Fantastic Four: 1 2 3 4. That book, which is unusually dark for an FF story, may be the closest Sue has ever come to actually responding to Namor’s advances. 1 2 3 4 is also a very Doom-centric story, so that makes it all the more likely the screenwriters might have consulted this hidden gem of a Marvel comic.
And there you have it. If you want to do your homework before Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters in May 2026, you know what to read. But what Marvel storylines do you most want to see adapted in these next two Avengers movies? Let us know in the comments."

"Pokémon Go, alongside Niantic's broader gaming division, was recently acquired by mobile gaming juggernaut Scopely. The $3.5 billion sale has players a little worried about what it means for the walk-around monster-catching game, and its director is trying to assuage those fears.

In anew interview with Polygon, Pokémon Go senior product director Michael Steranka discussed the sale to Scopely and what its plans are under theMonopoly Go!publisher. Steranka said he's been looking online at some of the player theories. ""What I would love to be able to get across is like, 'Hey, it’s actually great,'"" Steranka said. ""It’s going to be a good thing for the game and for the communities out there.""
Concerns over Pokémon Go's futurerun the gamut, from monetization and mechanics to influence from Saudi-based ownership. When asked about the potential for intrusive ads and playtime restrictions, Steranka said ""definitively no, that is not happening in Pokémon Go — not now, not ever.""
""Again, Scopely really recognizes how unique this game is, and they’ve told us themselves that they would be foolish to try to change the recipe of what’s made this such a huge hit and a success,"" Steranka insisted.
""So yeah, absolutely not. We will not be building into our games any type of obtrusive ads or anything like that. I just really want to reiterate Scopely as a company, the way that they operate is they give all of their teams the agency to make the decisions that’s right for their games. And that is not something that we feel would ever be right for Pokémon Go.""
Steranka went on to stress that the Go team does not sell player data to third parties, ""full stop,"" and that it only leverages location data for game operations, with any data needed stored on U.S.-based servers and following all ""incredibly strict"" regulatory best practicies as best it can.
Getting out and going outside will remain a core focus, too, even after leaving Niantic: ""And I would be remiss if through this transaction, Pokémon Go became Pokémon Stay at Home,"" Steranka said.

"TheNvidia GeForce RTX 5090launched back in January and easily became the most powerfuldesktop graphics cardon the market. Now, a few months later, Nvidia has launched its Blackwell architecture for laptops, and while these mobileNvidia GPUsare nowhere near as powerful as their desktop counterparts, they do deliver an incredible gaming experience, especially on high-end gaming laptops with high-refresh displays.

However, just like Nvidia’s latest line of desktop graphics cards, the generational improvement in pure performance isn’t nearly as pronounced as it’s been in previous generations. That’s offset a bit in games that support features like Multi-Frame Generation, of course, but it does mean that anyone who already has a decent gaming laptop doesn’t need to sweat upgrading their setup for this new generation.
While the GPU in the Razer Blade 16 I tested is called an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, it’s a far cry from the desktop version of the GPU with the same name. Just by virtue of space and thermal constraints, the mobile version of the RTX 5090 needs to be much smaller: Instead of the 21,760 CUDA cores in the desktop version of the card, the mobile 5090 is limited to 10,496 cores across 82 Streaming Multiprocessors. That’s less than half the silicon, and places the RTX 5090 mobile closer to the desktop RTX 5080.
But it’s more than just the size of the chip – laptops are a lot more power-constrained than a desktop, too, by virtue of needing to operate on a battery or via a portable power brick. The system I tested the RTX 5090 Mobile with had the GPU limited to 160W, which is a little over aquarterof the power of its desktop counterpart. That has a huge impact on gaming performance, since a general rule of thumb is that more power = better performance.
However, compared to the previous-generation Razer Blade 16 with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, the new mobile chip has been beefed up a bit. The RTX 4090 packed 9,728 CUDA cores across 76 Streaming Multiprocessors, at the same 160W power budget. That’s about a 7.4% increase in the amount of cores, which is a minor increase, but it lines up extremely well with the performance increase you can expect from the RTX 5090.
Keep in mind, though, that with laptop graphics, it’s largely up to the laptop manufacturer how much power and cooling a GPU has access to. There may be some gaming laptops with an RTX 5090 configured to run with as little as 95W. The laptop I tested had it configured for 160W, which is above the maximum listed TGP (total graphics power) specified by Nvidia. The point is, your mileage may vary, as a 95W RTX 5090 is going to be much weaker than one running on 150W.
Each Streaming Multiprocessor is architected a bit differently than the RTX 4090 too. Just like the desktop version, the RTX 5090 Mobile is based on the new Blackwell architecture, which places special emphasis on AI computation – after all this is the same architecture powering most cutting-edge supercomputers right now. The new Tensor Cores, combined with a new AI Management Processor, or AMP, allow the GPU to do much more complex AI workloads, and is the driving force behind multi-frame generation.
Nvidia has also made an effort to improve battery life, which has never been a strong point for gaming laptops. It’s done this by improving Nvidia Optimus, a technology that dynamically switches between discrete and integrated graphics depending on what you’re doing. But Team Green has also implemented something called “Battery Boost”, which should improve gaming performance when you’re not plugged into the wall. Basically, Nvidia is using an algorithm to detect what’s going on in the game you’re playing and adjusting performance accordingly. For example, it’ll lower GPU clocks when you’re in a dialogue scene, and push more performance when you actually need it.
Just like its desktop counterpart, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 Mobile doesn’t have the strongest generational improvement over its predecessor. On average, I found that the RTX 5090 was about 8% faster than theRTX 4090. The performance gap was a bit better in workloads like 3DMark, but for the most part it doesn’t deliver much better gaming performance, at least before Frame Generation is brought into the equation.
To be clear, testing laptop graphics performance is a bit more complicated than testing a desktop graphics card, especially across generations. The Razer Blade 16 that Nvidia sent me for this architecture review is sporting an AMD Ryzen 9 AI HX 370, while the previous-gen Razer Blade 16 I used for testing the RTX 4090 has an Intel Core i9-13950HX – twoverydifferent processors. Plus, the chassis design has changed completely, and while we have a full review on the laptop coming later, the new design is much thinner and lighter, which calls into question thermal constraints.
However, throughout my testing, I didn’t notice the RTX 5090 being thermal- or power-limited in any way, even if the RTX 4090 was able to stretch a little above the 160W power limit – though not by much. So, while my initial results point to the RTX 5090 being on average 8% faster than the RTX 4090, there is enough variability here to take the numbers with a bit of a grain of salt. We’ll have a clearer picture of what this GPU can do as more laptop designs head to market over the next year or so.
In 3DMark, the new RTX 5090 Mobile was 12% faster than the RTX 4090 in Speed Way, and 16% faster in Steel Nomad. These are both DirectX 12 tests, and indicate potential performance more than anything.
When it comes to actual games, the performance differences are much less pronounced. For instance, inCall of Duty: Black Ops 6at 1600p, the RTX 5090 Mobile system got 107 fps, compared to 106 fps from the RTX 4090. That’s just a 1% improvement and totally within the margin of error.
Things look a little better inCyberpunk 2077,where the RTX 5090 Mobile manages 67 fps to the 4090’s 62 fps, making for an 8% improvement. That’s decent, and it’s important to note that this is without Frame Generation, which will further increase the 5090’s lead in frame rate.
I testedMetro Exodus: Enhanced Editionwith no upscaling, to give an idea of what to expect from pure ray tracing performance. In this game, the RTX 5090 gets 61 fps at 1600p with the Extreme Preset, compared to 56 fps from the RTX 4090, that’s a 9% improvement, lining up with the increase in CUDA cores almost exactly.
Red Dead Redemption 2is a weird case, as it puts the RTX 5090behindthe RTX 4090 at 1600p with DLSS set to Balanced. The newer GPU gets 89 fps, compared to 93 from the RTX 4090, which is about a 4% drop. However, this is likely due to the CPU not being able to keep up.
Total War: Warhammer 3 is a good way to gauge pure rasterization performance, as it eschews any ray tracing or upscaling technologies. In this game, the RTX 5090 is about 6% faster than the 4090. Though this may be another case where the CPU is holding the 5090 back.
In Assassins Creed Mirage, the GeForce RTX 5090 is able to soar with 107 fps at 1600p with everything maxed and with DLSS set to Balanced. However, that’s only 4% faster than the RTX 4090 with the same settings.
Then, in Black Myth: Wukong, a game that’s extremely GPU-heavy, the GeForce RTX 5090 gets 63 fps on average, which is only 5% faster than the 4090’s 60 fps average. This is one of the games that showed the strongest uplift for the RTX 5090 on desktop, so it's especially damning here.
Even for creators, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 for laptops isn’t a huge improvement. In Blender, the RTX 5090 Mobile is only 9% faster than the RTX 4090 in the Monster benchmark. Blender performance usually gets better over time, but it’s something to keep in mind.
The main reason the desktop version of the RTX 5090 had a large lead over its predecessor was because it had a much higher power budget – 575W vs 450W. With the RTX 5090 and RTX 4090 having the same 160W power limit, we see similar results to other RTX 5000 graphics cards. Chips like the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5080 had very modest improvements over their predecessors, which also had similar power requirements. At least when it comes to traditional gaming performance, Blackwell seems to be an architecture that is extremely dependent on power, so it shouldn’t be surprising that laptop performance doesn’t scale as well as Nvidia’s desktop cards.
The biggest difference between the RTX 5090 and its predecessor is DLSS 4, and specifically multi-frame generation, or MFG. DLSS 4 does also include improvements that are available on previous-generation GPUs, like moving AI upscaling from a convolutional neural network (CNN) to a Transformer network. This greatly improves accuracy and image quality, whether you’re using the RTX 5090 or an older RTX graphics card.
However, multi-frame generation really is the star of the show, particularly on the Razer Blade 16 with its 240Hz display.
Just like the previous version of frame generation that debuted with DLSS 3, MFG uses the Tensor Cores to generate frames between natively rendered frames. It then uses the new AI Management Processor to pace out the frames to minimize latency and other weirdness. Frame pacing is a task that has traditionally been handled by the CPU, so the AMP is especially needed to cut down on system latency when the GPU is magically creating three frames in between each rendered one.
For a high refresh display, though, this is an awesome feature. It doesn’t improve latency or anything, but it does make the gameplaylooka lot smoother, which is really all you need in single-player games like Assassins Creed Shadows. Just don’t expect it to magically improve your response times if you enable it in an online shooter likeMarvel RivalsorFragpunk.
Nvidia claims that MFG can triple frame rates, but it’s important to keep in mind that there’s a catch: you need to already have a good frame rate to get a good experience from frame generation. I wouldn’t recommend any kind of frame generation unless you’re already getting 50-60 fps without it. Below that, you’re basically asking for weird artifacts to show up as the algorithm struggles to track objects between frames.
If you do already have a good frame rate though, MFG really does boost frame rates by a huge margin, even if it does come with a slight cost to latency. For instance, in Cyberpunk 2077 with the Ray Tracing Overdrive preset and with DLSS set to balanced with no frame generation, the Razer Blade 16 managed an average of 51 fps at 1600p. That came with latency around 47ms, which isn’tgreat, but still more than playable. When I turned frame generation to 2x, that frame rate jumps all the way up to 96 fps, with the latency going up to 53ms. That’s a huge improvement to framerate, and the latency cost really isn’tthat high. The latency cost is a bit greater with MFG, as turning it up to 4x increases average latency to 59ms – though the framerate jumps to 170 fps.
It’s a similar story inStar Wars Outlaws. At 1600p with DLSS set to balanced, the RTX 5090 Mobile gets around 61 fps on average, with an average latency around 36ms. With 2x frame generation the frame rate goes up to 115 fps, with latency also increasing to 45ms. The jump up to 4x frame generation only brings the latency up to 48ms, but bumps the frame rate up to 210 fps, which is getting extremely close to the laptop’s native refresh rate of 240 Hz.
Realistically, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 is going to primarily be found in high-end gaming laptops with high resolution displays with high refresh rates. That’s exactly where multi frame generation shines, and it’s awesome to finally be able to take advantage of these super-fast laptop screens. Still, if you’re someone who is sensitive to latency or if you play competitive games, it might not be worth enabling.

If you already have a decent gaming laptop, you really shouldn’t look at the RTX 5090 twice. It doesn’t deliver much of an improvement over its last-generation counterpart, which remains excellent. However, if you’ve been waiting to upgrade to a high-end gaming laptop for a while, features like multi-frame generation and battery boost will make premium laptops powered by Nvidia’s latest even better."
"Hot on the heels ofits announcement of new game Project C4, ZA/UM has announced an official mobile version of Disco Elysium.

ZA/UM said its goal for the mobile version, exclusive to Android devices, is to bring Disco Elysium to new players “and hopefully serve existing Disco Elysium players with a fun, on-the-go alternative.” To this end, it will release the first two chapters of Disco Elysium for mobile free of charge. You can then pay once to unlock the full game, ad-free.
“We want players to make an informed decision about their potential purchase,” ZA/UM said. “Today’s ZA/UM studio is comprised of both creators and custodians of the Disco Elysium IP. We take both of those roles very seriously and we believe that is evident in the Disco Elysium mobile experience we are creating.”
Studio head Denis Havel went one step further and said Disco Elysium on mobile is about attracting the TikTok audience.
“We intend to captivate the TikTok user with quick hits of compelling story, art, and audio, ultimately creating an all new, deeply engaging form of entertainment,” Havel said.
ZA/UM’s announcement came alongside a debut trailer for Disco Elysium on mobile, as well as screenshots. The game has new, 360-degree scenes built “exclusively to place the mobile user right in the middle of Revachol.” There’s brand new audio featuring full voiceover that “serves to deliver a more immersive, even more character-rich experience.”
Here’s the official blurb:
Narrative Lead Chris Priestman said Disco Elysium’s mobile version is “what audiobooks wish they were,” and is designed to be played in short bursts.
Disco Elysium released on mobile via Google Android summer 2025.
It is of course worth noting that while the studio name is the same, many of the key people who worked on Disco Elysium are not at ZA/UM.Numerous former ZA/UM members have left the studio since Disco Elysium's release, and some of those are working on spiritual successors.

"Speculation thatStarfieldwill soon be confirmed for release on PlayStation 5 ramped up over the weekend after fans spotted a PlayStation logo on Bethesda’s official Creations website.

The logo was attached to a work-in-progress ship decals Creation for Starfield, and although the Creation was removed, fans are speculating that Bethesda’s so-far PC and Xbox-only sci-fi game is soon set for PS5.
Thoughts inevitably turn to whether Bethesda plans a significant content update, possibly even a new expansion, to coincide with Starfield’s seemingly inevitable release on PS5. There’s been little to shout about when it comes to Starfield in recent months, following the launch of the poorly receivedShattered Space expansion. Bethesda parent company Microsoft is expected to hold another summer showcase this year, as it has done in recent years, and that event may be the right time and place to learn more about all things Starfield.
Bethesda itself has said it has ""exciting things"" planned for Starfield this year, amid growing discontent from players about a lack of communication and updates. In June 2024,Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supportingStarfield, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. In an interview withYouTube channel MrMattyPlays, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”
Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new intellectual property in years, and its first mainline single-player game since Microsoft bought parent company ZeniMax Media in March 2021. IGN’sStarfield reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist.”
In January,Microsoft’s gaming boss Phil Spencer refused to rule out Starfield coming out on PS5.Starfield and MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were both reported as being considered for PS5 as far back as March 2024. Indy ended up confirmed for PS5 with a spring 2025 release window, a few months after its release on PC and Xbox Series X and S. But Starfield is yet to be confirmed for PS5, although Spencer's comments certainly suggested it was on the cards.
A number of Xbox games are currently available on PS5, including Rare’s Sea of Thieves, Tango Gameworks’ Hi-Fi Rush, and Obsidian’s Grounded and Pentiment. Microsoft already publishes Minecraft games on PlayStation consoles, among many other platforms, and is set to publish Doom: The Dark Ages and Ninja Gaiden 4 on PS5 later this year. Playground’s Forza Horizon 5 is also confirmed as coming to PS5 soon. There are even reports thatMicrosoft is finally ready to release Halo on PlayStation after decades of Xbox exclusivity.
Spencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.
“We run a business,”Spencer said in August last year. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.
“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”
It’s a busy time for the 450-person Bethesda Game Studios, which currently operates five teams: Starfield; Elder Scrolls 6; Fallout 76; mobile; and external development partnerships.

"Fans quick to celebrate the reveal of a Microsoft Flight Simulator PlayStation Store page were left let down after it was discovered that the actual product is little more than “copycat shovelware.”

Xbox and PlayStation fans gathered to discuss a potential port for the popular flight simulation game afterReddit user CreativeRaspberry314 sharedTrophy information related to a potential PS4 and PS5 version earlier today. It would be exciting – ifnot somewhat unsurprising– to see Microsoft bring more Xbox titles to PlayStation fans, butthe spotted store pageisn’t officially related to Microsoft Flight Simulator in any way, shape, or form.
“Sadly, this is just a copycat shovelware game,” oneReddit user added. “Straight up shovelware,” anotheradded. “Actually mental tbh, the picture is a straight up rip-off. If it was MSFS, it'd have the same achievements as the Xbox/Steam versions.”
Instead, the Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation is being published by a company named Grizzly Games Limited. As spotted byEurogamer, the company shares a name with Thronefall developer Grizzly Games but is also completely unrelated to that entity. While that team is responsible for other titles like Superflight and Islanders, theGrizzly Games Limited websitereveals a catalog of what appear to be mobile games featuring glossy, AI-generated materials. The art for its Flight Simulator 2025 project also appears to be generated by AI judging by some of its muddy plane parts and strange designs.
The Thronefall team, meanwhile, provided a statement to Eurogamer related to the discovery of Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation and Grizzly Games Limited. Grizzly Games says it is not associated with the company, adding that it is using “both our name and logo illegally.”
“Furthermore they seem to incorporate the absolute opposite of our values, of what we stand for and what we’re trying to give to the gaming community,” Grizzly Games continued. “Unfortunately our legal resources are limited as a two-person indie team, but honestly I'd love to see this kind of stuff being stopped, especially since it's not only happening to us but lots of indie devs that just lack the legal power.""
As of this story’s publication, the Flight Simulator 2025 page remains live on the PlayStation Store. It describes an experience that “sets a new standard in aviation simulation, combining ultra-realistic flight dynamics with breathtaking visuals.” No gameplay for the project has been revealed.
“Can shovelware just be banned from the store please? It’s packed to the brim with it and makes browsing an absolute chore,” anotherReddit user added. “I don’t remember it being this bad in prior generations.”
PlayStationtook a standagainst what many refer to as “spam” titles in 2022. At the time, it was believed the move was made to fight back against easy-to-Platinum games, or titles that exist almost solely for the purpose of increasing players’ Platinum Trophy count. However, many shovelware titles still exist on the PlayStation Store andother digital storefrontstoday.
Webrought a magnifying glass up to the issue last monthto take a closer look at how shovelware titles impact both gamers and developers. We spoke to multiple developers to learn more about not only how these games find their way onto digital storefronts but PlayStation, Nintendo, Xbox, and Valve’s vetting process.

"A video purportedly taken from the next iteration of The Sims has popped up online, and fans have expressed their concern about what it may mean for the much-loved series.

Project Rene- the codename sometimes used interchangeably with The Sims 5, although EA maintains Project Rene is, in fact, a spin-off project - has been bubbling around for a few years now, but early access footage from a game entitled ""City Life Game With Friends"" has many players thinking that this could well be the next Sims game.
The video itselfis a full 20 minutes long and shows the player clicking through text prompts to select their outfit, hair, watch, activities, and so on. He then spawns into a sunlit Plaza de Poupon where he buys some food and mingles with the locals. He later goes to work in the outdoor café.
Characters are clearly called Sims throughout the playtest, talk in Simlish, and are adorned with The Sims' tell-tale Plumbob.
""I am terribly disappointed with Project Rene. Yes, I know, according to EA, 'this is not the final game.' Is this a joke or what?""said one unhappy playeron The Sims' subreddit on a post entitled ""I think Project Rene is a redflag (I hope not)"" that has been upvoted hundreds of times.
""EA clearly wants to kill off normal Sims games and push people toward the mobile-style experience. So in their mind, a reboot literally means this — at least that’s what I THINK.""
""This is not going to be for me, I can tell already,"" saidanother. ""It just seems so basic and I don't want to play The Sims on my phone.""
""The funny thing is, making a PC/mobile cross-compatible Sims game isn't a bad idea,""positeda fan. ""EA just believes that mobile games HAVE to be ugly for some reason. They're chasing all of the design trends of the past decade, but it means that this thing already looks dated and it's not even out yet.""
""The way The Sims was a literally [sic] satire about capitalist suburban consumption-as-happiness.... And this is where the Sims ended up. Endless consumption-as-happiness,""suggestedanother.
Project Rene — the codenamed game initially thought to be The Sims 5 until EA distanced itself from those rumors —was first teased in 2022during a Behind the Sims Summit. It's afree-to-playSims game that featuresmultiplayer inspired by Animal Crossing and Among Us. It hasn't yet been formally revealed or received a release date, but EA has been holding small,invite-only playtests for the gamesince its announcement, with the game's latest playtest presumably spawning these recent leaks.
The name Rene was chosen because it references words like ""renewal, renaissance, and rebirth"" that ""represent the developer's renewed commitment for the Sims' bright future.""
Last October, however,images of Project Rene leakedfrom a closed online test, prompting complaints about the art style, limited features, and the use of microtransactions. It was the addition of a café that drew the most skepticism, primarily due to the smiliaries to 2018's The Sims Mobile. It was then that EA said Project Rene was not The Sims 5 but would, in fact, be a different ""cosy, social game"" released under The Sims franchise.
Don't forget that The Burglar, a familiar sight for those of us who've spent time with any of the older Sims gamessnuck back into our livesas part of the latest update forThe Sims 4.

"PlayStation or Xbox? It’s the long-running question of the modern video game world. At one point or another in your life, you’ve almost certainly been a part of this debate. Maybe you’ve started a Reddit thread, or made a TikTok video, or struck up a heated chat between friends about it. While therearegamers who preach the PC gospel, and Nintendo-as-god fanatics, much of the last two decades of video game history has been made as a result of Sony and Microsoft’s ongoing tete-a-tete. But is this ‘console war’ truly still being waged? The video game industry has gone through immense change in the last year, let alone over the previous two decades. Gamers’ habits, preferences, and options have all increased exponentially in part thanks to the rise of handheld gaming and younger generations’ expertise in building their own gaming machines. The battlefield is now practically unrecognisable compared to its tribal-like origins, but has a victor finally emerged from the trenches? Possibly – but the answer may surprise you.

The video game industry has rapidly evolved to become a financial juggernaut in recent years. In 2019, its worldwide revenue was $285 billion. Last year, it was $475 billion. That figure means that video games made more than the entire world wide movie and music industries in 2023, which made$308 billionand$28.6 billionrespectively. There’s no sign of this growth stopping, either. By 2029, the industry is estimated to generate nearly$700 billion. Not bad considering its humble Pong origins.
All this considered, it’s no surprise that we’ve seen an uptick in Hollywood actors flocking to be a part of a scene with such a lucrative present and future. Mads Mikkelsen, Keanu Reeves, Jon Bernthal and Willem Dafoe to name a few have all starred in games released in the past five years. Their involvement reflects the monumental shift in the perception of video games. Even industry titans like Disney are making significant in-roads into gaming, havingjust invested $1.5 billion into Epic Gamesas part of Bob Iger’s second term challenge to solidify a gaming presence for the company. A rising tide should lift all boats – unless you’re aboard the U.S.S. Microsoft, which seems to have sprung a leak.
The Xbox Series X and S consoles are intended to be an upgrade from the Xbox One in every way. But their advancements have yet to prove truly enticing; the One currently ranks above the Series X/S by almost double the sales. When you couple this fact with comments from analytics company Circana’s games industry expert, Mat Piscatella, who hassuggested that this current console generation is now past its selling peak, it paints a worrying picture for team Xbox. Things appear even worse when you look at console sales figures from 2024. According to Statista, the Xbox Series X/Ssold less than 2.5 million units across the entire year– the PlayStation 5sold the same figure in the first quarter of 2024 alone. There are also the allegations that Xbox is supposedly closing down its department which handles the manufacture and delivery of games to physical retailers, which feels ominously connected to itsevasive responseto areport that it plans to pull out of selling consoles in the EMEA region. If Xbox really has been involved in a ‘console war’, all of this points to the signal to retreat.
But Xbox isn't retreating – it has already surrendered. During the long Activision-Blizzard acquisition process, a statement from Microsoft found in the findings of fact revealed that the company doesn’t believe its Xbox division lost the console war –it thinks it never had a shot to begin with. So, what does a company built around a video game console do when its newest model is struggling to match its predecessor in sales, and its parent company openly remarks on its failure? It gets out of the console business.
It's no secret that Xbox Game Pass has become a key priority for the company.Leaked internal documentsrevealed the estimated prices Xbox expected to be asked to pay to put AAA-titles like Grand Theft Auto 5 ($12-15 million per month) and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor ($300 million) on the subscription service. Xbox taking such costs seriously demonstrates the company consolidating cloud gaming as a key direction for it moving forward. That goal is clear to see in Microsoft’s recent ‘This Is An Xbox’ advertising campaign, which suggests the company is keen to redefine how players think of Xbox – no longer a console, but an always-accessible service with some hardware to complement it instead.
It seems like this rethinking of what an Xbox is means that the brand’s official hardware won’t be limited to being a box under your TV. An Xbox handheld has been rumored to be in development for the past year or so, backed by another leaked document from the Activision-Blizzard dealings which hints at using handheld-friendly hardware for a next-gen'hybrid cloud gaming platform'. But Microsoft’s pivot in strategy has hardly been a secret. From its announcement of plans to createa mobile game storeto compete with Apple and Google, to Xbox chief Phil Spencer’s own admission that mobile gaming’s dominance in the sphere is shaping the company’s own path moving forward, the new M.O. seems simple: Xbox is the video game brand you can play whenever you want, wherever you are.
So why is Microsoft pivoting? Sure, Xbox has struggled over the past couple of generations, but doesn’t the video game console market reign supreme? You’d be surprised. In 2024, of the total 3.3 billion estimated video gamers,over 1.93 billion of them play via a mobile device. That, of course, includes your grandmother playing Candy Crush Saga and your “non-gamer” cousin who still clocks up hours of Clash of Clans. But mobile gaming is now so much more than these casual audiences – over the last decade it has quickly become the dominant pillar of the video game market among every generation, but especially Gen Z and Gen Alpha. In 2024, thetotal market valuation for the video game industrywas $184.3 billion, with mobile games comprising exactly half of that entire figure at $92.5 billion (a 2.8% increase from the previous year). Where do consoles weigh in? At just $50.3 billion, or 27%, and that’s dropped 4% since 2023. No wonder Microsoft wants to turn your phone into an Xbox.
But this isn’t a new development. By 2013, the Asian market for mobile gaming was already dwarfing that of the western world by heights of 759% in South Korea and 280% in China. You might think GTA 5 was the most profitable game of 2013, but you’d be wrong: Both Puzzle & Dragon and Candy Crush Saga outperformed Rockstar’s juggernaut by $1.5 and $1.4 billion respectively. Take a wide-angle lens to the 2010s as a whole for video games, and you’ll find that five of the highest-grossing games were mobile games – Crossfire, Monster Strike, Honor of Kings, Puzzle & Dragon, and Clash of Clans. When you look back on the decade, I highly doubt any of these titles immediately spring to mind – and yet, I’m sure most reading this have the start-up music for Clash of Clans seared into their brains.
Phones are not the only platform drawing attention away from consoles. While not as significant as mobile gaming’s explosion, it’s clear to see that player habits have shifted toward a greater appreciation for PC gaming. Since 2014, there has been a year-on-year growth of 59 million new PC players, taking us from 1.31 billion in 2014 to1.86 billion in 2024. It’s worth noting this rise is complimented by a gargantuan 200 million in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic, during which streaming became a very attractive pastime for many house-bound players. But regardless of if Twitch called to them or not, gamers have become more technologically literate, educated by their peers online on how to build a PC powerhouse, what the best GPUs are, and how to overclock your circuit-ware. As a result, the PC’s global share of the video game market in 2024 lands at $41.5 billion – so it won’t be long until the PC battleline overtakes the army of console players, right? Well, maybe not.Netzoo’s 2016 Global Games Market Value reportdefined a $2.3 billion gap between console and PC – but in 2024, that gap has increased to $9 billion. So despite the rise of more advanced GPUs, circuit-boards, and Gen Z and Alpha’s technological craftiness, it’s a market that’s on thefallrather than the rise – at least for now. If that fall continues, it's not great news for Xbox, which has made Windows PCs its second home.
But it’s not just the dominance of mobile and the uncertain future of PC that Xbox has to contend with. Wars typically have two opposing sides, so it’s about time we looked at where PlayStation fits into this console war. Luckily for Sony, things are going pretty well. In its latest quarterly earnings report, Sony revealed75 million PS5s have been sold to date– that’s a big lead ahead of the combined 29.7 million sales for the Xbox Series X/S. The gap between the two consoles is widening, too; stats suggest that for every one Xbox Series X/S bought during November 2024,five PlayStation 5 consoles were also purchased(a ratio no doubt helped by the launch of the PS5 Pro.) Sony’s Game and Network Services also saw a healthy 12.3% bump in its profits during the final months of 2024, helped specifically by healthy first-party sales including Astro Bot selling 1.5 million copies in under two months, and lifetime sales for Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut surpassing 13 million. The future looks very bright for the PS5. Ampere Analysis’ games research director, Piers Harding-Rolls,estimates that by 2029, Sony will have sold 106.9 million consoles. How do things look for the Xbox Series X/S’s future? Well, leaked Microsoft documents estimate that by 2027,it expects to have sold around 56-59 million units. While it’s not a directly comparable projection, it’s not good. In order for Microsoft to re-establish its competitive edge in the current market, it will need to close the 5:1 PlayStation-to-Xbox gap, significantly increase the number of units sold year-on-year, and also bolster the profitability of its exclusives. Projections don’t support a positive outcome for those first two requirements, and given Phil Spencer’s ‘no red lines’ mantra on Xbox titles coming to PlayStation and Switch (possibly even including the next Halo title), the argument could be made that PlayStation is already the King of Console.
But looking at the PS5 in isolation paints a different picture. 50% of all PlayStation users arecurrently still playing on older PS4sinstead of PS5s, despite the newest generation now entering the second half of its life-cycle. Why is this? Well, of the top 20 best-selling games in the U.S. in 2024, only one is truly PS5-exclusive – Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, at #19. Helldivers 2 does feature at #3 but was also playable on PC at launch. Looking beyond last year, if we disregard remasters of PS4 games, there are roughly 15 genuine PS5-exclusive games on the console as a whole. There’s little here to justify the console’s price in many people’s eyes.
If the PS5 is struggling to justify its regular $500 price tag, then it's understandable why the $700 PS5 Pro debuted to a mixed reception to say the least. The general consensus amongst tech journalists is that perhaps this upgrade came tooearlywithin the cycle, especially given the games advertised in its campaign were slightly upscaled generation-old remasters. WhenIGN polled its readers, the result was overwhelmingly clear – the PS5 Pro has little to offer for forking over that much cash. So, simply put, the PS5 simply isn’t a must-buy console – at least, not yet. This will undoubtedly change when the behemoth that is Grand Theft Auto 6 finally releases later this year, which is almost guaranteed to become the shining star of this generation and the first chance for the PS5 to show off its true power.
So, is the console war over? If you’re Microsoft, it would appear there was never any belief that there was a chance to battle Sony for supremacy. If you’re Sony, your new console has become a success but lacks the true pedigree to be claimed as a new leap forward yet, feeling more like a bunny hop than anything else. The true winner of the console war seems to be those who chose not to play it at all. Rumors of mobile gaming companies encroaching onto the traditional console gaming sphere will only ramp up in the years to come, with Tencent rumored to be in talks to buy out Ubisoft from the Guillemot brothers, having already purchased Sumo Group in 2021. Mobile gaming is becoming increasingly pivotal to the sustainability and profitability of these companies – Take-Two Interactive claim that 10% of the world’s population plays its subsidiary Zynga’s games every month. That means that it’s more than likely that your grandma playing Zynga Poker and Words with Friends 2 is funding the continued development of Grand Theft Auto 6 – not a sentence you would expect to read five years ago, but one reflective of the new state of play of the video game market. The next five years of video gaming history will be defined less and less by who has the most powerful hardware, and more about whose cloud gaming server farm can expand the quickest and strongest. The console war is over, but the mobile gaming war (and the myriad of smaller conflicts that inevitably spin out of it) has only begun.

"Razer's new 2025 lineup of gaming laptops are now up for preorder. TheRazer Blade 16andRazer Blade 18can now be ordered directly from Razer.com and will be equipped with the upcoming Intel and Ryzen processors (depending on which display size you get) as well as the anticipated RTX 5000-series mobile GPUs in three variants: RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080, and RTX 5090. Preordering will also get you some bonus accessories depending on the model.

Razer Blade laptops are well known for their impeccable build quality. The chassis is built from a single piece of aluminum and is designed to be exceptionally thin and light for a gaming laptop. In order to get away with the svelte form factor, Razer employs its own proprietary cooling design which incorporates a vacuum sealed, liquid filled, copper vapor chamber to effectively whisk away the heat. Much like Apple MacBook Pros, a lot of engineering goes into a Razer Blade laptop, which is why they command a premium price compared to other mainstream brands.
The Razer Blade 18 is an Intel-based system and the base config is equipped with the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, which is a more performance-minded chip compared to the current Core Ultra 9 185H, which focuses on efficiency. The rest of the specs include an 18"" Dual UHD+ 240Hz display (which can natively switch to FHD+ 440Hz), RTX 5070 Ti graphics, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $3,499.99. You can upgrade to either the RTX 5080 or the RTX 5090.
Preordering the Razer Blade 16 will also get you an X-Ray Razer laptop skin and a USB-C dock.
The Razer Blade 16 is a Ryzen system and the base config is equipped with an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU. The rest of the specs include a 16"" 240Hz QHD+ OLED display, RTX 5070 Ti graphics, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $2,999.99. The processor can be upgraded to a Ryzen AI 9 370HX, and the GPU can be upgraded to either the RTX 5080 or  RTX 5090.
Preordering the Razer Blade 18 will get youan X-Ray Razer laptop skin and RGB laptop stand.
Razer has listed an expected ship date ofApril 30on the product pages.
Our benchmarks are in, and it looks like the RTX 5090 is indeed the new king of mobile GPUs, although not by the leaps and bounds we were hoping for. On average, the RTX 5090 is about 5%-10% more powerful than the RTX 4090 that it replaces. However, add in DLSS 4 and the gap widens.
RTX 5090 Mobile Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas
""If you already have a decent gaming laptop, you really shouldn’t look at the RTX 5090 twice. It doesn’t deliver much of an improvement over its last-generation counterpart, which remains excellent. However, if you’ve been waiting to upgrade to a high-end gaming laptop for a while, features like multi-frame generation and battery boost will make premium laptops powered by Nvidia’s latest even better.""
Dell announced the return of the venerable Alienware Area-51 gaming laptop back in CES 2025, and starting today it is finally available to order. It comes in two size variants: the16"" model starts at $3,199.99and the18"" model starts at $3,399.99. As expected from Alienware's new flagship laptop, the Area-51 is equipped with current generation components, including the latest and greatest Intel Core Ultra 9 CPU and NVIDIA Blackwell GPU. Orders are expected to ship out starting April 30, so get your reservation in now to prevent any additional delays.

"Star Wars Hunterspublisher Zynga has announced plans for the game to shut down entirely just nine months after it was released, and it appears plans to launch a PC version of Steam are scrapped.

The NaturalMotion-developed, free-to-download team-based battle arena game launched on Nintendo Switch and iOS and Android in June 2024. IGN’sStar Wars: Hunters reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Star Wars: Hunters’ lighthearted PvP fun is like a party at the Death Star: Impressive for a bit, but probably not a place you’ll want to hang around for too long.”
It seems the review was prescient, asZynga announcedthat “after careful consideration” it had decided the final content update for Star Wars: Hunters across all platforms would be released on April 15, with the game remaining playable until October 1, 2025.
“We understand this news may be disappointing and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly,” Zynga continued. “Your passion and dedication to the game and its community have meant the world to us, and we are committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process.”
Here are the logistics: on March 25, Season 5 will be extended by three weeks. Zynga will re-run events and shop bundles from the Season, and the Ranked Season will also be extended, giving players more time to hit Kyber 1 rank.
On April 15, the game’s final content update will be released for free and in-game purchases will be disabled across all platforms. New Support Hunter, Tuya, will join the game as part of the final update. Tuya will be available and playable for all users immediately at no cost, along with a slate of additional in-game content. Zynga will continue to run a final Ranked Mode leaderboard for players to compete in and run all battlefields and game modes in rotation.
And then, on October 1, online servers will officially shut down, and Star Wars: Hunters will no longer be playable beyond this point.
There’s no mention of the PC version,which was announced to launch on Steam in early access form this year, in the shutdown notice. Its Steam page now includes a notice that the game is “no longer available on the Steam store.”
Take-Two-owned Zynga is best known for mobile games FarmVille, Words with Friends, and CSR Racing, but with Star Wars: Hunters it branched out to console for the first time. Similarly, Star Wars: Hunters was meant to be the first Zynga-published game to launch on PC.
“The success of Star Wars: Hunters on mobile and Nintendo Switch devices has led to our decision to expand the game to PC,” said Yaron Leyvan, executive vice president, games, at Zynga, back in November.
“This is something our community of fans have been asking for and we are very excited to welcome even more players to Vespaara. This moment also marks a milestone for Zynga as we bring one of our games to PC for the first time.”
There are still a number of Star Wars video games in the works, including Respawn Entertainment's third Star Wars Jedi game andBit Reactor's turn-based tactics game set to be revealed at Star Wars Celebration 2025.

There really isn't adirectreplacement for PS Plus as it's required for online play on PS5 and PS4, but there are some alternatives with free (or close to free) trials that offer a catalog of games to stream, if you so desire. However, most (if not all) of these alternatives require either a different console, a PC, or a mobile device to use the service.
Other services like Ubisoft+ and EA Play feature publisher-specific catalogs of games to stream, but they don't currently offer any free trials.

"As a part of Microsoft's ongoing efforts toimplement artificial intelligence into basically everything, the company is preparing to introduce its AI Copilot into your Xbox experience to give you gaming advice, help you remember where you left off last time you played, and perform other tasks.

Announced today, Copilot for gaming will be rolled out for Xbox Insiders through the Xbox mobile app sometime soon for testing. If you're not already aware, Copilot is Microsoft's existing AI chatbot (that replaced Cortana in 2023) that's already integrated into Windows. The gaming version will have a handful of features at launch. You can ask it to install games on your Xbox for you (a process you can already do now just by pushing a single button on the app), and you can also ask it about your play history (in case you forgot what you were doing last time you played), achievements, library, or for a recommendation of what to play next. You'll also be able to speak to Copilot for Gaming directly on the Xbox app while you're playing, and it will serve you answers in the same way Copilot currently does when asked questions via Windows.
Probably the biggest use-cases touted by Microsoft available at launch is Copilot as a gaming assistant. You can already ask Copilot questions about games any time on PC, such as how to beat a boss or solve a puzzle, and it will source answers via Bing from various online guides, websites, wikis, and forums. Soon, you'll also be able to ask it those same questions on the Xbox app.
""Our goal is to have Copilot for Gaming source the most accurate game knowledge — so we are working with game studios to make sure the information Copilot surfaces reflects their vision, and Copilot will refer players back to the original source of the information.""
Unshockingly, Microsoft does not intend to limit itself to just these Copilot functions. In a press briefing, Microsoft spokespeople discussed other future possibilities for Copilot in video games, including as awalkthrough assistant to explain basic game functions, remember where items where left in a game, or tell you where to find new ones, or as a helper in competitive games that could offer strategy suggestions and tips in real-time to counter opponents' moves, or explain how and why an engagement unfolded the way it did. Though it was emphasized that these were both just ideas they were toying with, the presentation made clear that Microsoft is insistant on finding ways to integrate Copilot closely with regular Xbox gameplay. And Microsoft confirmed to me that it will eventually work with not just first-party studios, but third-party studios for integration into their games as well.
With that in mind, I asked Microsoft if Copilot gaming would be opt in or opt out of use, or if users could opt out of having their data used to train it. The answer is that yes, Xbox Insiders can opt out during the preview, but the door was left open for Copilot to be mandatory in the future. Here's what a spokesperson said:
""During this preview on mobile, players will be able to decide how and when they want to interact with Copilot for Gaming, whether it has access to their conversation history, and what it does on their behalf.
""As we preview and test Copilot for Gaming with players early, we will continue to be transparent about what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices players have around sharing their personal data.""
IGN understands that Copilot is not being limited to just player-focused usage, and that Microsoft will be providing an overview on plans for developer use in asession at the Game Developers Conference on Monday next week.

"With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its wayandits audience.

Capcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.
But in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.
2016 was a bad year for Capcom.
The big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.
This was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.
All of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .
Achieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.
Capcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4.
2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema.
Unfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.
“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.
This directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op.
This downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.
But it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.
This slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.
It was clear something needed to change.
By the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability.
While neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.
“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”
Those constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6.
""We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V,"" Nakayama says. ""And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title.""
All this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards.“There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.
“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”
The team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.
There was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master.
“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.”
Street Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series.
While they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.
While Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.
Around the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience.
“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”
If you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.
“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”
Itsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance.
No other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened.
Firstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.
“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”
Monster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.
This created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.
But the reality was that Monster Hunterdidhave fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.
Released in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.
“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”
It was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”
It wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world.
“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”Tsujimoto says.
One important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.
This explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.
“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”
Monster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call.
“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&D teams were divided into R&D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”
Takeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.
There were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.
“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.
The game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series.
But Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time.
“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.
The result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history.
Naturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?
Ampo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”
But despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.
Around the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.
“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.”
Itsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.
The 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. ""Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively,"" Itsuno says. ""When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”
This vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should.
Ampo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, ""So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.”
This meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.
“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”
Since 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.
Focusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat.
But what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.
Many of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever.
When asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”
Monster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”

Although it boasts many of the same characters as its mobile MOBA predecessor, Honor of Kings: World is no MOBA. Instead, it’s a class-driven action game – for PC as well as mobile, by the way – with the kind of over-the-shoulder, action-driven combat you might expect from something like Genshin Impact. But rather than locking mechanics or gameplay behind randomized drops like in MiHoYo’s game, Honor of Kings offers players different classes to choose from. And while the same overall control scheme unifies each class – a dodge, three standard abilities, and an ultimate of sorts – the roster of different classes struck me as fairly diverse, each with its own abilities and special perks.
Usually, you’ll be able to play with two separate classes, though sometimes you might need to stick with just one for story purposes. It seems like TiMi’s put a lot of effort into the dual-class system, allowing you to switch between the two during combat. The most interesting example they showed during my demo was starting a long, multiple-attack combo and switching characters once the target was launched into the air to extend a combo. It kind of reminded me of a tag system in a fighting game.
With 11 different classes in the demo I played, I’m certain there are tons of different combinations and ways to style on your opponent. But since this was my first time playing, I looked for balance above all else: I stuck with an even-keeled loadout, using a sword-wielding class for my primary role and a ranged gunner for the second. The two nicely filled in gaps left by the other during my attempt at a boss fight: I’d lay down fire using the gunner’s active reload mechanic to improve my damage and rate of fire when the boss was spitting out attacks in a frenzy, making sure to dodge the occasional flaming projectile and then rush him down with my sword, laying on the damage with a vengeance.
This swapping was easily my favorite part of the demo. I enjoyed hammering away at the boss’s stance meter, breaking his stance, and shooting the gunner’s R ability as I closed the distance, swapping to my sword class, and unleashing a devastating ultimate attack of sorts to juice every second from the boss’ temporarily weakened state.
Taking the boss down to a certain point also revealed an interesting story beat that eventually led to me playing as a completely separate character from the pre-built avatar provided for the demo. TiMi didn’t offer much information on how frequently to expect this kind of change, only that it would happen from time to time. The demo took place somewhere closer to halfway through Honor of Kings: World’s runtime, opening up my two classes’ skill trees just enough for me to have some fun with them without overcomplicating its combat.
The boss itself was a giant monkey character with various different masks, with a personality and attacking style for each. According to the developer leading my demo, this mechanic has its roots in a traditional style of Chinese theater calledBian lian. One mask might see him spitting fire in a massive area of effect on the map, while another might see him throw around a few melee attacks. I loved this melding of culture, history, and story with a gameplay mechanic.
Aside from briefly seeing another journalist in my demo in a hub area before the tutorial, I didn’t have a chance to check out any of World’s multiplayer offerings. TiMi showed a few clips of four-person squads crawling dungeons and taking on bosses before our demo, but teased something that sounded more like an MMO. That part is still a work in progress, so they didn’t share much beyond acknowledging that there would be a bigger scale multiplayer mode in the full game, so I’m curious to see what that looks like given my demo’s single-player scope.
Before the demo, one of TiMi’s developers walked me through some of World’s premise and setup, saying that Honor of Kings: World was a gift of sorts to the MOBA’s loyal fanbase that’s propelled it to massive success in the ten years since its launch. True as that may be, I left the demo concerned about monetization.
When another journalist asked about how TiMi plans to make money with Honor of Kings: World, the developer leading our session gave a concerning answer. “The game’s gonna be based around social, so outfits and stuff,” they said.
On its own, funding a free-to-play game with cosmetics isn’t necessarily a problem – especially since the developers made it clear that there wouldn’t be any pay-to-win – but given Honor of Kings: World’s scale, with flashy cutscenes, tons of playable characters, and epic boss fights, I can’t help but feel concerned about whether or not World’s model is financially sustainable, regardless of whether or not it’s based on one of the most successful games of the century.
Honor of Kings: World undoubtedly has a bright future ahead of it, provided TiMi can stick to its promise of giving fans of its MOBA hit a celebration worthy of its success. Even though I’m still a little worried about the amount of microtransactions that Honor of Kings: World could potentially need to fund its high production value, I still had a ton of fun dodging the big primate’s swings."

"UPDATE:There is added confusion over Silent Hill f's classification in Australia. The rating reported below has been removed, and the Australian Classification Board has confirmed it has not actually been rated at this point.

ORIGINAL STORY:Konami’s upcoming Silent Hill f has been refused classification in Australia, meaning the game would not be able to be sold within Australia at this time. However, Silent Hill f’s RC rating has been assigned by an automated rating tool and not via actual Australian Classification Board members so, based on precedent, it’s unlikely this is the end of the story.
Konami does not distribute its own games locally in Australia, but IGN has contacted its third-party distribution partner for comment.
The specific reason for Silent Hill f’s RC rating has not been supplied at this time. Since the introduction of an adults-only category for games in Australia (R18+) in January 2013, games that have been refused classification in Australia are only typically flagged for sexual activity with a person who appears to be a child under 18, visual depictions of sexual violence, or tying incentives and rewards to drug use. 2008’s Silent Hill: Homecoming was initially refused classification in Australia in the lead up to its release due to a high impact torture scene but that was several years prior to the introduction of the R18+ rating, which now accommodates high impact levels of violence. Silent Hill: Homecoming was later released in Australia with altered camera angles for the problem scene, rated MA15+.
What we already know, however, is that Silent Hill f’s RC rating in Australia has actually been assigned by an online tool maintained by the International Age Rating Coalition – which is a classification system designed for mobile and digitally delivered games. The IARC classification tool is an online questionnaire where applicants simply answer a series of questions about a game’s content. The IARC tool will subsequently assign an automated rating from each territory based on the classification standards from each participating country. In Australia's case, the IARC tool then sends the decision to be published automatically onAustralia’s National Classification Database.
In Australia, the tool can only be used for digitally-distributed games (it wasadopted in 2014due to the fact that, while the Australian Classification Board was rating an average of 755 games per year, over 40,000 games were being released annually on the iOS app store alone at that time). There have beena number of instances where automated IARC ratings have demonstrated a tendency to trend higher than human ratingsfrom the Classification Board. For example, in 2019 Kingdom Come: Deliverance and We Happy Few were widely reported to have suddenly been banned in Australia when they had not.
The IARC tool is free to use, which particularly benefits small publishers and developers. Importantly, all physical releases are still required to be rated by the Classification Board itself so, if Silent Hill f is planning to have a physical release in Australia, a submission to the Classification Board was always going to be mandatory, anyhow. The Classification Board itself can override any classification given by the IARC tool if it disagrees with it.
In Australia, game publishers can either have staff members who are accredited classifiers or authorised assessors. Accredited classifiers are in-house staff who complete training from the Classification Board and can classify games themselves, and their decision will take effect as an official Classification Board decision. Authorised assessors are staff or contractors who have similar training, but their classification decision is limited to a recommendation made to the Australian Classification Board, which must then decide whether to apply it or not.
For now, it’s too early to say whether Silent Hill f’s RC rating in Australia will be upheld after further actions or not. It is, however, the first Silent Hill game to getan 18+ rating certification in Japan.

"Blizzard is reportedly receiving a number of pitches for new StarCraft video games from Korean studios.

In an article brought to the internet’s attention by X / Twitter account@KoreaXboxnews,Asia Todaylisted four Korean companies who are reportedly competing with each other to develop new games based on the StarCraft IP and secure publishing rights: NCSoft, Nexon, Netmarble, and Krafton. Apparently some of these companies have traveled to Blizzard’s headquarters in Irvine, California, to make their pitches.
NCSoft, which is behind the Lineage and Guild Wars MMOs, is said to have pitched a StarCraft RPG of some kind (an MMORPG?). Nexon, maker of The First Descendant, has pitched a “unique” use of the StarCraft IP. Netmarble (Solo Leveling: Arise, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad) is hoping to make a StarCraft mobile game. And Krafton, the company behind battle royale PUBG and The Sims competitor inZOI, wants to make a StarCraft game “based on its own development capabilities.”
Of course, video game companies pitch other video game companies all the time when it comes to securing publishing rights and development contracts. And it may be the case that nothing mentioned here goes anywhere. But StarCraft fans will certainly take note of Blizzard’s reported interest in doing… something to expand the much-loved sci-fi universe, given how long it’s been since the last game in the franchise came out. Activision Blizzard declined to comment when contacted by IGN.
It’s worth remembering that in September, it emerged thatBlizzard was making a third attempt at developing a StarCraft shooter, with former Far Cry executive producer Dan Hay, who joined Blizzard in 2022, leading the charge.
The news came from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier while speaking to IGN’s Podcast Unlocked, below, about his recent book, Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment. Hay’s StarCraft shooter is mentioned in the book, and IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey asked Schreier if it’s likely to actually come out.
“If it’s not canceled!” Schreier replied. “This is Blizzard after all. Their history with StarCraft shooters is not good.
“Yes, that is a project that as far as I know is in development, or at least as of the time that I wrote this book was in development. They are working on a StarCraft shooter, StarCraft is not dead at Blizzard.
“The goal of the book isn’t to get a bunch of scoops about upcoming things. That wasn’t the purpose of this book at all, it was very much to tell a story and focus on stuff that had happened. But this felt like such an interesting and useful nugget to include because it really just shows you that Blizzard cannot quit StarCraft shooters.”
That was a reference to Blizzard’s infamous attempt to release a StarCraft shooter in the past as part of a bid to expand the StarCraft franchise beyond its real-time strategy origins.StarCraft Ghost, announced in 2002, was going to be a tactical-action console game in which you played as a deadly Ghost operative in the employ of the Dominion, but it was canceled in 2006 after a series of delays.
A second attempt to make a StarCraft shooter, codenamed Ares, was canceled in 2019 so Blizzard could focus onDiablo 4andOverwatch 2. Ares was reportedly “like Battlefield in the StarCraft universe,” but, like Ghost, fell by the wayside.
More recently, in November,Blizzard was spotted hiring for an “upcoming open-world shooter game,”with all signs pointing to it being a StarCraft FPS.
Things are slowly ramping up for StarCraft. Blizzard recently releasedStarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection on Game Pass, and announced a StarCraft crossover with Warcraft card game Hearthstone.

"825 Forest Road is now streaming on Shudder.

Writer and director Stephen Cognetti is ready to be known as more than the “Hell House LLC Guy.” Unfortunately, his latest movie won’t help him accomplish that goal. 825 Forest Road ditches the found-footage Halloween scares of Cognetti’s directorial debut and its sequels for a more traditional approach to horror. Unfortunately, it's nowhere near as engaging or inventive as those four (and counting) trips to the cursed Abaddon Hotel. 825 Forest Road is a tangle of feeble lore, jumbled storytelling jumps, and an upsetting mannequin who’s scary, but can’t quite escape the shadow of the terrifyingly mobile clown dummies that stalk the Hell House movies.
The ingredients of his past success are all in place: 825 Forest Road brings a malevolent force and unsuspecting victims to the central location of the title. Chuck Wilson (Joe Falcone), his seamstress wife Maria (Elizabeth Vermilyea), and his artistic younger sister Isabelle (Kathryn Miller) leave tragedy behind to make a fresh start in the small town of Ashland Falls. But Ashland's darkest supernatural secret eventrually comes a-knocking at Chuck's front door: Her name is Helen Foster (Diomira Keane), and untimely deaths are her calling card. Cue the stock possession-horror thrills as the trio’s spacious yet surprisingly affordable home is infested by a vengeful spirit that Helen eventually channels into Maria's disturbing antique mannequin, ""Martha.""
There’s no visual imagination to be found in 825 Forest Road. Ashland Falls is portrayed like any other humble American community, no different from the settings of the 50 other scrappy little haunted-house movies you’ll see this year. The character Cognetti brought to Hell House LLC's monstrous attraction doesn’t extend to 825 Forest Road, either – with its architectural stuffiness and generic production design, the house might as well be an unoccupied model in the middle of a new housing development. And without the found-footage hook, the filmmaking lacks pop, sucking the life out of Chuck's residential nightmare.
Cognetti also miscalculates the durability of his storytelling, splitting 825 Forest Road into three repetitive chapters focused on a different member of the family. We follow Chuck, Irene, and Maria as they interact with Helen throughout the same sorta-spooky events, but the momentum is choppy at best – nothing revealed along the way is thunderous enough to be rewound multiple times. Cognetti struggles to bring his concept to life, whether it's Helen's underbaked backstory or the counterintuitive motivations that peg Chuck's crew as mindless cannon fodder. A few valiant efforts are made to prop up the exposition – like introducing the town's underground paranormal discussion group – but if the devil's in the details, he's on vacation.
I'll admit: Martha the mannequin – with her crackly,  papier-mâché complexion and habit of turning up where you least expect her – makes an effective antagonist. As Helen taunts the befuddled residents of 825 Forest Road by puppeting Martha around the house, Cognetti calls back to his nerve-shredding usage of Hell House LLC's bald-and-painted clown prop. The ghastly figure makes a good jump scare (when she’s not a shoddy digital effect), but 825 Forest Road is never scarier than when Martha gains mobility, scampering about like one of Donna Beneviento'sResident Evil Villageminions. So much of 825 Forest Road is a struggle, but not when Cognetti reminds us why Hell House LLC garnered a ravenous following addicted to blood-pumping terrors. If only the Martha material had a more powerful, lingering effect.
The rest of 825 Forest Road stumbles through the motions. The performances are a serviceable crop, but the cast doesn’t give you anything that'll stay seared in your memory. Cognetti recycles a few tricks from his Hell House LLC experiences, but they're less impactful without the intimacy found-footage can provide. Then there's the death blow of the final act, an anticlimax that fades to black at the worst possible moment. The kernel of an idea in 825 Forest Road never puffs into something tastier – it’s the hardened shell at the bottom of Cognetti’s bowl of savory found-footage frights. Perhaps the upcoming Hell House LLC: Lineage will prove a better method of closing the door on this chapter of his career.
825 Forest Road is an unimposing ghost story that resembles a first draft begging for revisions. Hell House LLC director Stephen Cognetti is able to string a few solid scares together here, but overall, his first feature-length excursion beyond the grounds of the Abaddon Hotel is a forgettable bore. There's nothing vital or remarkable about this run-of-the-mill haunted-house movie – its spirit-conjuring villain, Helen Foster, deserves better, frankly. You'll get your kicks from a manic mannequin come to life, but those moments have all the fleeting adrenaline rush of a pinprick."
"A Minecraft Movie immediately creates a sticky paradox for itself. Clearly hoping to follow in the footsteps of a project likeThe Lego Movie, this video-game adaptation wants to pay tribute to the open-world flexibility and creativity ofMinecraftwhile staying well within the framework of the game itself, which means including all of the expected blocky visual touchstones and including an obligatory number of cutesy gamer in-jokes. The surprise of the movie is how long it’s able to delay the latter material – long enough, it turns out, forNapoleon Dynamitedirector Jared Hess to get his foot in the door, expertly adapting his deadpan comic-strip style for a children’s fantasy.

Hess’ foray into big-time franchise filmmaking reunites him with Jack Black, the star of his 2006 slapstick adventure,Nacho Libre– and no one can accuse Black of half-assing his way through a paycheck job here. As Steve, a man who “yearned for the mines” as a child and discovers a portal into the magical Overworld as an adult, he throws off the shackles of workaday existence with such relish that his torrent of movie-opening narration feels enthusiastic, rather than blandly explanatory. The short of it: Bad-guy pigs covet the “orb” (like everything else in the Overworld, it’s block-shaped, not an actual orb) that Steve has discovered, so he sends his faithfulwolf-dog, Dennis, to hide it in the real world.
Hess really connects with his Dynamite roots – throwback fashions, drier-than-dry non sequitur – and setting in that real world, where he pauses Steve’s story to follow siblings Natalie (Emma Myers, fromWednesday) and Henry (Sebastian Hansen) as they relocate to a small town in Idaho. There, creative, school-age misfit Henry clicks with Garrett Garrison (Jason Momoa), a former gaming champion who now runs a retro pop-culture junk store on the verge of foreclosure. Natalie, meanwhile, meets Dawn (Danielle Brooks), a friendly real estate agent who moonlights as a kind of mobile zookeeper.
In a movie for grown-ups, this litany of quirk might seem a bit much: Natalie is a young woman of indeterminate age who gets a job running social media for a local potato-chip factory; Henry tinkers with his design for a working jetpack. For a kid picture, though, it’s sweetly silly, even distinctive; the kitschy tater-tots-and-alpacas ambience is pure Hess. Momoa in particular makes a surprisingly good fit for the filmmaker’s sensibility, playing a less bullying version of the blustery Napoleon Dynamite sensei Rex Kwon Do. In fact, the first 30 to 40 minutes of A Minecraft Movie have enough big laughs that it’s almost a disappointment when Henry, Garrett, Natalie, and Dawn stumble upon the orb and wind up accidentally sucked into the Overworld.
Eventually they meet up with Steve, who provides some standard gameplay tutelage in advance of their quest. The quest itself is conceptually muddy, confusingly and erratically presented as some combination of saving Steve’s beloved Dennis, protecting the orb, and eventually bringing the four displaced travelers home. The seams of the six-writer screenplay show frequently, like when characters make plans and then deviate from them without comment as if the actors are all working from different versions of the script. Based on the uninspired action sequences – digital hordes running and flying around in a manner better suited for an in-gameLord of the Ringsfan film – there aren't many big-budget fantasy epics in Hess' future. But A Minecraft Movie stays light on its feet nonetheless by continually pausing for slapstick silliness and cartoonish little sketches like an ongoing and delightfully pointless subplot involving Jennifer Coolidge and a resident of the Overworld.
Eventually, the more antic side of things takes over, and the various CG landscapes populated by blocky people and creatures start to feel repetitive. It’s like a slightly more polished version of someone’s playthrough video, only with a couple of big stars getting thrown around the screen. What A Minecraft Movie misses from Minecraft the game is its combination of minutiae and vastness; as much as the movie advertises its subject’s creative flexibility, it shortchanges any potential obsessiveness in favor of making the Overworld look a little more like something out of aMariogame. The parallelsto Black’s other video-game-movie gig– and aspirations to its popularity with the playground set – become especially clear when Steve chases the next “Peaches” by riffing out no fewer than three little songs. (On the other hand, it’s hard to resist Black bringing his goofball-rock-star shtick to Gen Alpha.) As with so many game-based movies, the mismatch between what each medium does best isn’t really reconciled by A Minecraft Movie. But turning the world’s best-selling video game into Jared Hess’s best feature in years is, admittedly, a pretty creative undertaking.
For a big-studio adaptation of a massively popular video-game, A Minecraft Movie lets a surprising amount of its director’s personality shine through.

"Microsoft has unveiled a list of Xbox Game Pass titles set to join the service in the first half of April 2025, revealing a strong lineup of first- and third-party games, including South of Midnight, Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition, Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls – Ultimate Evil Edition, and more.

It’s a remarkably strong month that was detailed in a recentXbox Wirepost. Expect major hitters to start dropping in tomorrow, April 3, kicking off the month with Gearbox Software’s Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition (Cloud, Console, and PC) for all tiers, while All You Need Is Help (Console), Still Wakes the Deep (Xbox Series X | S), and Wargroove 2 (Console) all join Game Pass Standard. There’s more than enough in this first block to keep even the most dedicated Xbox fan busy all month, but you’ll only have five days before South of Midnight (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) and Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls – Ultimate Evil Edition (Console and PC) arrive for all Game Pass subscribers April 8.
South of Midnight, Compulsion Games’ Deep South-set folklore adventure, is poised to be one of Xbox’s biggest releases of the year, and its presence on Game Pass will no doubt have hordes of players seeing what it has to offer. Microsoft’s official description sheds more light on how it will bring some life to Game Pass this month: “Explore the mythos and confront mysterious creatures of the Deep South in this modern folktale while learning to weave an ancient power to surmount obstacles and face the pain haunting your hometown.”
April 9 follows with Commandos: Origins (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, with Blue Prince (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) coming to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass tiers April 10. Finally, Hunt: Showdown 1896 (PC) will round out the Wave 1 drops come April 15 when it is added for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers.
Xbox Game Pass perks are also getting a refresh for the first half of April 2025. Highlights include the Beyond the Void Bundle for The First Descendant, the Sweet Starter Pack for Candy Crush Solitaire players on mobile devices, and an anniversary Seventh Serving Emote for Sea of Thieves fans. You can see the full list of everything coming to Game Pass in the first half of April below.
Another month of Game Pass newcomers means another batch of games will soon be leaving, too. You’ll be losing access to these titles come April 15, so if you’re interested in playing but don’t think you’ll have time to reach the credits, Microsoft still offers a 20% discount for members looking to pick up a last-minute purchase.

The PS Portal, Sony's handheld gaming accessory for the PS5 console, looks very much like an extended split-pad DualSense controller with an 8-inch 1080p LCD screen in the middle of it. It turns your PS5 into a gaming handheld by letting you stream games from your console at up to 60fps. The controller mirrors the same features found on the DualSense, including haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and a touchscreen interface that replaces the Dualsense's touchpad. The Portal can stream your games even when you're outside of your home, with the caveat that you have access tovery stable, very fastinternet connection. Keep in mind that the PS Portal is not a standalone device. This is strictly a remote player for the PlayStation 5, so you will need a PS5 to use it.
Update:You no longer need a PS5 to play games on the PS Portal. Now, rather than being limited to simply streaming games from a $500 console to a $200 handheld, Sony has introduced a feature that lets owners stream games directly from its PlayStation Now cloud streaming service. No PS5 required. Portal owners now have the option to either connect the Portal to their PS5 as before, or directly to Sony’s cloud servers. Choose the latter and suddenly you have access to a library of more than 120 games, including Ghost of Tsushima, Resident Evil 3 Remake, The Last of Us Part 1 Remastered, and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.It’s worth noting you must be a subscriber to the highest tier of PlayStation Plus, but $18 a month is much more attractive that splashing out $500 upfront plus an extra $70 a game.
It should be said that the PlayStation Portal isn’t the only way to stream your PS5 games over Wi-Fi within your home. You can mimic its functionality by downloading the PS Remote Play app on a mobile device, including other gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck.  That said, it's more complicated to set up and you'll lose out on some of the Dualsense's features.
PlayStation Portal Reviewby Seth Macy
""The PlayStation Portal is the most surprising device I've ever come away from loving after going in loaded with skepticism. It's such a better experience than using your phone with a slap-on controller, and it works so much better than I was anticipating. I really love the freedom it gives me to play my PS5 from anywhere with decent WiFi coverage, especially when the rest of my family was using the TV to (somewhat ironically) play the Switch. Bearing in mind that it’s in no way a stand-alone device and 100% requires a PlayStation 5 to function at all, the biggest things keeping the Portal from being a truly amazing device are its current lack of a way to access WiFi that requires a web browser to log in, and its lack of Bluetooth support for audio. For now, it's a great device that represents the best current solution for PlayStation Remote Play, and if it weren't for those two baffling caveats, I'd call this a must-own device for every PS5 owner who enjoys playing games on handheld – or has to compete for the household TV.""

"Madame Web star Sydney Sweeney is reportedly in final talks to star in the live-action Gundam movie.

In February, it was confirmed thatthe live action film adaptation of the beloved anime and toy franchise Mobile Suit Gundam had entered production, with Bandai Namco and Legendary signing an agreement to co-finance it.
The companies confirmed Mobile Suit Gundam, which currently lacks an official name, will be written and directed by Sweet Tooth showrunner Kim Mickle and released in theaters globally. No release window or plot details were shared, though a teaser poster, below, was released.
Varietyreported on Sweeney’s Gundam involvement in the live-action Gundam movie, although plot and character details are unknown at this time.
Sweeney is known for HBO drama series Euphoria, The White Lotus, Reality, Anyone but You, and the aforementioned superhero flop Madame Web. Last month,Sweeney was attached to appear in and produce a movie version of a horror story posted on a Reddit thread.
""We plan to steadily announce details as they become finalized,"" Legendary and Bandai Namco said at the time the live-action film was released.
""Mobile Suit Gundam, which began broadcasting in 1979, established the genre of 'real robot anime' that could not be described in terms of simple good and evil, which had been the trend of robot anime up to that point, with realistic depictions of war, detailed scientific examinations, and intricately interwoven human dramas that treated robots as 'weapons' called 'mobile suits,' and caused a huge boom,"" they added.

Astro Bot Reviewby Simon Cardy
""Astro Bot made me smile from beginning to end. A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive. And while you don’t need a long history with Sony systems to enjoy it, it is especially a delight for those with a piece of PlayStation in their heart as a treasure trove full of playable nostalgia awaits. Taking the PS5 marketing mantra that “play has no limits” more seriously than you’d expect, Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it.""

"Niantic Inc. has confirmed the sale of Pokémon Go, Pikmin Bloom, Monster Hunter Now, and their development teams to the Saudi-owned maker of Monopoly Go! for $3.5 billion.

An additional $350 million of cash from Niantic is being distributed as part of the deal, yielding a total value of approximately $3.85 billion for Niantic equity holders.
Ina note to press, Scopely, which is owned by Saudi investment company Savvy Games, said the Niantic games business has over 30 million monthly active players (MAUs), over 20 million weekly active players, and saw more than $1 billion in revenue in 2024. Pokémon Go is the jewel in the crown, ranking as a top 10 mobile game every year since its launch nearly a decade ago, with over 100 million unique players in 2024.
Niantic said its game team has “exciting long-term roadmaps that they will continue to build upon as part of Scopely.”
“This partnership ensures that our games have the long term support needed to be ‘forever games’ that will endure for future generations,” Niantic said in a blog post.
“Players can expect that the games, apps, services, and events they know and love will continue to receive Scopely’s ongoing investment, driven by the same teams that have always created these experiences.”
Ina separate blog post, Pokémon Go chief Ed Wu moved to reassure playerswho had already expressed concern about the fate of the gameif a sale were to go through.
“As it’s always important to me, and our entire game team, that our community understands and is excited by the long-term vision for this game, I want to share why I believe a partnership with Scopely will be a positive step for all of you and the game’s future,” Wu, who was the original engineer on the Pokémon Go codebase and was there for its massive 2016 launch, said.
“Scopely expressed a deep admiration for this community and our team. I have every belief Pokémon Go will further flourish as part of Scopely, not only into its second decade, but for many more years to come, under the mission of discovering Pokémon in the real world and inspiring people to explore together,” Wu continued.
“Our new partnership, along with our decade long partnership with The Pokémon Company, means we can maintain this long-term focus. Scopely fully believes in our mission and ongoing goal to create the best Pokémon Go experience possible. Their focus will be to support our team, providing resources to continue delivering the gameplay you all know and love.
“The entire Pokémon Go team is staying together through this partnership. The same people who have been guiding and building the game for years will continue doing what we love. We’re always continually adding to the game - Raid Battles, friends, Go Battle League, Routes, Dynamax/Gigantamax, and, of course, Pokémon Go Fest and our live events - which I look forward to continuing to do for many years to come. Scopely empowers their game teams as autonomous groups to go after the roadmaps that they’re inspired to pursue, and what each team believes is best for the player experience. This approach is extremely appealing to us at Niantic games. I have spoken to a number of game leaders at Scopely who have given me great confidence in how the company enables each game to independently develop and creatively thrive.
“We will be joining a broader organization dedicated to games. I believe that Pokémon Go can continue to thrive with Scopely’s exclusive and long-term focus on game-making. Scopely’s status as a private company also means we can prioritize what’s best for you, our Trainers, for the long term. We believe that prioritizing short-term gains at the expense of our long-term mission would be counterproductive and self-defeating. Every interaction I’ve had with Scopely leaders has reinforced that we are in total agreement that the scale, longevity and most of all, real world community, of Pokémon Go make it truly special. We are united in protecting that.
“With Scopely’s full commitment, experience and resources, we’re going to make Pokémon Go the very best it can be – with incredible battles for thousands of Trainers at a time at our live events and new ways to connect to your friends and community, all while remaining focused on the excitement and experience of discovering Pokémon in the real world. We have invested to empower thousands of Community Leaders and Ambassadors who lead millions of Trainers to play together in the real world, and Scopely is in full agreement that this highly-admired program will be a priority to invest in together. The real-world community that loves Pokémon Go will remain our guiding light in all we do.
“Our partners at The Pokémon Company have always been central to how we build this game together, starting with the physics of the first Poké Ball throw that we hand-tuned together. I am incredibly grateful for their daily wisdom, guidance, and careful stewardship of our shared vision for discovering Pokémon in the real world, and I’m very excited that our partnership with The Pokémon Company will continue as it has for the last decade.
“I won’t say that Pokémon Go will remain the same, because it has always been a work in progress. But how we create and evolve it will remain unchanged, and I hope that we can make the experience even better for all of you.
“I have so much gratitude for the incredible joy of serving hundreds of millions of Trainers in our real-world community for the past nine years, and I truly believe the best is yet to come.”
Elsewhere, Niantic said it’s spinning offits controversial geospatial AI businessinto a new company, Niantic Spatial Inc., “enabling it to accelerate and scale even more rapidly.” Scopely is a $50 million investor in this new venture, which also has $200 million from Niantic itself.
Niantic Spatial will continue to own and operate its other real-world AR games, Ingress Prime and Peridot.

"With the Nintendo Switch 2 on the horizon and presumably launching sometime in the Summer,  perhaps it’s a little too late for even one ofthe best Switch controllersandJoy-Con alternativesto hit the market. But I suppose it’s better late than never. The NYXI Hyperion 2 is a vast improvement over the original Switch's stock Joy-Con with smooth Hall Effect analog sticks, clicky buttons, and ergonomic grips. And since the Hyperion 2 can be used while detached from the Switch, it’s even good enough to recommend in place of a Pro controller (although it does not come with a snap-grip). So, if you’re looking to stay with the original Switch for the foreseeable future and are still looking for a Joy-Con upgrade to improve the handheld experience, this is what you want.

Coming for the first Hyperion, the Hyperion 2 sports a much more sensible design – while it’s a bit wider than the normal Joy-Con, it doesn’t have a weird grip style that juts out horizontally. The Hyperion 2 retains a symmetrical shape and looks like it belongs on a Switch. A major perk is the ergonomic grip that fills my hands akin to a Steam Deck, riding the line between being substantial and not being too bulky. There’s a textured surface on each handle that also helps your grip stay secure. This feels like a proper controller to hold and remains relatively lightweight at just 80g each (normal Joy-Cons weigh in around 50g each).
The buttons might take a moment to get used to since they work quite differently from the standard Joy-Con. Both the directional pad and face buttons have a clicky mouse-like actuation. What you get in return is a softer and more responsive button-press that’s lighter on the thumbs – they’re also bigger to make them even easier to use. My only gripe is that they have a little too much wiggle room since they’re not tightly locked in place and don’t feel as stable as they should be.
That mouse-click design extends to the shoulder bumpers (L and R) and triggers (ZL and ZR). Since the Switch doesn’t have analog triggers, the Hyperion 2 is able to have hair triggers without losing functionality. They sport a very short travel distance and are quick to hit while being light to the touch. The bumpers are easy to hit as well and all it takes is a tap to actuation, and it’s responsive enough to press on the side of the bumper as well.
The biggest improvement, however, is in the analog sticks. Not only does the magnetic Hall Effect design solve the issue of stick drift (which has plagued many Switch owners), these are full-fledged analog sticks that rival that of other consoles. You get a full range of motion and a consistent resistance throughout that range – while it’s just a tad stiff to get off the deadzone, they remain smooth to the touch for precise movements.
Most aftermarket controllers nowadays have back buttons, including the Hyperion 2 – you get two programmable buttons (one on each grip) that sits along your middle finger. NYXI struck a good balance between being easy enough to press without too much effort and not being so light that you'd accidentally hit them (unless you’re gripping your Switch like your life depends on it.) However, a knock against them here is that you need to download a mobile app called KeyLinker to program opposite-side inputs to a back button. It’s a woefully unintuitive app that also requires you to unlink the controls from the Switch in order to connect to the app. Every aftermarket controller I’ve used in the past has the ability to program its extra buttons on the fly, and perhaps this particular aspect is a limitation of the Joy-Con design being split, but it’s baffling that NYXI doesn’t make this easier.
The RGB lighting along the ends of the face buttons and d-pad, and around each analog stick, is a nice aesthetic touch. A tiny lighting button on the back of the grips lets you cycle through four different settings: off, rainbow effect, solid color, and breathing solid color. For both solid color settings, you can choose seven different colors by holding the lighting button and using the analog stick to cycle through them. Both grips can have their RGB set independently so you can have your own color combo.
You still get rumble functionality (although not HD rumble) and gyroscope motion controls when using the Hyperion 2 wirelessly. The last standout feature, however, is the Turbo setting. There are rare cases in which it’ll be beneficial, but thankfully it’s very easy to set for the moments it’s useful. Simply hold the Turbo button, press the button you want to set, and let go – doing this once will set the button to repeat while holding it, doing it a second time will make the button repeat without touching it, and a third time will reset the button to normal.
When it comes to evaluating gaming performance, I put about five hours into using the NYXI Hyperion 2. The first game I played was Metroid Prime Remastered, and with it being a first-person adventure/shooter, the Hyperion 2 really shined. Looking around and aiming at targets to lock on was so much easier thanks to the smooth analog sticks, so while you don’t necessarily need super-precise aiming in this game, the more robust sticks made it more enjoyable. Jumping is already set to one of the bumpers, but that also freed up both back buttons to be used for inputs like weapon switching or going into Morph Ball mode, which was convenient for me. Here, the Turbo function came in clutch – I set it to ZR so I could rapid-fire by holding ZR instead of having it do a charge shot, and I set the MR back button to shoot normally so I could still do charged shots when I needed.
Doing some cleanup in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was a ton of fun since I love exploring Hyrule for unfinished business, but again, it’s a great game for showcasing the Hyperion 2’s capabilities. I still prefer gyro aiming for making those minute adjustments, but the sticks are so precise that sometimes you don’t need motion controls, especially since the sticks recognize small movements off the deadzone. And having a back button for the sprint action is a godsend for me as well since I can keep controlling the camera at the same time.
I tend to avoid first-person shooters on Switch primarily for performance reasons, but also because playing handheld with the standard Joy-Con is straight-up bad. Like other great Joy-Con alternatives, the Hyperion 2 remedies the problem with its fantastic analog sticks that are on par with that of the Xbox Series X|S gamepad to make aiming much better – I’d even go as far to say that the nimble micro-switch triggers make firing and aiming-down-sights quicker and lighting on my fingers.
NYXI rates the Hyperion 2 to have a 10-meter wireless connection distance, which is a little over 30 feet, and that’s accurate. I never had any issues with connectivity when using it detached from the Switch. But since the Hyperion 2 does not come with a center grip to hold the two parts together, I can’t fully recommend it as a Pro controller replacement until one becomes available – that’s a bummer because every other aspect of it works as a full gamepad alternative as well.
Check out our roundup of thebest Switch accessories!
While battery life is good, it’s not quite as long as the normal Joy-Con (on account of its more sophisticated features). The Hyperion 2 lasts around 10 hours without RGB lighting and about five hours with RGB lighting on. That’s plenty of juice to use wirelessly, but these are meant to be used in the Switch’s handheld form so that wasn’t a major factor for me. Charging is done by being attached to the Switch itself, and the design doesn’t interfere with the console being docked. However, the Hyperion 2 does consume a bit more battery from your system. It wasn’t a noticeable difference, although it’s worth noting – I’m not exactly a stickler for squeezing every minute of battery life from my Switch, so it didn’t concern me all that much.
The NYXI Hyperion 2 is available for $79.99 (the same price as the regular Joy-Con) directly fromthe NYXI website.
I wish the NYXI Hyperion 2 came around much sooner, because it’s the best aftermarket Joy-Con set I’ve used throughout the Nintendo Switch’s lifecycle. Its clicky mouse-like buttons are responsive and easy on the fingers, the grips fill up my hands comfortably without being hefty, and the Hall Effect analog sticks blow the Joy-Con sticks out of the water. The back buttons are super convenient, and the simple Turbo function came in handy in some rare instances. If it came with an attachable grip for better use as a gamepad alternative and had an easier way to map the back buttons, this would be an even better package. First-party Nintendo accessories tend to come at a premium, so relative to the competition and its high quality, the NYXI Hyperion 2 is reasonably priced at $79.99 (which is the same as a new pair of regular Joy-Con). Is it too late to pick up given that the Switch 2’s Joy-Con sport an entirely new design? Maybe. But if you’re still in the market for a new Switch controller, the Hyperion 2 is a smart choice."
"Thanks to a renewed focus on the ideas the series was originally built on, Shadows is the most satisfying Assassin’s Creed has felt in years. You can fluidly move from ground to castle rooftop thanks to the best parkour system since Unity, and a grappling hook only makes the journey to a great vantage point even speedier. Perched on a tightrope high above the enemy, you’re only a drop away from scoring the perfect kill… provided you’re playing as Naoe, that is. Take control of Yasuke, Shadows’ second protagonist, and it’s a whole different game.

Yasuke is slow. He is clumsy. He can’t kill silently. And he climbs like a grandpa. He is the antithesis of an Assassin’s Creed protagonist. He is one of Ubisoft’s most baffling design choices… and one of its most fascinating. Because when I play as Yasuke, I don’t feel like I’m playing Assassin’s Creed anymore.
I initially found this gulf between Yasuke’s ability set and the fundamental philosophy of the series to be incredibly frustrating. What is the point of an Assassin’s Creed protagonist who can barely climb and can’t perform a silent takedown? But the more I’ve played as him, the more I’ve seen merit in Yasuke’s design. He’s unquestionably flawed, but I think he addresses a couple of very important issues that Assassin’s Creed has struggled with over the past few years.
A brief starring role in Shadows’ prologue aside, you don’t get to play as Yasuke until several hours into the campaign. It means that your entire settling-in period is spent controlling Naoe, a swift shinobi who fulfills the “assassin” part of Assassin’s Creed better than any series protagonist has for a decade. Switching to Yasuke after playing as Naoe for so long is jarring.
This towering samurai is too big and too noisy to effectively sneak through enemy camps, and is barely capable of climbing anything higher than his own head. He cannot find a handhold in the jutting roofs that line Japan’s streets, and when you do find something he’s able to climb, he does so painfully slowly. On rooftops, he precariously balances on the apex, standing upright for all to see as he cautiously inches forward. These impairments to Yasuke’s climbing abilities introduce friction. Scaling environments can feel like a chore, with structures like scaffolding and ladders required to make any significant progress.
All of this doesn’t exactlyforceYasuke to stay at ground level, but it certainly encourages it. This in turn denies him vision; without easy access to high vantage points it’s difficult to map out an area’s threats and plan accordingly. And where a grounded Naoe at least has the enemy-highlighting Eagle Vision to fall back on, Yasuke has nothing. Take up his blade and you’re agreeing to sacrifice almost everything other than raw strength.
If this sounds not a lot like Assassin’s Creed, it’s because it isn’t. The series has thus far been built around parkour-led exploration. Even when it has delved into areas of history where buildings were rarely more than one or two storeys high, verticality is still a core part of the flow. Being robbed of the series’ traditional climbing freedom and forced to follow more prescribed routes makes time spent as Yasuke feel much closer to playing Ghost of Tsushima than Assassin’s Creed – a feeling only emphasised by Yasuke’s lack of stealth training and reliance on his samurai sword skills. Embodying Yasuke is to play a game that’s first and foremost about fierce combat, something Tsushima is fondly remembered for and Assassin’s Creed often criticised over.
To play as Yasuke is to be asked to rethink how to play Assassin’s Creed. Historically, the series has allowed us to climb anywhere. Previous assassins have been knife-happy Spider-Men, armed with sticky hands that allow them to scale everything from towers to glaciers as if they were ladders. It is effortless and, as a result, it offers no challenge whatsoever. Yasuke changes this. While it’s true that there’s a lot beyond his grasp, careful observation of the environment reveals hidden pathways that have been built especially to allow Yasuke to reach his objectives. For instance, a leaning tree trunk protruding from an overcrop can lead you to a sync point that would otherwise be inaccessible without a grappling hook. A castle may have an open window on the second floor, easily entered if you follow the staircase-like arrangement of the courtyard’s exterior wall. Such paths are arguably more interesting to decipher than the practically thoughtless scrambles of past games.
These pathways only take Yasuke where heneedsto be, though. He has much less freedom when it comes to general exploration, and it’s difficult to gain the high ground to observe enemy patrol patterns. But Yasuke really doesn’t abide by the traditional Assassin’s Creed approach of assessing guard movements and planning ahead. His only real stealth ability is the “Brutal Assassination” skill, and… well, it involves impaling an enemy on his sword, lifting them three feet off the ground, and yelling. Not exactly inconspicuous, is it? Rather than a takedown, it’s an opening move for combat, kicking things off with an instant kill. And when things do kick off, things get good. They getreallygood. Shadows boasts the best swordplay Assassin’s Creed has had in over a decade. There’s purpose to each strike and a rich variety of techniques to pull on – from brutal rush attacks to satisfying ripostes. Finishing moves cleave heads from shoulders, an image that creates a clear contrast between Yasuke’s abilities and Naoe’s stealthy approach.
But there’s more than just contrast here; the separation of combat and stealth into two characters means there’s less bleeding between the two styles. In Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, far too many quests used direct conflict as the default interaction. As such, action became their primary language. In Shadows, the twin protagonist system safeguards against that; Naoe’s relative fragility means she can’t go full slaughter mode, so when combat does break out you’re eventually forced to flee, reposition, and reset the stealth loop. When you want a break from that tension, Yasuke’s strength ensures you’ll be able to survive the worst Shadows can throw at you. It’s the power that he brings to the party that makes him such a tantalising prospect in combat, especially once his flashy skill tree full of abilities unlocks over time.
There’s strong intention within Yasuke’s design, then. But it’s nonetheless difficult to see where he fits into Assassin’s Creed – this is a series built on stealthy kills and vertical exploration, ideas that Yasuke is in direct opposition to. While it’s true that the likes of Bayek and Eivor stepped much too far into action territory, they were still able to perform the fundamental actions of an Assassin’s Creed lead character. They climbed to the apex of temples and wielded hidden blades. While it is thematically appropriate for Yasuke, who is a samurai and not an assassin, to be bad at stealth and climbing, his design simply means you can’t play Assassin’s Creed like Assassin’s Creed while in control of him.
The real problem Yasuke faces, though, is his ally. Naoe is just the better option. She is, mechanically speaking, the best Assassin’s Creed protagonist in many years. Her stealth toolkit is complemented by Sengoku Period Japan, which allows for the towering verticality of architecture the series has been missing since Syndicate. Combined, these elements allow for an experience that truly fulfills the promise of Assassin’s Creed: becoming a highly mobile silent killer.
Naoe also benefits from the design changes that shape Yasuke – while she can climb up to practically anywhere in the world, the “stick to every surface” mantra of the series has been scrapped in favour of something slightly more realistic. This means you still have to assess climbing routes and find anchor points for your grappling hook, but you can leap further and climb faster – these are the fundamental things that turn an open world into an Assassin’s Creed sandbox. And when you are on the ground and in the thick of it, Naoe’s combat flow feels just as ruthlessly violent and impactful as Yasuke’s. She benefits from all of the swordplay enhancements he enjoys, just with the caveat that she can’t endure battle for as long as her samurai friend can. All of this raises the question: why would you play as Yasuke when you can play as Naoe?
Due to its admirable intent to offer two distinct playstyles with Yasuke and Naoe, Ubisoft has created a double-edged sword. The African samurai plays by very different rules to a classic Assassin’s Creed protagonist, which creates a contrasting and reasonably compelling experience that’s a genuine first for the series. But he is undeniably in direct opposition to the ideas upon which these games were built – ideas that remain largely unique in the open-world genre. So while I’ll always find time to return to Yasuke’s shoes to enjoy the vicious thrill of his blade, it’ll be through the eyes of Naoe that I truly explore Shadows’ world. Because when I play as Naoe, I feel like I’m playing Assassin’s Creed.

"There’s a fine line between “I deserve this” and “this was a financial mistake,” and today’s deals are absolutely walking it. I’m looking at In Stock Pokémon bundles that practically dare you to stop at just one. Humble Choice is finally delivering a lineup that doesn’t feel like leftovers, and the Assassin’s Creed collectibles over in the IGN Store have officially moved from “maybe someday” to “I’ve added it to my cart twice already.”

In my opinion, these are the kinds of deals that are actually worth talking about — not the 7% off a charger you didn’t need to begin with. This is six-pack booster bundles available now, games I’ve had on my wishlist for too long, and statues that will silently judge you from a shelf while looking really, really cool. If you're going to buy stuff, at least let it be stuff that makes you happy and mildly ashamed.
From ourpreview: ""Based on the Loyal Three and their Moochi-feeding mythical master, Pecharunt, the Shrouded Fable set features some key players of thePokémon Scarlet & Violet DLC: Hidden Treasures of Area Zero, amongst new additions. It's a packed set, with Kingdra ex also making a royal splash in the expansion.""
This one’s a bit of a reality check. The actual MSRP for six of these packs is around $27, so Amazon is being bold by doubling that and calling it a deal. Still, given how hard Prismatic Evolutions is to find at retail without hunting down individual packs like a Pokédex-obsessed raccoon, this is sadly one of the better options right now. I wouldn’t call it a bargain, but if you’re just itching to crack open some fresh packs without resorting to third-party sellers, it gets the job done.
This is one of the few Pokémon TCG products still hovering close to MSRP, which basically qualifies it as a miracle in 2025. You get three solid booster packs, some stickers to slap on your laptop or emotional baggage, and a stackable tin that may or may not match the others in your accidental collection. It’s not flashy, but it’s a solid option if you just want some new packs to rip without playing the “Is this seller legit?” game.
This month’s Humble Choice doesn’t feel like a clearance rack, and that’s saying something. Tomb Raider is doing the nostalgia thing in the best way, and Dredge is that weird horror-fishing crossover I didn’t know I needed. Aliens: Dark Descent rounds it out if you like your sci-fi chaotic and stressful. Honestly, I’d pay the $12 just for those three — and still walk away feeling smug.
This bundle is a case of “available at a premium or not at all.” MSRP should be closer to $27, but good luck finding that price in the wild. The return of Shiny Pokémon is the big hook here, and that’s probably what’s driving the markup. I think it’s steep, but if you’ve been chasing the set and want to avoid eBay roulette, this is probably your safest play.
This is the kind of collectible that makes you pause and consider rearranging your entire shelf, your priorities, and your bank account. Some of these statues are genuinely beautiful. Others are so expensive they make me nervous just looking at them. But if you’ve got deep franchise loyalty and shallow impulse control, this is your moment.
Elite Trainer Boxes are rarely good dollar-per-pack deals, and this one’s no exception. But what you’re really paying for is the full kit: sleeves, promo card, storage box, and a mildly delusional sense of organization. I actually like this set for collectors who want more than just cards. It feels like a full-on project, and for $55, it’s one of the few Pokémon bundles that still comes close to feeling like it's worth the money.
This is the one I’d keep in my bag daily. It’s half an inch thick and can charge an iPhone 8 about 3.6 times or a Galaxy S22 almost twice. The USB-C port handles both input and output (a rarity at this price), and the dual USB-A ports mean you can charge multiple devices without carrying five bricks. It’s cheap, sleek, and has a literal paw print on it. Adorable and useful? Yes, please.
I think this is the sweet spot if you bounce between devices. You get three outputs, including one that’ll fast-charge a MacBook Pro 14"" or your Steam Deck while you’re multitasking. There’s even a pop-out phone stand built in. It’s like if your power bank also respected your time and your binge-watching habits. At under $40, it feels like a steal.
I picked up Death’s Door for five bucks and didn’t even hesitate. The Humble Store’s latest sale is packed with portable-friendly gems, perfect for a Steam Deck or travel laptop situation. Highlights include Dead Cells: Road to the Sea Bundle for $16.49 (50% off), Detroit: Become Human for just $11.99, and Dying Light Definitive Edition at $14.99. If your backlog needs more chaos, this is how you feed it on a budget.
This is my pick for weekend trips or carry-on duty. It’s got solid charging speed, a clean LED display that shows exactly how much juice is left, and enough capacity to last through a few full phone charges. It even handles smaller accessories like AirPods or smartwatches without flinching, which is more than I can say for some people.
This Gallica statue is up for preorder at $129.99, and yes, I want it just for the wings. It's 8.9 inches tall with glossy clear parts and Magla particles swirling on the base. The sculpt is absurdly detailed, which probably explains why I’ve already mentally cleared shelf space despite the fact it doesn't ship until November 2025. Patience is hard, but preorder now, panic later.
If I’m packing a laptop, a tablet, a phone, and something else probably unnecessary but still USB-powered, this is what I’m bringing. It hits 100W output, recharges itself fast via USB-C, and can handle charging multiple high-power devices at once. It’s a bit of a tank, but in the way you want when you're relying on it to keep everything alive.
If I had to pick a favorite just for everyday carry, it might be this one. It’s compact, fast, and charges three devices at once. I love the built-in phone stand, especially for killing time in waiting rooms or pretending I’m not watching TikTok in public. For $20, it’s a little charger that does a lot.
I don’t need six booster packs, but these are usually in and out of stock. ThisSurging SparksBooster Bundle has some fantastic chase cards, we're talking $400+ chase cards that could be in this Booster Bundle. It’s under $50, which in Pokémon terms is basically a clearance sticker. I'm not saying it'll change your life, but it might improve your afternoon.
This is the TV I’d buy if I wanted something that works without having to pretend I care about specs. It turns on, the picture’s 4K, it has Alexa so I don’t have to get off the couch, and it costs less than my last grocery run. Honestly, that’s more than enough.
I don’t usually gravitate toward games based on cartoons, but this bundle is stacked if you’ve got kids or just want a break from games that scream at you.Bluey, PAW Patrol, My Little Pony — the whole crew’s here, and honestly, they’re better made than half the AAA titles I’ve rage-quit. Pay $20 or more, get a pile of games, and support charity. Seems like a win for everyone except your free time.
I like this one because it feels unnecessarily large in the best way. You get Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and it still costs less than a concert ticket and a hoodie. If you want to make movie night feel intentional without spending your life savings, this does the job.
I want this on my shelf mostly so people ask what it is and I can pretend I understandDeath Stranding 2. It’s a 1/350 scale model of a massive mobile base from a game that hasn’t even released yet, and I respect the level of commitment required to care this much. It’s $69.99, which is fair for something this weirdly specific and detailed — and yes, the railgun is included.
This is the kind of TV I’d get if I wanted it to last longer than my attention span. It’s a 2024 model, has LG’s updated processor, and handles all the streaming stuff without having to download three extra apps just to log in. Feels like someone at LG actually thought it through.
I think this is what happens when Samsung realizes not everyone wants to spend $650 to track their steps. The titanium build is overkill in a good way, and the battery life means I don’t have to charge it every time I blink. It finally dropped to a price where it makes sense to buy one without feeling like I’m auditioning for a tech influencer role.
i’ve been watching theJourney TogetherElite Trainer Box like a hawk, and somehow it’s actually in stock at Amazon for $70.31. That’s 30% off apparantly, but it's not at all. It includes nine booster packs, a full-art N’s Zorua promo, sleeves, and the usual accessories, Most people just want the packs and the promo. If it’s gone when you check, keep trying. I’ve seen stock randomly reappear in the mornings and lunch time, just likeTarget's Journey Together stock.
Then there’s the Paldean Fates Booster Bundle at $69.77. Six packs inside, and the draw here is the return of shiny Pokémon. I like that it cuts straight to the good stuff — no sleeves, no dice, no cardboard fluff, just a clean bundle of packs ready to be cracked open. If you’re chasing shinies, this is where the hunt begins.
Humble Bundle’s “Best of Boomer Shooters 4” is live right now, and I love how chaotic it is. For $16, you get $174 worth of retro-inspired FPS games likeTurbo OverkillandForgive Me Father 2. I think of it as therapy, just with more blood and less talking about my feelings. You also support some good causes, so now your nostalgia trip is technically altruism. You're welcome.
Shrouded FableETB is holding steady at $54.96, and I think it’s slept on. It has nine packs, a Pecharunt foil, some sharp sleeves, and a player’s guide that you’ll absolutely ignore until you pull something weird and have to look it up. This set's all about the Legendary trio—Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti—and if you’re into building themed decks or hoarding off-meta cards, this one hits.
Finally, if your card obsession extends beyond Pikachu, the Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors’ Dreams trading cards are now up for pre-order on the IGN Store, starting at $20. I already pre-ordered a box because the idea of serial-numbered Chun-Li cards is somehow more exciting to me than it should be. Rare pulls, killer art, and a chance to relive the 90s one Hadouken at a time — I’m in.
I picked up one of the Paradox Clash tins just for fun and honestly, no regrets. For $39.96, you get five booster packs and either a Walking Wake EX or Iron Leaves EX promo, chosen completely at random. It’s a bit of a gamble, but opening tins is half the fun anyway. The promos are clean, the packaging is slick, and I think it makes a solid gift for anyone getting into the game
For a cheaper fix, I’d go for the $12.25 blister pack with three random boosters and a foil promo. It’s 39% off, which is honestly kind of wild, and it’s one of those no-risk purchases you can talk yourself into without too much guilt. The listing shows Silver Tempest Boosters, so there's a good chance of pulling some Sword and Shield chase cards here.This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.

"The Arkham Horror universe has a whole lot of games in its catalogue. In fact, there are so many to choose from that we’ve had to separate them into two guides. In this buying guide, we will go through the several families of board games. If you’re seeking information about the manydeck-building card gamesalso under the umbrella, you can click on over to ourArkham Horror: The Card Game Buying Guide.

Arkham Horror is an long-running franchise ofhorror board games. You and your fellow players embark on missions that involve a lot of communication to win. The games each have several pathways that can be taken depending on which roles, expansions, and campaigns you employ. These also make terrificsolo board gamesfor when you don't have a group on hand to spend an hour-plus playing a board game.
Want to skip the blurbs and go straight to the various games and expansions? Scroll through the catalog above. If you're interested in the nitty gritty of how all the items relate to one another and to the broad Arkham Horror universe in general, read on below.
Arkham Horror is acooperative board gamein which player teams work collectively against different sorts of terrors. You can take the journey through Arkham as one of six investigators to solve mysteries and defeat horrific beasts. The game has several campaigns to explore, and given the sizable luck component, whereby you have to roll to see if you pass certain objectives and bosses, along with the chance of chaos and occult trickery, well, the games are highly replayable.
But be warned: this is not an easy game. It takes a bit of time to set up and to teach to your group. The gameplay itself can last for multiple hours, or can be done fairly quickly if you and your ensemble of investigator partners aren’t lucky. (If you or your mates lose and there are fewer players than six, you can select another investigator to play as, but you’ll start over with that one, losing any additional stats that you’ve gained along the way. Dying kinda sucks, to be honest.) My first adventure with friends on the easiest campaign was disastrous. I’ve played it as asolo board game(yep, you can also do that here, too), but that didn’t go well, either. When you complete that first winning game, your whole party will cheer.
There are three expansions for the Arkham Horror: The Board Game. Each unlocks a different layer of depth to the base game.
The largest of the expansions is Under the Dark Waves. As the name suggests, this expansion is about the horrors that exist under the water. This big expansion brings eight new investigators on board for four new scenarios. It takes you out of the city and into the sea.
This is a medium-sized expansion that includes three new scenarios and three more investigators to travel through Arkham. Secrets of the Order opens up another neighborhood, so you'll explore French Hill while being mindful of the ghosts and monsters that may make your visit the opposite of a quaint French getaway.
Dead of Night is a smaller box expansion with a smaller price point to match. It has two more scenarios to add to your base game, plus four more investigators to help you navigate the horrors in the dead of the night.
There are a few other board games that act as their own separate Arkham universes. The games are not directly connected to Arkham Horror, so you don't need that base game to play them. Each of these games allows you and your friends to experience a different, stand-alone adventure within Arkham, using characters you may recognize from other iterations. Some of these titles are big enough to have expansions of their own.
Elder Sign was one of the first games in the Arkham Files franchise. It's adice-rolling board gamethat can be played by one to eight players. Of all the games in the Arkham Files, it’s the most accessible chance game. It is a separate standalone game with six physical companion expansions.
Gameplay is primarily governed by dice. While it’s not entirely like Yahtzee with monsters, rolling dice is the core driver of the game. You’ll have to roll dice to complete tasks and to work through six encounters. You roll dice depending on the stats of your chosen investigator to fight monsters, find clues, and work toward solving the mystery before time runs out.
Elder Sign has six expansions: Unseen Forces, Gates of Arkham, Omens of Ice, Grave Consequences, Omens of the Deep, and Omens of the Pharaoh. Grave Consequences is a standalone deck and can be played with or without the core game. The last expansion was released in 2018. It is currently unknown if there will be any more.
This is an app-drivendungeon crawler board gametake on the universe. The second edition is a standalone game that exists in the same universe as Eldrich Horror and Elder Sign. You can play it with one to five players using an app to help you through the narrative. The app guides you through setting up and playing the game. Narrative, roll results, and play direction can all be done in the app.
Personally, I dug playing with the combination of the tactical pieces and the app. And if you have to pause the game experience, the app allows you to come back later to finish where you left off. You’ll still have to set up your physical board game pieces when you play again, however, so you may want to take a picture to remember where everything should be.
There are two expansions for Mansions of Madness. Both of them are cooperative games that are guided by the app.
This expansion takes you to the depths of the jungle, where serpents and other Lovecraftian horrors will bring peril and pain to your adventure. Like the original, it is guided by an app, and you do need the base game to play it.
This expansion is significantly cheaper than the other one above. Beyond the Threshold opens two new investigators, two new scenarios, and an insanity gameplay element. Its low price point makes it the most accessible expansion to add to your game.
Unfathomable is about escaping a sea of monsters on a boat. It can be played with three to six players, though it’s best suited for groups of five or six. This game has a social deduction component, making it an immersive experience for larger groups. Someone is designated to be a traitor, and you won’t know who. It has Battlestar Galactica vibes to it, but in a Lovecraftian mythos atmosphere. Sessions take multiple hours while you navigate the game trying to figure out who among you is there to help and who wants you dead, while simultaneously trying to escape alive.
Unfathomable is a completely different experience than other games in the Arkham catalogue, making it sort of a love-it-or-hate-it type of deal. If you like Battlestar Galactica or other social deduction games, this may be a good option to explore.
This expansion introduces new prelude cards that offer varied starting conditions, as well as three new monstrous horrors (Shoggoth, the Drowned Spirit, and the Grasping Tendril), plus new skills, items, and boon cards.
Edrich Horror is a different, more worldly experience than the Arkham Horror board game. While Arkham Horror primarily exists in neighborhoods within the city proper (and the sea), Edrich Horror has players navigating cooperatively around the globe to complete objectives. Some have said that Eldrich Horror is like a sequel to a movie.
Some things have been changed and adjusted in Eldrich Horror that make it more accessible to beginner and mid-range gamers. It involves a far quicker setup than Arkham Horror does, which is an immediate plus for gamers who want to get things out and get playing quickly. Eldrich Horror also has simpler rules than Arkham Horror, making the ""teach"" a bit more entry-level-friendly.
That said, Eldrich Horror is more aboutstrategyand solving puzzles. Its first in the series was released in 2013.
There are eight expansions possible to play in Eldrich Horror. Those expansions are Forsaken Lore, Mountains of Madness, Strange Remnants, Under the Pyramids, Signs of Carcosa, The Dreamlands, Cities in Ruin, and Masks of Nyarlathotep.
There are a couple of other ways you can play in the Arkham universe outside of these standard board games. You can play a couple of the board games online. You can also try the franchise's first foray into the world oftabletop roleplaying games.
Arkham Horror released its first TTRPG late last year, with a starter set followed by a rulebook. I recommend trying the starter set first. Once you’ve gotten a feel for the rules and the game, you can choose to grab the rulebook to start your own journey.
The core starter set is super accessible for beginning players. It has a sample campaign to play through for folks who may be new to the TTRPG world, and does not require an experienced Game Master.
Once you've taken the starter set for a spin with your gaming group, you can pick up the Core Rulebook if you want to keep going on new TTRPG adventures in the Arkham Horror universe.
A digital version calledArkham Horror: Mother’s Embracewas released on Steam in 2021. It’s a single-player game that some might find similar to the Mansions of Madness board game expansion. Unfortunately, it only plays as a solo game. If you're open to solo treks into this universe, you can get this digital adventureon Steamoron Switchfor an MSRP of $19.99.
Solo or not, the digital version has gotten mixed reviews. IGN'sArkham Horror: Mother's Embrace reviewscored it a 5 due to lacking story execution. It fumbles with some heavy topics, which may deter some players from enjoying the Lovecraftian mythos.
There is also a digital version of Elder Sign available onSteamand mobile platforms. Elder Sign: Omens was released in 2011, but has received mostly positive reviews on Steam. It's quite affordable at only $5.99.
If you are a fan of Lovecraft mythos-themed games, as I am, Arkham Horror is absolutely worth exploring. One awesome thing is that you can play several of these games solo as well as with friends. They are each different and offer a unique presentation of the Lovecraftian worlds.
That said, these games are on the more difficult side. They have quite a bit of chance, which can drastically increase replayability as well as frustration. Setup and learning time can also take some time. You’ll find that the card games are easier to set up than the board games, even without expansions.

"Netflix's President of Games, Alain Tascan, is expecting a future generation that relies less on gaming consoles as major players like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo push forward with new hardware.

The lead of the streaming giant’s video game division shared his thoughts on how gaming fans might soon play their favorite titles during an interview withThe Game Businessthat took place following a Netflix presentation in San Francisco. During the event itself, Tascan was asked if the streamer had any intention of taking a crack at console gaming, but he’s not so sure younger gamers are even interested in what something like a PlayStation 6 could bring to the table.
“[When it comes to] console, we started to look at the future where the platform is agnostic,” he explained. “Look at the younger generation. Are eight year-olds and 10 year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6? I am not sure. They are wanting to interact with any digital screen, whatever it is, wherever it is, even in the car. With console you’re thinking about high definition, you’re thinking about the controller […] If we look at this older model, I think it will restrain us.”
Tascan told The Game Business that he’s got a soft spot for console gaming despite his concerns, specifically calling out Nintendo’s Wii as a personal favorite. He’s spent many years at studios such as EA, Ubisoft, and Epic Games in the past, so the idea of more traditional console game releases is far from foreign for him. For Netflix, though, things are trending in a different direction.
While the company has a proven track record for creating game adaptations for its IPs with subscription add-ons like Stranger Things 3: The Game, Too Hot to Handle: Love Is a Game, and more, it’s also experimented with giving users access to notable, familiar games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition. Each game can be played straight from a mobile phone if a subscriber chooses, and as Tascan clarified during that recent event, Netflix will be doubling down on this strategy as it develops party games and establishes itself as a hub for kids and gamer families.
“I am very vigorous about lowering friction and eliminating it if we can,” he told The Game Business. “I see that the subscription is friction as well. Maybe good friction because it makes business sense, but still we did the test of eliminating subscription for [mobile game] Squid Game: Unleashed. And we may do other tests.”
He continued: “But the other friction is having enough controllers for family. Having a piece of hardware that might be expensive, that’s another friction. Waiting for a game to download, that’s another friction. I am [looking at] all the obstacles, and asking if we can reduce them as much as possible.”
Netflix said in early 2024 that games engagement had tripled throughout 2023, signaling that it would continue investing in the space in the future after a 2021CNBCreport suggestedless than 1% of subscribers were tapping into its gamesofferings. In October 2024, the streaming giant cut back on its gaming ambitions when itshut down its AAA studio headed by former Overwatch, Halo, and God of War developers. AGame Developerreport from last month said cuts had also recently hit Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, a teamNetflix picked up in 2021.
As Netflix seeks to tap into a market that it expects to be uninterested in game consoles, there’s little reason to doubt we’ll see something like aPlayStation 6ornext Xboxfrom Sony and Microsoft, respectively. Nintendo, meanwhile, is teetering on the edge of a brand-new console generation with itshighly anticipated Switch 2 device. It will pull back the curtain on its new tech with a focused Direct presentation next week, with many fans expecting to hear more aboutwhat features the Switch 2 brings to the table, its release date, andhow pre-orders are being handled.

"Video game companies across Japan have suffered a dramatic stock market plunge sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

White House officials signalled what they describe as specific reciprocal tariffs on roughly 60 of the ""worst offenders"" to go into effect on 9 April. Japan is one of the countries subject to these customised tariff rates, at 24%.
Trump's officials say these countries charge higher tariffs on U.S. goods, impose ""non-tariff"" barriers to U.S. trade, or have otherwise acted in ways they feel undermine American economic goals.
Tariffs are essentially taxes placed on the cost of importing certain goods. While it's possible for companies in the supply chain to simply eat these costs, more often than not these taxes are passed onto consumers. And unfortunately for gamers, rising prices are very likely to impact tech and gaming goods.
Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark index closed down 7.8%, the ASX 200 in Australia lost 4.2%, and the Kospi in South Korea ended 5.6% lower. The Shanghai Composite closed 7.3% lower and Taiwan Weighted Index lost 9.7%. The Hang Seng was down by 12.5% in afternoon trading.
Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, rounded up the decline in video game stocks based in Japan as the market opening in the morning of April 7. Nintendo was down 7.35%, Sony 10.16%, Capcom 7.13%, and Sega 6.57%.
It's Monday 10am in Japan where Japanese game stocks currently react to these insultingly dumb tariffs like so:Nintendo -7.35%Sony -10.16%Bandai Namco -7.03%Konami -3.93%Sega -6.57%Koei Tecmo -5.83%Capcom -7.13%Square Enix -5.23%The mobile game companies do even worse.
Last week Nintendo shocked the video game world by announcinga delay to pre-orders of the Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S., blaming tariffs and the uncertainty they have caused across the world. The pre-orders were set to go live on April 9, but in the U.S. specifically they were postponed, with the June 5 release date said to be on-track. Pre-orders go live elsewhere on April 9 as planned.
Nintendo announced the Switch 2 at $449.99, with a Mario Kart World bundle priced $499.99.Mario Kart World itself is priced $79.99.
Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad had warnedthat Trump's surprise tariffs on countries such as Vietnam, where Nintendo had shifted some of its Switch 2 manufacturing in anticipation of U.S. tariffs on China, might have caused a rethink.
""While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset U.S. tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world,"" Ahmad said. ""The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect.""
Nintendo fansandanalystsare now concerned Nintendo will raise the price of the Switch 2 and its games even further, even asit suffers a backlash to its pricing following the console’s reveal.
There are question marks over Sony, too, which manufactures PlayStation consoles, including the $700 PlayStation 5 Pro. IGN has asked the company if it has any comment on the prospect of increased prices in the U.S.
Goldman Sachs now forecasts there is a 45% chance the U.S. will fall into recession in the next 12 months, up from a previous estimate of 35%. JPMorgan now sees a 60% chance of a U.S. and global economic downturn.
According to a report by theBBC, Trump has defended the tariffs, saying ""sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.""

"The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is the company's latestlaptop designed for the upper crust of gamers-on-the-go. It comes to market with your choice of an RTX 5080 or RTX 5090 (an RTX 5070 Ti version will be available later), while prices start at $3,099 and go up from there. Paired with its Intel Core 9 Ultra processor, it offers top-tier performance, gamer-friendly looks, and a great display. It’s not the laptop to choose for “thin and light,” but if you don’t care about that, it has a lot to offer.

The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is a flashy laptop with plenty of RGB and decorations to suit your fancy. Like many of the 16-inch launch models we’ve seen since Nvidia debuted its RTX 50-series laptop GPUs last week, it features a 2,560 x 1,600 OLED display with a boxier 16:10 aspect ratio than a normal widescreen laptop, and plenty of horsepower under its hood.
And AI, it has that too – and it wastes no time letting you know it’s there. Within minutes of booting it up for the first time, a notification was popping up from my “GiMate” assistant, letting me know that I should disable the Nvidia graphics card for better performance. AI is also interwoven with its configuration software, but more on that later.
The laptop is available in two configurations for now, separated by your choice of an RTX 5080 or RTX 5090 and about $1,200. Both versions come with the following specs, apart from the 5090 version which adds a second NVMe SSD for 2TB of total storage (you can add a second drive to the 5080 variant on your own if you’re tech-inclined):
Both models are expensive, but that goes with the territory when it comes to flagship gaming laptops right after a new launch. The RTX 5080 version I received to test costs $3,099. The RTX 5090 version will set you back $4,299. There’s also a larger Aorus Master 18 version of each that swaps the OLED screen for mini-LED and includes 2TB of storage by default. The RTX 5090 version there also bumps total system memory up to 64GB, which really isn’t bad for only $100 more than the 16-inch version ($4,399). The Aorus Master 18 with the RTX 5080 is a bit more marked up at $3,299, but at this kind of price, an extra hundo probably isn’t going to be the big decision-maker.
The Aorus Master is certainly designed to catch your eye and tempt a purchase in other ways. It’s an RGB showcase with an illuminated falcon logo on the lid, a wraparound 3D light bar, and even a small RGB projector that beams Aorus branding down onto your desk. The keyboard is also RGB, but it’s not per-key, which is disappointing at this price. Instead, it is broken into three zones and includes seven translucent keys that include WASD as well as Q, E, and R, with bright light passthrough. Even without per-key customization, it’s more than a little showy.
Everything but the lid is made from plastic. Functionally, it doesn’t make a huge difference, though an aluminum frame would be far better matched to its high price (and would help dissipate heat at the same time) and would have made it feel a bit more premium. The lid is very nice, however, and has a ripple pattern creating a wave pattern across its surface. It’s microtextured with such fine detail that you can only see it when it catches the light just so and feels smooth to the touch.
In fact, I first realized it wasn’t bead-blasted purely from sound. It reminds me of thezipyou get when you drag your nail across an old-school holographic Trapper Keeper. This quality makes it impervious to fingerprints in normal use, which immediately gives it a one-up on normal metal lids which tend to look grungy after a handful of uses.
The laptop isn’t thin and it’s not light. Unlike theRazer Blade 16which checks off both of those boxes while toting an RTX 5090, the Aorus Master is much more to expectation, measuring 0.9 inches at its thinnest and 1.14 inches at the thickest. It also weighs 5.5 pounds. Compare that to the Blade 16’s 0.69-inch front lip and 4.7 pound weight: it doesn’t seem like much on paper, but it’s immediately noticeable. Those small dimensional changes make the difference between “wow, this is surprisingly thin and light” and “yup, that’s definitely a gaming laptop.”
That extra space has its benefits, though. The Aorus Master offers both upgradeable memory and storage. There are two memory slots, allowing you to increase its capacity up to 64GB or swap out to a set with faster clock speeds. There are two M.2 slots for NVMe SSDs, so you can add extra storage without needing to reinstall Windows and drivers to get running again. Only the pre-populated slot supports PCI-e 5.0, however, so you’ll be limited to PCI-e Gen 4 for anything you’d like to add without formatting.
It also allows Gigabyte to go full-on with its other components. This machine is packing an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU with a full, 175-watt RTX 5080 (or other 50-series GPU). The processor is fast, topping out at 5.4GHz to maximize in-game fps and offers 24 cores (eight P-Cores and 16 E-Cores) cores for great multitasking performance and workload efficiency. It’s enough to make you wonder why Gigabyte only outfitted the laptop with 5,600 MHz memory when higher speeds would seem like the better match. The Razer Blade 16 uses 8,000MHz memory, for example, and higher memory speeds can directly translate into high fps.
To keep this hardware cool, Gigabyte has opted for a dual fan solution with densely packed, 158-fin fans. These come in new housing that's supposed to channel airflow better and also reduce their overall noise. It's still a gaming laptop, however, which means you should plan on hearing those fans quite prominently when you're running games. For web browsing and productivity use, it features a 0dB mode that relies on passive cooling when the components aren't generating as much heat. Like the Razer Blade 16, it features a large vapor chamber that covers more than 50% of the motherboard for improved performance overall.
The keyboard and trackpad are both decent. The keys have a generous amount of travel at 1.7mm and good tactility to avoid typos. I didn't find them to be especially mushy, but have experienced crisp typing experiences, such as the one on the Lenovo Legion 9i. Still, it gets the job done in a very familiar 75% layout that balances productivity and gaming performance.
The trackpad is also fine. It measures just over 5 inches by 4 inches and has a nice glide when swiping your finger across it. The integrated buttons work well, though I did find that left and right clicks could get a little confused the further up the trackpad you tried to make them. This is something that you get used to over time and is part of the process of learning a laptop. But taken together, the input experience is good but not particularly special in any way.
If you're planning on using the laptop for work or taking online classes, you can rest assured that it comes with a built-in 1080p webcam. In proper lighting conditions, it can look decent and offers a crisp, if slightly over-sharpened image. If you have a bright window behind you or are taking meetings in low lighting, it struggles to balance lighting and noise/grain in the image. There is no privacy shade, so you will have to manually turn it on and off if that's something you look for.
Audio quality is pretty typical for a gaming laptop. It uses four speakers total and they did a good job of getting loud enough to play games on, but their tiny size prevented them from sounding full for explosions or the bass register in music. You can use them if you need to, but agood gaming headsetis going to be the better choice for audio quality.
The Aorus Master 16 sports a 99WHr battery, which is the largest that can be used in a laptop currently. In our Procyon Office Battery Life test, it was able to run for seven hours and 49 minutes. With Advanced Optimus, Nvidia’s system for automatically swapping between the RTX 5080 and the integrated GPU, it meant that the test ran in its entirety without the full-powered graphics card turning on. When actually playing games, I averaged around two hours depending on how demanding the game was. RTX 50-series GPUs really seem to be coming into their own for gaming on battery.
Finally, for connectivity, it offers a decent array of ports to connect different peripherals and accessories. On the left side, it has a gigabit ethernet port, a full size HDMI 2.1, a USB 3.2 Type-A port, and a USB Type-C port capable of both charging and video, as well as a dedicated charging port for its included power bright. On the right is another USB Type-A and Type-C, an audio combo jack, and a microSD card reader. Size has its benefits.
In what's sure to be a trend this year, the Aorus Master 16 features a software suite that's integrated with AI. It offers all of the usual functionality, including setting your performance modes and fan settings, as well as customizing the laptop's RGB. For meetings, there are AI clarity enhancements as well as versions of the Windows Studio setting to blur your background and add artificial eye-tracking, as well as a privacy-enhancing feature that can turn off your screen when you’ve stepped away.
The most important feature that it offers is that it can intelligently control the performance of your system based on what you're doing. When you load a game, it's smart enough to know to use the RTX 5080 instead of the processor's integrated graphics chip, and then to switch that back over when you're done to save on battery life. There’s also a chatbot that you can engage with to get insights into your system, adjust settings, and converse with on troubleshooting, learning more about what settings do within Windows, and more. It’s essentially a local version of ChatGPT that knows about the specifics of your system.
While all of this is cool, it’s all pretty base level. Automatic performance switching is a nice feature, but if you’ve gamed on a laptop before, you already know to switch to its high performance mode. That the AI can detect a big workload also isn’t all that impressive, and swapping modes when it does isn’t something that requires “AI.” The chatbot can be fun, but unless you’re wet behind the ears when it comes to Windows gaming, it really feels like more of a novelty.
But we knew this was going to happen. AI is the trend of the moment and I expect most big laptop brands will follow suit with systems of their own. Use it if you like or ignore it if you don’t, both are viable options.
The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is in a class where performance is rightfully king, and whether or not it’s going to earn your dollars is going to depend a lot on what you’re coming from, what you’re hoping to achieve, and how much you have to spend.
Before sharing performance numbers, it's worth mentioning again that we'verecently upgraded our testing methodologyto better assess new technologies, rendering methods, and the performance demands of current games. Because of this, much of our prior testing data doesn’t align and we’ll be building up our data set over time. For this review, I’ll be comparing it to the Razer Blade 16 in the performance charts, but I was also able to do some testing with an RTX 4080 laptop on loan to remark upon in the text.
All of our tests are conducted at maximum settings. Upscaling is frequently used and is set to Quality at 1080p and Balanced at 1440p (or 1200p and 1600p in this case). These settings are also included in the charts.
Beginning with synthetic tests, we can see that the Aorus Master 16 performs quite well compared to the Razer Blade 16, despite the fact that it is running an RTX 5080 instead of an RTX 5090. Between the two systems, the Razer Blade is running an AMD Ryzen CPU, while the Aorus Master 16 is running an Intel Core Ultra CPU. This accounts for some of the differences here. However, it's also worth remembering that the Razer Blade 16 is power capped at 160 watts and frequently doesn't reach that limit, whereas the Aorus Master 16 can dynamically boost to the full 175 watt rating of the RTX 5080, pulling in higher performance.
What I find even more interesting is that in anecdotal testing against my end-of-last-gen Falcon Northwest DRX RTX 4080 system, the results are almost all close enough that you can chalk it up to margin of error. It's worth noting that the DRX system has a different processor, so the comparison isn’t exactly apples to apples. Still, the 40-series impresses. That doesn’t take away from the comparative performance of the 5080 versus the 5090, however, especially looking at that Night Raid score and its performance in real-world games.
Gaming benchmarks are just as revealing. Here we can see that at 1200p, the Aorus Master 16 outperforms the Razer Blade 16 with its power-capped RTX 5090. That’s shocking. At the same time, when I ran some of these tests against the Falcon Northwest DRX, the two went back and forth offering very similar performance in these games and beyond. The Blade 16 still pulls out some wins in a wider selection of playtests, averaging 62 fps in Black Myth: Wukong while the others hovered closer to 50, but there’s a serious value consideration here.
Now, an important caveatdoesneed to be given regarding the Razer Blade 16. It intentionally trades performance for portability, so it’s competing with a handicap. If you don’t care about it being as thin and light as possible, another RTX 5090 laptop may very well be a better choice. I’ll be testing exactly that in the weeks to come.
Another important consideration is fan noise. A loud laptop can draw unwanted attention and the Aorus Master 16, unfortunately, falls into that camp. Essentially, anytime you’re gaming, its fans will be running full throttle, and it’s loud enough to disturb a partner trying to watch a show in the room with you. I certainly wouldn’t play games in a library with it unless I could move well away from other people. Compared to the Blade 16, it’s much louder, which illustrates the competing visions for these products held between Razer and Gigabyte.
Here's the thing: Nvidia hasn't been shy about tying the 50-series to its AI capabilities versus pure native rendering performance. Though the RTX 5080 performs disappointingly close to the RTX 4080, this disappears when you're playing a game that supports multi-frame generation. While ""fake frames"" have become a bit of a meme, the fact is that when it works, it's pretty amazing and dramatically improves performance. This varies game to game based upon how well it handles latency. Alan Wake 2, for example, tends to feel a bit more laggy at higher multiplier settings while Cyberpunk 2077 does not. With this technology and others, like neural shaders, coming to future games, there’s an argument to be made about buying into these future technologies. But, you’re buying on a promise while Nvidia and game developers work to add support to new and existing games.
When it comes to living with the laptop on a daily basis, it offered snappy performance for just about anything I threw at it, including photo and video editing. I tend to prefer a laptop that's significantly lighter since I carry the laptop throughout my whole day; however, if you’re already used to carrying a gaming laptop, this won't feel very different. But, I would highly encourage anyone considering this to purchase a separate GaN charger for anytime you don't plan to play games. Its charging brick is big and heavy, and carried with the laptop brings the total weight to more than seven pounds. It was enough to leave me with a sore shoulder at the end of the day.
The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is available in two configurations at launch, one with an RTX 5090 and 2TB of storage at $4,300 and the RTX 5080 version tested here, which comes with a 1TB SSD for $3,100. It can be purchased fromAmazon,B&H,Newegg,Memory Express, andCanada Computers. Best Buy, and Micro Center are planned to offer availability in the future.
The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is a fine example of an RTX 50-series laptop, but as with our launch review of the architecture as a whole, it doesn’t make sense if you’re already running a 40-series gaming laptop. For anyone on an older system that wants high-level performance with access to features like Multi Frame Generation, that’s another story. Still, for such a high price, it’s hard to ignore the plastic frame, three-zone keyboard, and chonky build. If you’re after RTX 5090-esque performance for more than $1,000 cheaper, however, it’s a good way to save some cash while still getting those delicious, delicious frames."

"825 Forest Road is now streaming on Shudder.

Writer and director Stephen Cognetti is ready to be known as more than the “Hell House LLC Guy.” Unfortunately, his latest movie won’t help him accomplish that goal. 825 Forest Road ditches the found-footage Halloween scares of Cognetti’s directorial debut and its sequels for a more traditional approach to horror. Unfortunately, it's nowhere near as engaging or inventive as those four (and counting) trips to the cursed Abaddon Hotel. 825 Forest Road is a tangle of feeble lore, jumbled storytelling jumps, and an upsetting mannequin who’s scary, but can’t quite escape the shadow of the terrifyingly mobile clown dummies that stalk the Hell House movies.
The ingredients of his past success are all in place: 825 Forest Road brings a malevolent force and unsuspecting victims to the central location of the title. Chuck Wilson (Joe Falcone), his seamstress wife Maria (Elizabeth Vermilyea), and his artistic younger sister Isabelle (Kathryn Miller) leave tragedy behind to make a fresh start in the small town of Ashland Falls. But Ashland's darkest supernatural secret eventrually comes a-knocking at Chuck's front door: Her name is Helen Foster (Diomira Keane), and untimely deaths are her calling card. Cue the stock possession-horror thrills as the trio’s spacious yet surprisingly affordable home is infested by a vengeful spirit that Helen eventually channels into Maria's disturbing antique mannequin, ""Martha.""
There’s no visual imagination to be found in 825 Forest Road. Ashland Falls is portrayed like any other humble American community, no different from the settings of the 50 other scrappy little haunted-house movies you’ll see this year. The character Cognetti brought to Hell House LLC's monstrous attraction doesn’t extend to 825 Forest Road, either – with its architectural stuffiness and generic production design, the house might as well be an unoccupied model in the middle of a new housing development. And without the found-footage hook, the filmmaking lacks pop, sucking the life out of Chuck's residential nightmare.
Cognetti also miscalculates the durability of his storytelling, splitting 825 Forest Road into three repetitive chapters focused on a different member of the family. We follow Chuck, Irene, and Maria as they interact with Helen throughout the same sorta-spooky events, but the momentum is choppy at best – nothing revealed along the way is thunderous enough to be rewound multiple times. Cognetti struggles to bring his concept to life, whether it's Helen's underbaked backstory or the counterintuitive motivations that peg Chuck's crew as mindless cannon fodder. A few valiant efforts are made to prop up the exposition – like introducing the town's underground paranormal discussion group – but if the devil's in the details, he's on vacation.
I'll admit: Martha the mannequin – with her crackly,  papier-mâché complexion and habit of turning up where you least expect her – makes an effective antagonist. As Helen taunts the befuddled residents of 825 Forest Road by puppeting Martha around the house, Cognetti calls back to his nerve-shredding usage of Hell House LLC's bald-and-painted clown prop. The ghastly figure makes a good jump scare (when she’s not a shoddy digital effect), but 825 Forest Road is never scarier than when Martha gains mobility, scampering about like one of Donna Beneviento'sResident Evil Villageminions. So much of 825 Forest Road is a struggle, but not when Cognetti reminds us why Hell House LLC garnered a ravenous following addicted to blood-pumping terrors. If only the Martha material had a more powerful, lingering effect.
The rest of 825 Forest Road stumbles through the motions. The performances are a serviceable crop, but the cast doesn’t give you anything that'll stay seared in your memory. Cognetti recycles a few tricks from his Hell House LLC experiences, but they're less impactful without the intimacy found-footage can provide. Then there's the death blow of the final act, an anticlimax that fades to black at the worst possible moment. The kernel of an idea in 825 Forest Road never puffs into something tastier – it’s the hardened shell at the bottom of Cognetti’s bowl of savory found-footage frights. Perhaps the upcoming Hell House LLC: Lineage will prove a better method of closing the door on this chapter of his career.
825 Forest Road is an unimposing ghost story that resembles a first draft begging for revisions. Hell House LLC director Stephen Cognetti is able to string a few solid scares together here, but overall, his first feature-length excursion beyond the grounds of the Abaddon Hotel is a forgettable bore. There's nothing vital or remarkable about this run-of-the-mill haunted-house movie – its spirit-conjuring villain, Helen Foster, deserves better, frankly. You'll get your kicks from a manic mannequin come to life, but those moments have all the fleeting adrenaline rush of a pinprick."
"My Hero Academia came out at the perfect time, releasing just a couple of years before Infinity War, at the height of superhero dominance of pop culture. While Marvel movies were delivering world-ending stakes, the simplicity and relatively small scope of My Hero Academia felt new and refreshing even if it was familiar — especially to anyone who watched Sky High in the mid-'00s. The show is just a very effective battle shonen with everything you'd expect from a series in the genre, including memorable characters, themes about friendship and self-improvement, a sense of escalation, and stunning animation.

But most importantly, the show has an interesting portrayal of a world of heroes where superpowers impact every single aspect of culture and society. Like most shonen, there is plenty of supplementary material, like movies and original video animation (OVAs) and even spin-offs that expand the world of the anime. Whether you're just getting into the show or you want to see what you've missed along the way, here's how to watch My Hero Academia (including the movies) in order.
Adapting Kōhei Horikoshi's manga of the same name, My Hero Academia has been airing for seven seasons across almost a whole decade. In addition to the main show, there have been nine OVA's that expand the story, either with silly little side stories or adaptations of one-shot manga, as well as four movies.My Hero Academia: Vigilantes, which just started airing, is the first and only anime spin-off so far.
How about canon, though? Well, anything that doesn't directly adapt the manga, like the movies and most of the OVAs, aren't technically canon. Sure, they're fun and the movies do often tease some new power-up that is to come in the anime later on, but they're not necessary to the story.
Almost everything MHA, including every season of the show, most of the OVAs, and all four movies, is streaming on Crunchyroll. Thebest anime streaming service, Crunchyroll offers anad-supported free tieras well as aseven-day free trialof its Premium membership, which starts at $7.99/month. In the U.S., all seven seasons of My Hero Academia are streaming on Hulu, while the first four seasons are on Netflix. The My Hero Academia movies are also available as physical releases.

The first My Hero Academia OVA that was released feels like a blast from the past, an episode that is entirely about the students of class 1A and the teachers reeling from the USJ Incident from the first season. Now, the students are finally set to resume training, and they make groups as they are assigned to rescue each other, then face a fight against a villain.
Because the episode was only released in Japan at the annual Jump Festa fan convention celebrating the various Shōnen manga magazines, the OVA is full of funny fourth-wall breaks and nods to the audience.
Teacher Aizawa is a little bit unorthodox. In this second OVA, he decides to throw his students headfirst into a training exercise with students from the Isamu Academy High School – which spirals out of control when one of the students (named Romero in a touching tribute to the father of modern zombies) uses his Quirk and turns a whole bunch of people into zombies. What was meant to be a simple exercise about survival turns into a proper zombie apocalypse. The OVA has some hilarious moments like seeing the panic in Deku's eyes when he sees All Might in his weakened state, only for everyone to think he's a zombie.
While this OVA could have technically kicked off the timeline, it's best enjoyed as a prologue to the Two Heroes movie it released alongside. This is as close as we got to a proper All Might prequel, and it is delightful to watch All Might rise from a grieving student who just lost his teacher to becoming the ever-smiling Symbol of Peace we know and love.
Thefirst My Hero Academia moviesets the winning formula that would follow in every movie in the franchise since. What starts out as a fun getaway vacation where Deku accompanies All Might to visit an old friend of the hero ends up as a big test to Deku as the floating island is taken hostage by a villain. This is the movie for All Might fans as we learn a bit more of his origin and his time in America.
Why does every Class 1-A training exercise end in disaster? This time around, the entire abandoned mall that the teacher decided to set this training in starts to collapse and the training exercise quickly becomes a fight for survival. These episodes are really for those who don't like that the main story moved away from the school part of the story too quickly, and delivers the kind of Saturday Morning Cartoon-type school shenanigans of the earlier seasons.
This is by far my favorite My Hero Academia movie to date.Heroes Risingshowcases Class 1-A working together as proper heroes without relying on a mentor, a cool location, and also a cameo from the best hero, Godzillo. Most importantly, this movie is a treat for Bakugo and Deku fans, giving us more insight into their relationship and dynamic. It also has the best climax of any of the movies by having Deku and Bakugo work together and deliver a phenomenal joint attack.
This is another short OVA, and one that actually adapts a one-shot from the manga. It is mostly a comedy sketch about Hawks that ties into the next movie, but what makes it stand out is its stunning animation.
This movie has the highest stakes of the movies up to this point and a cool visual style, but what really makesWorld Heroes' Missionspecial is the introduction of best boy, Rody. He instantly becomes one of the best characters in the franchise and seeing his dynamic with Deku is fantastic. Timeline-wise, this is the one place My Hero Academia gets a bit funky, as the anime deviates from the manga.
What if our favorite heroes had to stop a criminal whose power made everyone around him laugh uncontrollably? That's the simple but sweet premise of this OVA, which is one of the funniest episodes of My Hero Academia. The villain is essentially a Joker type who makes everyone laughs and he is a treat to watch, even if the episode itself doesn't offer much that we hadn't seen before.
A baseball episode! A classic trope of the anime medium, and one that My Hero Academia does spectacularly. Sure, there are few surprises to be had, but that's fine, because the fun is just watching the wild display of Quirks used for something as mundane as a sports match.
What if My Hero Academia turned into Yu-Gi-Oh? Bored during Winter Break and sequestered in their dorms, the 1-A students pass the time by playing a new heroes card game. It's essentially an excuse to show the characters battle each other (in a VR recreation of the card characters battling it out), but it is great ""what if"" fun – like seeing All Might fight… a dog.
Deku is a huge hero nerd, that much audiences have known from the start, but sometimes the anime seems to forget about it. That's where A Piece of Cake comes from, adapting a one-shot manga that's all about the 1-A students discovering Deku's journal with extensive notes about their Quirks, and having wild reactions to his tips, suggestions, and silly drawings. It's a fun rest in what's otherwise a rather bleak chapter in the story, and a fun side story where the kids get to be kids (possibly for the last time).
Thelatest My Hero Academia moviehas some jaw-dropping visuals and a great final fight. The story introduces fascinating characters, including an anti-All Might villain as well as a new protagonist that has great chemistry with our main heroes.
My Hero Academia is reaching its end. Thefinal season of the showwill begin airing this October, but for those who aren't ready to let go of this universe, fret not. There are bound to be more OVAs or movies in the future.
In the meantime, we do have the spin-off series, Vigilantes, to enjoy. The My Hero Academia spin-off takes place five years before the events of the main series, has a darker and more mature tone, and features appearances by some fan-favorite characters.The first episode of My Hero Academia: Vigilantes is now streaming, and the season will consist of 13 episodes total.

"David Lynch was one of thebest guysto ever do it. From any of his very good films, Twin Peaks the TV series, tohis unmissable weather reports, Lynch left behind a trove of beloved and rewatchable, if occasionally inscrutable, work that will hold up for years and years. (I'll say it: His Dune was good.)

If a theater near you is showing his films afterhis death earlier this year, you should absolutely go – I saw Mulholland Drive on the big screen for the first time in January and boy, what a treat. If you can't get to a theater, are worried that his work will beindiscriminately pulled off from streaming, or simply want to build out your own personal Lynch library, now's a good time to stock up. Most of Lynch's oeuvre in Blu-ray/4K is getting a healthy discount as part of Amazon's Spring Sale. The only real misses from his films areBlue Velvet, with a measly 8% discount, andWild at Heart, which is honestly already a pretty cheap Blu-ray. Unfortunately, none of these are part of the ongoingBuy 2, Get 1 Free promotion, but it's more than worth paying a little extra to make these your own.

"At Sony Pictures’ presentation at CinemaCon on Monday, director Sam Mendes revealed the release strategy for his upcoming quartet of movies about The Beatles – dubbed The Beatles – A Four-Film Cinematic Event – and officially announced the actors playing the Fab Four.

Harris Dickinson (Babygirl) plays John Lennon, Paul Mescal (Gladiator II) plays Paul McCartney, Barry Keoghan (The Batman) plays Ringo Starr, andJoseph Quinn(The Fantastic Four: First Steps) plays George Harrison.
The Beatles – A Four-Film Cinematic Event will be in theaters April 2028. The exact release dates and the order in which each Beatle’s film will be released wasn’t disclosed. Mendes said he envisions the movies being seen in a particular order, but won’t reveal that yet.
The official logline declares: “Each man has his own story, but together they are legendary.”
Mendes said each film is told from the perspective of one of the Beatles but that each intersects in their own way, and that seeing all four films in proximity tells the full story in a totally unique way.
“We need big cinematic events to get people out of the house,” said Mendes, who also produces along with Pippa Harris, Julie Pastor, and Alexandra Derbyshire.
Mendes said they will be in principal photography for just over a year.
The Beatles – A Four-Film Cinematic Event is a Neal Street production in association with Apple Corps for Sony Pictures.

"Based on an actual incident from the Iraq War, Warfare is an especially effective and visceral depiction of modern combat. Only those who were there can say whether it’s a 100% realistic recreation of those events: Co-directors Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza have been careful to note that the grueling images they’ve put onscreen are the “memories” of Mendoza and his fellow U.S. Navy SEALs, who were trapped in a Ramadi apartment during a surveillance mission gone awry in 2006. Memories, of course, can be skewed or have their own gaps or inaccuracies. But there’s no arguing that the recollections dramatized by Warfare are undeniably engrossing – no matter how difficult and upsetting they are to watch. And they are difficult and upsetting to watch: Warfare is arguably among the most extreme “war is hell” movies ever made by an American studio.

After spending the past decade working as an advisor on projects including Jurassic World, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Garland’s 2024 filmCivil War, Mendoza brings an uncommon level of personal experience to Warfare. Garland’s filmmaking prowess is crucial here as well: Part of what makes Warfare so effective is how it plays (and sounds) like the kind of blunt, dread-filled horror movie the28 Days Laterscreenwriter andAnnihilationdirector made his name on.
After a quiet set up, all hell eventually breaks loose for Ray (played onscreen byReservation Dogs’ D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai) and his platoonmates. And when it does, things get truly horrifying. Warfare shows that no matter how well trained and skilled you are, there’s no controlling the chaos of an armed ambush or your reaction to a nearby explosion. The moment when things truly turn sideways for the group is absolutely brutal, filled with disturbing imagery of the dead and terribly injured and the shock on the faces of those who survive.
If this doesn’t exactly sound like the type of fun or excitement we might typically seek from a night at the multiplex – well, it’s not. Warfare is the type of technically impressive – and well worth seeing – movie that’s challenging by design. The idea is to put you in these men’s shoes as best as a movie can. In this regard, Warfare has an impact that I found hard to shake.
Essentially told in real time, and mostly set within a single building, the methodically-paced build-up shows the SEALs – played by familiar faces from various MCU projects, celebrated FX series, Netflix dramas and more – hunkered down in the apartment they’ve commandeered from an Iraqi family. Scenes of them handwriting notes, urinating in water bottles, and stretching after long spells of crouching behind a sniper rifle accomplish Warfare’s goals of immersion. These lived in, mundane, and even tedious early moments play out in the ever-present shadow of lethal danger – and the fear that, any moment, a bullet (or bullets) could come flying into the apartment.
That nerve-rattling atmosphere is intensified by Warfare’s incredible sound design. Devoid of any musical score, the combat scenes go sonically wild and surreal: Sound designer Glenn Freemantle drops the volume low and the audio becomes distorted when the characters can barely hear, but there are also moments that are so loud, it’s almost too much to endure. And that’s clearly the point: Eventually, one of our main characters, having been injured in a particular ghastly manner, begins screaming at the top of their lungs in nonstop agony, and it’s nearly unbearable. But it’s also necessary to get across what these people are suffering through.
When it comes to depicting the Iraqi civilians caught in the middle of all this, there issometime spent with the two scouts accompanying the SEALs on their mission, who express their rational, validated fears about what could occur. Warfare doesn’t shy away from the stark reality of how awful and traumatizing things are for the family living in the apartment, either. These people have the terrible luck of living in a place taken over by American soldiers who show no outward hesitation when it comes to endangering innocent lives – children included. With those soldiers providing our main point of view, it’s frustrating that we don’t get to know the family in any detail, or truly explore their viewpoint. Still, it’s clear that Mendoza and Garland are aware that for the inhabitants of the apartment, the SEALs themselves are like something out of a horror movie, and they don’t attempt to sugarcoat it.
Casting here is crucial. These are simply defined characters without a trace of backstory or motivation, and Warfare asks us to invest in themquickly. Garland and Mendoza do a terrific job, stocking their cast with recognizable, up-and-coming, acclaimed actors like Will Poulter, Noah Centineo, Cosmo Jarvis, Kit Connor, Michael Gandolfini and Joseph Quinn. (Though there is some irony that many of these actors are, like Garland, Brits telling a deeply, unfortunately American story.) They’re able to convey the humanity and vulnerability within these guys – and let us understand, for instance, why someone who is usually clearly very capable suddenly freezes up in the face of such overwhelming odds. Charles Melton is also well cast as the leader of a second group of SEALs we meet later on, exuding the determination and gravitas this character needs to provide.
Warfare is the kind of film where you’re sitting holding your breath, tensed up, for much of the run time. (94 minutes, in case you’re wondering whether or not it’ll be too much to endure.) Which means the rare moments of comic relief – including one darkly funny moment of accidental physical comedy in the midst of chaos – have all the more impact, thanks to the necessary release of tension. It’s easy to imagine this was the case for the characters’ real-life inspirations, too. Because if war is hell, you take a chuckle where you can get it.
A darkly effective sensory overload, Warfare does a strong, stripped-down job of placing us into the midst of a notably intense and confined few hours of surveillance and combat. A strong cast of rising stars sells their characters’ mixture of fear and determination, while phenomenal sound design plays a big role in the immersiveness as we’re given a window into just how nightmarish and disorienting a combat experience like this can be."
"Mortal Kombat 1’s T-1000 update has added the iconic Terminator 2 villain to the fighting game, and with it revealed how the developers at NetherRealm have handled its liquid metal form in the face of the series’ trademark Fatalities.

The gory fighting game franchise is famous for slicing and dicing characters in all sorts of gruesome ways, ripping out organs and even complete skeletons. Some characters tear the very soul from their hapless foe’s body, or break bones every which way possible.
But none of this should work on the T-1000, right? The T-1000 is made entirely out of a liquid metal called mimetic polyalloy, meaning it can reform into any shape it touches of the approximate size. And that’s exactly how the T-1000 works in Mortal Kombat 1, with his moveset, Fatalities, and Brutalities all in keeping with the character’s movie rules.
Of course, when it comes to damage being done to T-1000 in the game, some of those rules had to be broken. But as players have discovered, the developers at NetherRealm have done a fantastic job creating a custom look for the T-1000 when it’s on the receiving end of Fatalities and other devastating attacks.
X / Twitter user@daehnnypublished a series of videos showing how the T-1000 reacts to being torn to pieces. We see that in Mortal Kombat 1, the T-1000 melts as it does in the movies.
Mileena will eat anything!pic.twitter.com/FNkvtKFRut
But we also see that in Mortal Kombat 1, the T-1000 has a skeleton of sorts and even an intestine. And, not to get too philosophical, but in the world of Mortal Kombat 1, the T-1000 has a soul.
But he does have a soul!pic.twitter.com/nDexvb6RVN
There are some cool visuals at play here, with a dissolve effect for the T-1000 that makes the character look a little more unique than it would otherwise.
I like how the skeleton dissolves in the endpic.twitter.com/w53f00DGlu
Apparently Quan Chi spells work on any kind of machinepic.twitter.com/DdJxYmB2BQ
And yes, it turns out even the relentless T-1000 has a heart.
Turns out even he is capable of loving. T-1000 has a heart#confirmedpic.twitter.com/KilRsllwam
There are also unique effects for when the T-1000 is on the receiving end of a Fatal Blow, and we see the character turn to liquid form when it's ""dead,"" which is a cool detail.
and this is how the Fatalities look:he turns completely silver when he’s supposed to be dead, such a neat detailpic.twitter.com/Z3KTMhbTD8
Of course, none of these Fatalities and Fatal Blows would actually kill the T-1000 were Mortal Kombat 1 playing by the rules established by the films. But then, Mortal Kombat 1 has never really made much sense. It’s about over-the-top, laugh-out-loud violence, and there’s no reason the T-1000 shouldn’t get in on the fun.
Meanwhile, Mortal Kombat 1 players have been working out the T-1000’s Brutalities, and there are some cool Easter eggs in there, as well as references to Terminator 2 itself.
Spamming some input will turn T-1000 into liquid form after brutality, I'm unsure of the input but i managed to trigger it a few times.@thethiny@iScreamFGC@interlokopic.twitter.com/BJEueaOKLN
T-1000 is the final DLC character in the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about the 5 million-selling Mortal Kombat 1’s success.
Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things,the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat.
And just this week, NetherRealm offered a first look at skins based on the Mortal Kombat 2 movie that are coming to Mortal Kombat 1 at some point in the future.
Here's is a sneak peek at the MK2 movie skins in Mortal Kombat 1 🐉Koming later this year.pic.twitter.com/51Bkq6wGbX
In September, Mortal Kombat development chiefEd Boon said NetherRealm had decided on its next game three years prior, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”

"Kirby has been a steadfast Nintendo mascot for 33 years, ever since the character debuted in 1992’s Kirby’s Dream Land for Game Boy. In addition to being a Smash Bros. staple, Kirby and his ever-evolving powers of inhalation have starred in over two dozen games, culminating in the series’ best-selling game to date, Kirby and the Forgotten Land.

As we near the end of Nintendo’s current console generation, we’ve compiled a list of every Kirby game on the Switch as well asnew Kirby gamescoming to the Switch 2.
Six Kirby games have been released on Nintendo Switch, while 11 more retro Kirby games are playable withNintendo Switch Online. The franchise debuted on Switch in 2018 with Kirby Star Allies; its latest release, Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe, arrived in 2023. A new Kirby game,Kirby Air Riders, will be releasing for theNintendo Switch 2in 2025.
Kirby’s Switch debut came in 2018 withKirby Star Allies. The action-platformer is played with a party of four (multiplayer or local AI) and sees Kirby combine abilities with allies to solve puzzles and enhance combat.
Series developer HAL Laboratories and Nintendo brought the pink puff back the following year for the free-to-playSuper Kirby Clash. Like Star Allies, Clash is played with a team of four that can be controlled by other human players or AI. Unlike Star Allies, this is not a platformer but rather a standalone boss rush mode; it features a hub world for changing equipment and selecting quests, though the heart of the game is the series of boss fights that serve as those quests.
A sequel to the 3DS game Kirby Fighters Deluxe (an expanded version of the subgame Kirby Fighters found in Kirby: Triple Deluxe),Kirby Fighters 2is exactly what it sounds like: a fighting game starring Kirby. It supports up to four players and features Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede, Bandana Waddle Dee, Gooey, and Magolor as playable characters.
The series’ standout game on Switch,Kirby and the Forgotten Landis a post-apocalyptic adventure in which Kirby gets sucked into a wormhole that appears above Dream Land. The Forgotten Land is the series’ first fully 3D platformer, complete with puzzles and Kirby’s signature ability-based combat. It’s the series’ best-selling game to date, selling more than 7.5 million copies by the end of March 2024. There's even a Switch 2 version of this game currentlylisted to be available for preorder.
Kirby’s Dream Buffetis a dessert-themed multiplayer game released in 2022. It features three four-player game modes: race, minigame, and battle royale. The modes can be played separately or together as part of Dream Buffet’s Gourmet Grand Prix.
The series’ latest game,Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxeis a remake of the 2011 Wii game Kirby’s Return to Dream Land. The action-platformer came to Switch with improved visuals, a new easy mode (Helper Magolor), three new abilities (Sand, Mecha, and Festival), and an all-new two-hour adventure called Magolor Epilogue: The Interdimensional Traveler.
Return to Dream Land Deluxe supports local co-op for up to four players, with each player taking control of either Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede, or Bandana Waddle Dee.
There are 11 Kirby games available with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Those with a regular subscription can play nine Kirby games from NES, SNES, and Game Boy, while those with the more expensive Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription get access to two additional games: Kirby & The Amazing Mirror (GBA) and Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards (N64).
Here’s the list of Kirby games playable with Nintendo Switch Online, ordered by initial release date:
Anew GameCube librarywill also be available in the NSO + Expansion Pack membership on Switch 2, which may include Kirby Air Ride.

The era of Kirby on Switch may be coming to a close, but the character's journey on the Switch 2 has just begun.Kirby Air Riderswas officially announced during theApril 2025 Nintendo Directas a follow-up to the 2003Kirby Air Ride racing gameon GameCube. Masahiro Sakurai, creator of both the Kirby series and Super Smash Bros., returns as director of the new game.
Kirby and the Forgotten Land is also on the list of games that will be gettingSwitch 2 upgrades. The upgrade will take advantage of the Switch 2'simproved specsand includes a new story expansion. Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World will be released on August 28 with a discounted upgrade option for those who owned the original game on Switch.

"After a press tour that recently featured Jack Quaid looking progressively more beat up ata Clippers game, Novocaine has arrived in theaters. The R-rated action comedy stars Quaid as a man who feels no pain, so it's starting to seem like 'The Boys' veteran goes out of his way to get covered in fake blood.

In herreview for IGN,critic Lena Wilson states that “Novocaine offers more depth than its gimmicky 'man who feels no pain' premise may lead you to believe,"" with ""clever storytelling and character writing that reminds us of a time when seeing movies in theaters was just plain fun.”
If you're planning to catch Novocaine in theaters or want a sense of when the movie will be available to stream, check out the details below.
Novocaine just released in theaters. You can check for showtimes near you at the main theater links below:
Novocaine will eventually stream onParamount+instead of Netflix or Hulu. RecentParamount movies, like Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Gladiator 2, arrived on the streaming service about three months after releasing in theaters. Assuming the new action comedy follows a similar release schedule,Novocaine will likely be streaming on Paramount+ by late June.
Novocaine is an original action comedy movie about a man who can't feel pain. Here’s the movie’s official synopsis:
When the girl of his dreams gets kidnapped, a man turns his inability to feel pain into an unexpected advantage as he fights a bunch of thugs to get her back.
Novocaine was written by Lars Jacobson and directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen. The movie stars the following actors:
Novocaine is Rated R for strong bloody violence, grisly images, and language throughout. The movie runs for a total of one hour and 50 minutes."
"Scarlet Witch actress Elizabeth Olsen has suggested she will not be in eitherAvengers: Secret WarsorAvengers: Doomsday.

Marvel Cinematic Universe fans had hoped to see The Scarlet Witch return following the events ofDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.
Warning!Spoilers for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Agatha All Along Season 1 follow.
Scarlet Witch apparently died at the end of the 2022 MCU film andfailed to make a dramatic return in Disney+ show Agatha All Along, much to the disappointment of fans.Olsen had saidshe’d be up for playing Scarlet Witch once again, “if there’s a good way to use her.”
Then,MCU boss Kevin Feige issued a tease that got Scarlet Witch fans excited. “We had Agatha Forever on Disney+ just now, and that series was great for us,” he said. “Since then, there have been a lot of questions about Wanda on fans' minds... So all I can say is that we're excited to find out when and how the Scarlet Witch might return.”
If that return to the MCU does happen, it apparently won’t be in Avengers. Speaking toThe Hollywood Reporter, Olsen insisted she won’t be in London for the filming of the Russo brothers’ two upcoming Avengers movies, Doomsday and Secret Wars.
Why? She wants to focus on her non-Marvel movies right now. Doomsday and Secret Wars will soon start shooting in London via back-to-back productions, whereas Olsen is about to film a pilot for FX drama Seven Sisters.
Is this a ruse? Could Olsen be offering a diversion in her response to The Hollywood Reporter’s question? It wouldn’t be the first misleading misdirection from a member of the MCU’s cast. Perhaps everyone wants Scarlet Witch’s involvement in Avengers to be a big surprise if and when it happens, and ruling it out in interviews will help.
Here’s what we know: Iron Man actorRobert Downey Jr. is set to return as Doctor Doom, andBenedict Cumberbatch returns as Doctor Strange in Secret Wars. Elsewhere, we have vague rumblings about who will turn up in the film, with everyone from The Fantastic Four to the Thunderbolts rumored to be in the cast.
All eyes will be on London to see which MCU stars are in town when the filming takes place. Expect plenty more reports from eagle-eyed fans to hit the internet in the coming months.
The MCU rumbles on regardless.Thunderbolts*comes out in May 2025, TV showIronheartis out in June, and Phase 6 kicks off withThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsin July.
Earlier this month,the Russo brothers said they see Avengers 5 and 6 as a “new beginning”that will lay the foundation for whatever comes next in Phase 7 of the MCU.
“The only thing I’ll say about the movie is this: we love villains who think they’re the heroes of their own stories,” Joe Russo said. “That’s when they become three-dimensional and they become more interesting. When you have an actor like Robert Downey, you have to create a three-dimensional, well shaped character for the audience. That’s where a lot of our focus is going.”
Avengers: Doomsday is currently set to arrive in theaters May 1, 2026 and Secret Wars arrives about a year later in May 2027.
Late last year, Feige teased the introduction of X-Men characters in the ""next few"" MCU movies. Feige told an audience at the Disney APAC Content Showcase in Singapore that fans would see “some X-Men players that you might recognize” in the next few MCU movies, but he stopped short of saying which characters or what movies.
On bringing the X-Men into the MCU, Feige added: “I think you will see that continues in our next few movies with some X-Men players that you might recognize.
“Right after that, the whole story of Secret Wars really leads us into a new age of mutants and of the X-Men. Again, [it’s] one of those dreams come true. We finally have the X-Men back.”
Feige has also said the X-Men will be an important part of the MCU’s future following Secret Wars. ""When we were preparing for Avengers: Endgame years ago, it was a question of getting to the grand finale of our narrative, and then we had to start all over again after that,” Feige said. “This time, on the road to Secret Wars, we already know very well what the story is going to be until then and afterwards. The X-Men are an important part of that future.”
In October, Marvel Studios added three untitled movie projects to its 2028 release schedule: February 18, 2028; May 5, 2028; and November 10, 2028. It seems increasingly likely one of these movies is X-Men.

"The future of the MCU is starting to take shape. DirectorsAnthony and Joe Russohave teased howAvengers: DoomsdayandAvengers: Secret Warswill differ from their last two projects in the franchise, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.

During an interview with Brazilian outletOmelete, the directing brothers revealed that they see Avengers 5 and 6 as a “new beginning” that will lay the foundation for whatever comes next in Phase 7 of the MCU.
""The greatest thing that ever happened is we got to get immersed in a 20 movie arc and see an ending to that arc,"" Joe Russo said. ""What's compelling about these two new Avengers movies is they're a beginning. It's a new beginning. We told an ending story [with Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame] and now we're going to tell a beginning story. Who knows where we’ll go from there?""
The pair also opened up about how they ended up back in the Marvel world tackling another Avengers story. “We didn’t know what our road forward was in the MCU after we finished Endgame,” Anthony Russo explained.
“What happened was, a creative idea just came to us and that ended up feeling like the right idea. It motivated us to do it again. We feel like we have something fresh, we feel like we have a story that’s important and needs to be told. We have an amazing group of collaborators again, some old and some new. We’re very excited.""
He also noted that Doomsday is a “difficult” movie because of the “expectations on it” to help bring theatergoing back to its pre-pandemic glory. That said, the Russos also revealed it was Marvel producer Kevin Feige’s ideato bring Robert Downey Jr. back for Doomsday.
“That conversation was had a while ago, and Robert tried to talk us into doing it and we said no,” Joe said. “We just didn’t have a story, we didn’t have a way in, so we were resistant for a while. And then one day, [Endgame writer] Steve McFeely called us and said, ‘I have an idea.’ ”
“The only thing I’ll say about the movie is this: we love villains who think they’re the heroes of their own stories,” Joe Russo closed out the interview. “That’s when they become three-dimensional and they become more interesting. When you have an actor like Robert Downey, you have to create a three-dimensional, well shaped character for the audience. That’s where a lot of our focus is going.”
Avengers: Doomsday is currently set to arrive in theaters May 1, 2026 and Secret Wars arrives about a year later in May 2027, so unfortunately, we’ve got a lot of waiting to do before we can see what the Russo brothers are cooking up.
Late last year, Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige teased the introduction of X-Men characters in the ""next few"" MCU movies.

It sounds like Phase 7 of the MCU will be dominated by the X-Men, then, but in the short term, Storm appeared inWhat If...? Season 3, marking the character’s first appearance in the wider MCU.

"It’s no secret that the latest Marvel film,Captain America: Brave New World, didn’t exactly light the world on fire in terms ofcritical response, fan response, or box office. In fact, on the latter front some folks have been doom-watching as Brave New World limps along, making money each weekend since its release, but not really makingMCU money.

The thing about Hollywood movie budgets is it’s always difficult to track how much money actually went into a film. Yes, budgets will be cited by “studio insiders” and the like, but there’s no real way to know how accurate those figures are unless you’re a number-cruncher on the inside - in this case at Disney or Marvel. And sometimes damage control and image perception will impact the budgets that are reported. Damage control and image perception? In Hollywood? Who knew!
In the case of Captain America: Brave New World, which as of this writing has been out for four weekends and earned $371 million worldwide (according toBox Office Mojo), there was definitely damage control to do. Amid increasingdoom-and-gloom reportssurrounding the MCU overall, there’s also the apparentlytroubled production historyof the film to consider, which was said to include difficult test screenings, expensive reshoots, and even the addition of a new villain character (Giancarlo Esposito’s Sidewinder) to the plot.
The Brave New World budget that has beenreported by trade outletslike Variety and The Hollywood Reporter is$180 million, but that seems low considering the reported (at least)22 days of reshoots, and indeed, some well-sourced industry observers indicate that the final budget was significantly higher. According toThe Hot Mic, the budget was in the range of $300 million, while Joanna Robinson and Dave Gonzalez, who wrote the bookMCU: The Reign of Marvel Studios,have said their sourcespeg the movie as costing closer to $380 million. Bear in mind there’s also the matter of P&A (prints and advertising) costs, which would be in the tens of millions at the very least if not higher for an MCU blockbuster (Variety pegs P&A for Brave New World at$100 million). And then there’s the revenue split that the studio has to share with theater owners!
So take the $300 million figure as an example. If that was the total cost for Marvel, then the common wisdom in Hollywood bookkeeping is that the film would need to make $600 million before the studio has even broken even. That clearly will not happen in theaters as the film is slowing down substantially and nearing the end of its theatrical run.
Here’s how Captain America: Brave New World currently ranks at the box office as compared to the highest- and lowest-grossing MCU movies.
Highest Grossing Movies:
Lowest-Grossing Movies:
Now all this said, things get much hazier when it comes to the value of having, say, Captain America: Brave New World always available as one of the titles on your streaming service. Or when you can keep selling merchandise based on these characters. Or when you’re setting them up for their next big Avengers movie, which is likely to make way more money than Brave New World has.
This is Hollywood magic, folks, only not the good kind. As underwhelming as the bulk of the post-Endgame MCU has been, there’s a safety net component to being part of a shared universe. It’s also why budgets vs. box office comparisons are both unknowable and not the real issue. While an MCU movie can tank, it still serves the purpose of keeping the series moving and hence is easier to excuse in the grand scheme of things. A standalone movie with no franchise ties, however, has to stand on its own two feet. This is why things are that much harder for the Mickey 17s of the world these days.
Is releasing a stinker like Brave New World the cost of doing business for a shared universe mega-franchise these days? You gotta keep the factory line running, as Lucille Ball learned all those years ago. And if that means every now and then stuffing your face full of chocolate that you don’t really even want, at least you know it comes out in the wash in the end."
"Streamer Valkyrae’s cameo alongside other famous content creators was cut fromA Minecraft Movie, it was confirmed over the weekend. Addressing the situation, Valkyrae, real name Rachell Marie Hofstetter, told fans she would “much rather not have that 30 seconds than be sued.”

Last year, Valkyrae namechecked A Minecraft Movie star Jason Momoa when asked for her “worst celebrity or streamer experience.”
In avideo interview, Valkyrae alleged: “I just saw him mistreat some of the crew. And it was pretty disappointing. It was after a very intense scene, and it was a very emotional scene, so maybe he was still in character. I don't know. But I just was surprised at how he treated some of the crew.
“He was just really mad at them that they weren’t doing something right. It was setting up the shot and stuff, and he was angry, like really mad, and like yelling. So I was like, man, this is not a good work environment. I would not be happy working under these conditions.
“I would have to say that was the worst celebrity thing I’ve seen.”
Fast forward to the weekend just gone andA Minecraft Movie’s record-breaking release, and Valkyrae’s cameo appears to have not made the cut, although some fans believe they have spotted a blink-and-you’ll miss glimpse at the streamer in the background of a certain shot.
In alivestream on Twitch, Valkyrae touched on the situation around A Minecraft Movie. She kept her cards close to her chest, dancing around the reason for her omission, but did confirm her cameo was meant to be 30 seconds long, and insisted its removal had nothing to do with Minecraft or the people behind it.
“Let’s just say I’m not gonna touch too much on it,” Valkyrae began. “But as much as you guys saw the other creators that were in it, would have been the equal amounts that you saw me in it, which is like 30 seconds. So it’s okay.
""I would much rather not have that 30 seconds than be sued. So it’s all good, okay? It’s all good.
“It really was a wonderful 10 days in New Zealand for that 30 seconds, and I’m really glad I got to visit New Zealand.
“I feel like things could have been so much worse, you know what I mean? That’s all I’m going to say about it, okay. That’s all I’m going to say.
“It’s not even Minecraft. It’s not even their fault. Don’t even worry. Don’t worry.”
IGN has asked Warner Bros. Discovery for comment.
The upshot of all this is Valkyrae is not in A Minecraft Movie, which you’d imagine would have soured her on the film itself. Not so. “No, the movie did not suck,” she said on stream. “I thought it was good. I actually thought it was good.”
We’ve got plenty more on A Minecraft Movie, includinghow rowdy fans are creating wild scenes in the cinema, causing some to say it’s ruining their experience.
IGN’sA Minecraft Movie reviewreturned a 6/10. We said: “Napoleon Dynamite director Jared Hess puts a surprisingly specific and funny comic spin on A Minecraft Movie’s kid-friendly adventure, especially in its less antic first half.”

"Tim Burton may not have directed a Batman movie in over 30 years, but his DC Universe is still going strong. Michael Keaton got the chance to reprise the Bruce Wayne role in 2023’s The Flash, a movie that (briefly) ported his Batman over to the DCEU. But even now, the Burton-Verse continues to expand through new comic book and novel spinoffs likethe recently announced Batman: Revolution.

It’s gotten to the point where the question of how to watch and read the entire Burton-Verse is a surprisingly complicated one. But don’t worry, we’re here to help. Read on for a full breakdown of how the various Tim Burton Batman movies, novels, and comics fit together.
You can also check out our full guide towatching all the Batman movies in order.
Counting the yet-to-be-released Batman: Revolution, there are currently seven projects set in Burton’s Batman universe - three films, two novels, and two comics. That lineup includes 1989’s Batman, 1992’s Batman Returns, and 2023’s The Flash, as well as the books Batman: Resurrection and Batman: Revolution and the comics Batman ‘89 and Batman ‘89: Echoes.
This lineup also excludes 1995’s Batman Forever and 1997’s Batman & Robin, which are no longer considered to be part of Burton’s Batman universe. We’ll get into the reasons why a bit later.
Although you can stream Burton’s Batman movies on Max and read the Batman ‘89 comics on DC Universe Infinite, it never hurts to go the physical media route these days. If you’re looking to buy the Burton-Verse movies and books, here are some good options:
*Each blurb contains a broad overview of the plot and mentions the heroes/villains who appear in that film or book.
This is the original movie that started it all. Burton’s first Batman movie pits Michael Keaton’s Dark Knight (still early in his superhero career) against Jack Nicholson’s Joker. The movie inspired a summer of “Bat-Mania” and proved there was a healthy appetite for darker, more mature superhero movies in Hollywood.
This novel by John Jackson Miller is set in the aftermath of the first movie, as Batman deals with the remnants of the Joker Gang and confronts the rise of the shape-shifting villain known as Clayface. The book is designed to bridge the gap between Batman and Batman Returns, including introducing Christopher Walken’s character Max Shreck and giving readers more insight into the collapse of Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale’s (Kim Basinger) romance.
Miller is returning for a second novel set between the events of Batman and Batman Returns. This time, Revolution will introduce the Burton-Verse’s version of Riddler, a lowly newspaper copy editor named Norman Pinkus who laments the fact that no one appreciates his aptitude for solving crimes. Pinkus will turn to a life of crime and capitalize on the city’s growing resentment toward the wealthy elite of Gotham.
Burton and Keaton both returned for this film sequel, which is set a few years after the events of the first movie. This time, Batman goes up against Michelle Pfeiffer’s Catwoman and Danny DeVito’s Penguin as Gotham City endures a hellish holiday season. Despite initial plans for a third Batman movie, both Burton and Keaton ultimately dropped out of what became 1995’s Batman Forever.
DC’s Batman ‘89 comic serves as a direct sequel to Batman Returns and is set three years later. The six-issue comic, written by Batman screenwriter Sam Hamm and illustrated by Joe Quinones, draws inspiration from Burton’s abandoned plans for a third Batman movie. The book sees Billy Dee Williams’ Harvey Dent become Two-Face, while also introducing a version of Robin modeled after Marlon Wayans (who at one point was attached to play the role in Batman Returns). Michelle Pfeiffer’s Catwoman also makes a return appearance, paying off on the tease from the end of Batman Returns.
Click here to learn more about how Batman ‘89 adds to the Burton-Verse.
Just as Batman ‘89 is essentially Burton’s Batman 3 in comic form, Hamm and Quinones reunited for a follow-up that acts as a hypothetical fourth Burton movie. Three years after the events of Batman ‘89, Keaton’s Bruce Wayne has gone missing, leaving Robin and the new Batgirl to deal with the threat posed by Scarecrow (modeled after Jeff Goldblum) and Harley Quinn (modeled after Madonna).
While only hardcore Burton-Verse completionists need to worry about this one, it's worth mentioning that Robert Wuhl briefly reprises the role of intrepid reporter Alexander Knox in the first chapter of The CW's Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover. That episode briefly shifts focus to Earth-89, where Knox is seen reading a newspaper in a park as red skies form over Gotham. It's one ofnumerous live-action DC cameos in the crossover.
While it didn’t fare well critically or commercially, The Flash at least has the distinction of giving Bat-fans some closure on the saga of Keaton’s Batman. Keaton himself returns to play a much older Bruce Wayne, after Ezra Miller’s Barry Allen mucks about with the DCEU timeline and inadvertently trades one Batman for another. Meeting The Flash and learning about the threat of Michael Shannon’s General Zod is enough to coax Batman out of retirement for one last, high-stakes mission.
1995’s Batman Forever and 1997’s Batman & Robin were once considered sequels to Batman and Batman Returns, despite the fact that neither Burton nor Keaton returned for these projects. The presence of supporting characters like Pat Hingle’s Commissioner Gordon and Michael Gough’s Alfred maintained some degree of continuity with the previous films. However, these two sequels are generally regarded as being inferior to their predecessors, as well as being far different tonally.
With the release of The Flash, DC now officially treats Batman Forever and Batman & Robin as being set in a separate version of the DC Universe. The Batman ‘89 comics now act as the definitive, canon sequels to Batman Returns, revealing what happened to Keaton’s Bruce Wayne between the events of Returns and The Flash.
Warning:this section contains spoilers for The Flash!
The Flash wasn’t always intended to be the end of the road for Keaton’s Batman. At one point, the character was being positioned for an ongoing role in the DCEU (before WB cut that cinematic universe’s future short). Reportedly,a previous version of the movieended not with Batman dying in battle against Zod in the Flashpoint timeline, but with both Keaton’s Bruce and Sasha Calle’s Supergirl crossing over into the restored DCEU. That’s where WB’s canceled Batgirl movie comes in.
Keaton wound up reprising the role again in Batgirl, which reportedly cast him as an aged, Batman Beyond-esque mentor to Leslie Grace’s rookie Barbara Gordon. J.K. Simmons also returned as the DCEU Commissioner Gordon, while Brendan Fraser played the villain Firefly.
The Batgirl movie made it well into post-production beforeWB infamously pulled the plug and canceled it as a tax writeoff. It became a major casualty in the studio’s evolving plans for the DC line and the pivot toJames Gunn and Peter Safran’s DCU. Barring any major leaks, Keaton fans will never have an opportunity to see what will likely be his final Batman performance.

"One Piece as a franchise has been getting a lot of extra attention lately. There's thelive-action versionof the show on Netflix, some highly anticipatedLEGO One Piece sets, and even a recentcollaboration with the NBA. Whether you're new to the series or have been around since the very beginning, there's never been a better time to be all-in on One Piece, especially with new episodes arriving next week as the animereturns from its six-month hiatus.

While the series seemingly has an endless amount of episodes – more than 1,000 to be more precise – One Piece has no shortage of movies either. The latest film in the franchise, One Piece: Red, was released back in 2022, but Amazon has only recently dropped the price of the 4K steelbook to a reasonable price. You can also find the same deal at the Crunchyroll store right now.
Since this steelbook was first available on Amazon, it has notdropped below $29.79as its lowest ever price. The discount that is happening now is largely thanks to theCrunchyroll storeoffering a price reduction alongside theCrunchyroll Anime Awardsthat are starting in April. If you're hoping to add this steelbook to your One Piece collection, right now is the best time to do so.
One Piece Film: Red is the most recent movie in the series and probably not the best place for a newcomer to jump right in. There are are actually a total of 15 One Piece movies in the franchise and they all fit in various points in the timeline. This particular movie takes place after episode 1030 on theOne Piece timeline, so you have a long ways to go if you're just starting on The Romance Dawn Arc. If you're ready to start the ultimate anime marathon, One Piece is available on pretty much everyanime streaming site, includingCrunchyroll.
IGN reviewed the latest One Piece movie when it first came out. We like it enough to give it a 9 out of 10 in our review. Here's a quick breakdown of what we thought of the film:
""One Piece Film: Red breaks the mold of the typical anime shonen film, capturing the magic of the series. It’s confidently a musical, too, with J-Pop star Ado providing several fantastic earworms as Uta Shanks doesn’t get as much screen time as fans may hope, but it’s still satisfying to spend more time with him. It’s not the movie that will convert non-believers into fans – it feels more like a lost episode than a cash grab for newcomers – but by heavily integrating itself with the main series and understanding the humor that makes it shine, Film: Red ranks at the top of One Piece’s features.""
If you want to stream this movie online rather than purchase a physical version, there are currently two main places you can watch it online with a subscription. The first ison Netflix, which has pretty much all of One Piece available to stream. The second option is a Premium Crunchyroll subscription, which does offer a free trial for new subscribers."
"Having launched in 2019, Apple TV+ is one of the youngest streaming services available today. Over the years, the Apple-owned platform has grown into a powerhouse of original TV shows, likeTed LassoandSeverance, as well as movies likeKillers of the Flower Moon. While it may not release new content at the same pace as something like Netflix, Apple TV+ is only a fraction of the price and comes bundled with just about every new Apple device purchase, making it easier than ever to check out its growing library. Below, we'll break down what Apple TV+ is as a service, how much it costs, and how to sign up for a free trial.

Apple TV+ offers a 7-day free trial for all new subscribers. Simply head over to theApple TV+ homepageor app and you'll be greeted with a button that says ""Accept Free Trial."" NewiPhones,iPads, Apple TVs, and Mac computers also come bundled with a 3-month Apple TV+ trial, which requires manual activation through the Apple TV app on the device. In both cases, once your trial ends, your subscription will automatically renew at the standard monthly rate of $9.99/month.
Apple TV+ is an award-winning streaming service featuring Apple Originals — exclusive series, movies, documentaries, and more, with new content added every month. While it was a bit barebones when it launched in 2019, Apple TV+ has grown its library to over 180 series, with breakout hits like Ted Lasso, Severance, and Silo, as well as over 80 original films, including Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. Apple TV+ was also thefirst streaming service to receive an Academy Award for its original film CODA, which released in 2022.
While Apple TV+ may not boast a massive library like Netflix, it's long maintained a ""quality over quantity"" approach when it comes to its original programming with something that will surely appeal to just about anyone, regardless of age.
Apple TV+ is one of the least-expensive streaming services at $9.99/month.Since there's no ads by default, there's no ad-supported or limited tiers to worry about.
Aside from standalone subscriptions, Apple TV+ is included in a bundled service calledApple One. The lowest-tier Apple One plan gives you access to four subscriptions: Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and a 50GB iCloud+ plan, all for $19.95/month. The Premier Apple One plan costs $37.95/month, adding Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, and an upgrade to 2TB of iCloud+ storage.
If you're a current college or university student, you can sign up for aApple Music plan that includes Apple TV+at a discounted rate of $5.99/month. Apple Music usually costs $10.99/month on its own, so this is quite the deal.
Treated as a separate subscription, Apple TV also hosts Major League Soccer streams. TheMLS Season Passstarts at $14.99/month, and Apple TV+ subscribers get a $2 discount.
Apple TV+ is available to stream on all of your Apple devices including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV set-top boxes. Additionally, you can stream Apple TV+ on a variety of internet-connected smart TVs, Roku devices, Amazon Fire TV devices, Google TV devices, as well as PlayStation and Xbox consoles. You can also AirPlay from an Apple device to any compatible AirPlay device that doesn't feature the native Apple TV+ app.

"Amazon sales are some of the best ways to get cheap 4K TVs, butSpring Deal Dayshas kicked it up a notch for£200 off this 48"" OLED LG evo C3, making it only £599.

Among the various brands offering OLED TVs these days, LG's have usually been ranked among the very best. When you take a look at some of its features, it's not too hard to understand why.
Presented in an ultra-slim design that's great for minimalist spaces, the evo C3 brings LG's array of impressive OLED TV technologies to your entertainment and gaming. For instance, the Gen6 a9 AI processor makes this unit an absolute powerhouse for 4K displays and crystal-clear immersive sound.
This isn't just great for the latest TV shows & movies like Severance and Mickey 17, but gaming too. The OLED LG evo 3's 0.1ms response time and added AMD features mean you'll be able to play games likeAssassin's Creed ShadowsandFortnite, both beautifully and with minimal input lag. Among the mid-range TVs you can get right now, this is a solid choice at an even better price point thanks to Amazon's 25% price drop.
If £599 still feels like too much just for the TV in your set-up and you aren't too bothered about OLED, the Amazon Big Spring Sale has also got an incredible Hisense bundle on offer. You canget the 55"" QLED Hisense 55E7NQTUK Pro with the HS3100 Soundbar & subwoofer at £312.89 offfor only £476.10.
The only drawback you'll be getting is that QLED isn't as ideal for darker rooms, with OLEDs providing a more cinematic, immersive experience depending on what you're watching. Still, if all that really matters to you is just having a decent 4K TV in general without extra bells and whistles— with a nice soundbar to back it up— the Hisense bundle will offer you a lot more for your money at a smaller price tag."
"Sony is working on a new Starship Troopers movie reboot, according to various Hollywood sources.

The Hollywood Reportersaid District 9, Elysium, and Chappie director Neill Blomkamp has signed on to write and direct a new adaptation of Starship Troopers, the 1959 military sci-fi novel by Robert A. Heinlein.DeadlineandVarietybacked up the report.
This new Starship Troopers movie is not a continuation of or related to Paul Verhoeven’s cult classic 1997 sci-fi satireStarship Troopers. Rather it is a new adaptation of Heinlein’s novel, and comes from Sony’s Columbia Pictures.
News of Blomkamp’s involvement with this new Starship Troopers movie feels puzzling givenSony itself recently announced a live-action movie of blockbuster PlayStation Studios shooter Helldivers. Arrowhead's Helldivers is heavily inspired by Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers, and sees cannon fodder soldiers tasked with defending a satirized fascist Super Earth regime from alien bugs, among other enemy factions, while preaching Liberty and Managed Democracy to the masses.
Sony now faces the prospect of having new Starship Troopers and Helldivers movies going up against each other, although The Hollywood Reporter said Blomkamp’s take is not a remake of the Verhoeven movie, rather a return to the source material. Heinlein’s book that Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers is based on differs strongly in tone from the film, with many believing it promotes the ideals the film satirizes.
Neither this new Starship Troopers nor the Helldivers movie has a release window, so it may be some time before we see or hear from either project. Blomkamp’s last film was Sony’s own Gran Turismo, an adaptation of the long-running PlayStation-exclusive driving simulation series.

"A Minecraft Moviehas enjoyed a record-breaking start at the box office, leapfroggingThe Super Mario Bros. Movieto secure the biggest domestic debut in history for a video game adaptation.

The Xbox game adaptation starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, the latter of whom also starred in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, smashed box office expectations with an enormous $157 million at North American theaters. The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which for now remains the highest-grossing video game adaptation of all time,enjoyed $146 million domestically during its opening weekend in April 2023.
A Minecraft Movie added $144 million via the international box office for a global opening weekend total of $301 million. A Minecraft Movie reportedly cost $150 million to produce before global marketing costs, so it may already be profitable for Warner Bros.
A Minecraft Movie is of course based on Mojang'sMinecraft, the best-selling video game of all time. The Microsoft-owned sandbox remains one of the most popular video games in the world, and has movie tie-in DLC to capitalize on the film’s launch.
IGN’sA Minecraft Movie reviewreturned a 6/10. We said: “Napoleon Dynamite director Jared Hess puts a surprisingly specific and funny comic spin on A Minecraft Movie’s kid-friendly adventure, especially in its less antic first half.”

"If you were to stitch all of the greatest hits of the gangster genre into a single movie, you could do a whole lot worse than Barry Levinson’s The Alto Knights. Written by Nicholas Pileggi (who adapted his own nonfiction books intoGoodfellasandCasino) Levinson’s, the latest movie from the director ofBugsydepends entirely on its central gimmick: screen mobster extraordinaire Robert De Niro in the dual role of warring crime bosses. It tends to talk in circles, doesn’t offer much to get emotionally invested in, and rides an awkward line between caricature and traditional drama, but it has just enough visual energy to remain interesting.

The Alto Knights stars De Niro as Frank Costello, a respected mafioso on the edges of legitimacy. It also stars De Niro as Costello’s lifelong friend Vito Genovese, a much seedier gangster who returns to New York after years away and tries to reclaim his throne. Following a failed attempt on his life – a hit he quickly figures out was ordered by Genovese – Costello opts not for the traditional, muscular mob response, but instead takes it as a sign to leave his life of crime. But as we know from decades of movies and TV, you don’t leave the mob until the mob leaves you.
An older Costello narrates most of the onscreen action, which makes for both a minor strength and a major crutch. The wistfulness and air of mischief with which he looks back on the grimy glory days makes Levinson’s story feel alive, but The Alto Knights also heavily depends on exposition to fill in some major gaps. It’s a film that’s largely told, with little by way of actually showing. That is, until it’s time to show how often its characters speak in dull repetition. That’s all in spite of abundant photo-and-film-reel montages that are meant to explain Costello and Genovese’s shared history in Manhattan’s Little Italy, but reveal little more than the time they spent together at the infamous mob hangout The Alto Knights Social Club. Little about their dynamic is ever illuminated, no matter where and when we meet them.
This lack of specificity goes hand in hand with The Alto Knights’ inability to determine whether it’s a straightforward biopic or a self-aware commentary on gangster movies as a whole. Levinson splits the difference: On one hand, De Niro delivers a mostly naturalistic performance as Costello, which matches the registers of co-stars like Debra Messing, Kathrine Narducci, and Robert Uricola. On the other hand, De Niro gets bigger and broader with Genovese, hunching over and pitching up his voice. It’s hard not to see the performance as an impression of (or a tribute to) De Niro’sRaging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino, andThe Irishmanco-star Joe Pesci. Costello, meanwhile, is colored in shades from the mobsters in De Niro’s past, be they the fictitious Vito Corleone inThe Godfather Part IIor the very real Al Capone inThe Untouchables. It’s why you go with De Niro for a role like this: As far back asAnalyze This, he’s been molding new characters around archetypes he himself helped build.
This more cartoonish approach ultimately bleeds into the looks of the characters, and their behavior, too. For all its stabs at realism in dialogue and performances, The Alto Knights bears a visual resemblance to Warren Beatty’s live-action-comic-strip version ofDick Tracy. The prosthetic nose De Niro wears as Costello protrudes like that of a Halloween-costume witch; playing Genovese, he’s given a jaw so square, it almost makes his head seem too big for his body. (From some angles, he looks like a Funko Pop.) Cosmo Jarvis, who plays the would-be assassin Vincent Gigante, hobbles around with an enlarged barrel chest and a triple (sometimes quadruple) chin.
This all works best when Costello and Genovese share the screen; unfortunately, they don’t have many scenes together. In the rare De Niro-versus-De Niro moments, the actor fires on all cylinders. He creates glances of thought, doubt, and desire out of practically nothing, and turns tedious conversations into riveting negotiations. The most exciting sequence is one where Genovese and Costello share an emotional connection despite being separated by several states: The former watches (and responds out loud to) a televised congressional hearing at which the latter speaks.
This is the one time The Alto Knights approaches real depth and tension. Granted, this scene is just as dialogue-heavy as the rest of the film, but its words disguise and reveal self-doubt in equal measure, rather than simply stating the character’s thoughts and feelings out loud. The colorful ensemble does its best to breathe life into the movie, but ultimately, it struggles to entice and endear, listing through endless scenes with no direction. With De Niro at the helm of Levinson’s mob-movie curiosities, you’re at least guaranteed a seasoned hand and a novel combination of desires and impulses courtesy of one of Hollywood’s greatest talents. That’s worth something, even if The Alto Knights as a whole fails to do anything new with the familiar trappings of gangsters, molls, betrayals, and assassinations.
Barry Levinson’s mob movie The Alto Knights falls somewhere between caricature and straightforward drama. It can’t decide whether it wants to tell the real-life story of respected mob boss Frank Costello and his comrade-turned-scheming-enemy Vito Genovese, or if it wants to skewer the entire genre of films they helped inspire. However, with Robert De Niro in both leading roles, there’s always something interesting to watch, even if it’s buried by mountains of repetitive dialogue."

"Big news for Now You See Me fans: not only isNow You See Me 3officially titled Now You See Me: Now You Don’t, but Now You See Me 4 is in the works.

The announcement was made on-stage during CinemaCon by Adam Fogelson, chair of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group, who also confirmed that Now You See Me 3’s previously announced release date of November 14, 2025 remains on-track.
Director Ruben Fleischer has signed a deal with Lionsgate to develop and direct a fourth installment of the action-heist franchise, which has made $700 million at the global box office so far.
The first two films starred Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, and Morgan Freeman, among others, with Justice Smith, Dominic Sessa, and Ariana Greenblatt joining as a new generation of illusionists and Rosamund Pike also starring in the franchise’s third installment, Now You See Me: Now You Don’t.
Now You See Me: Now You Don’t reunites Fleischer with Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson, who were also the stars of Fleischer’s debut film Zombieland. His most recent film is Uncharted, which took in over $400 million worldwide, and he directed Venom, which grossed over $850 million globally.
Bobby Cohen, who originally developed and has produced all the films in the series, will return to produce the new installment alongside Alex Kurtzman of Secret Hideout. Meredith Wieck will oversee the project for Lionsgate.
Fogelson commented: “Ruben has delivered all of the twists and turns and sleight-of-hand that audiences expect from this franchise while upping the stakes and scale in every way. We can’t wait for audiences to discover what he’s done with the third film and thrilled he’ll be making even more magic with us.”
Fleischer added: “Directing Now You See Me: Now You Don’t was as much fun as making any movie in my career. It combines two of my favorite things — heist movies and magic — and working with this incredible cast was truly magical. Of course I want to keep it going.”
IGN’s Now You See Me reviewgave it 6.3/10 and said: “Now You See Me seemed so promising, but it squanders its cool cast and nifty premise on smarmy, shallow characters and a flimsy, nonsensical plot.”
IGN'sNow You See Me 2 reviewreturned a 6.2. We said: ""Now You See Me 2 isn't the worst magic act in town, but it's all flash and no substance.""

"Amazon is hosting aBig Spring Salethis week (March 25-31), with deals on selectbooks,Blu-rays, toys, and more. Sure, some toys are meant for kids, but when it comes toNerf guns, LEGO (like theLEGO Wednesday Set) and beloved character plushies, I think anyone can enjoy these cozy collectibles.

I've rounded up the best deals I could find across popular franchises and characters, includingPokémon, TMNT, Disney, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and beyond. Whether you're buying for yourself or want to gift to a loved one, these cute plushies are affordable, adorable, and worth checking out.
One of the most popular plushie types sold these days is reversible plushies, giving you two sides of a character. It's essentially a two-in-one collectible, allowing you to switch up the expression you want to display based on your own mood on any given day. The TeeTurtle brand is one of the most common brands offering reviersible plushies, which is found above from Avatar: The Last Airbender, TMNT, and the Axolotl stuffed animals.
A personal favorite of mine is theInside Out 2 Embarrassed Character plush. I love the Inside Out movies and characters, and I appreciate the fact the plush is weighted for extra comfort and anxiety relief. Plus, it's only $14.40. In fact, most of these picks are below $15 with the exception of Kirby and Grogu!
TheSquishmallows Storeis loaded with fan-favorites right now on Amazon. There are select 10-inch Harry Potter plushies on sale, a cute lava lamp plush, a huggable Iron Man plush, and more squishy pals you can collect below during the Big Spring Sale.
AsPokémon toysremain popular, it's rare to see big Pokémon plushie deals on the most popular characters. That said, depending on the size and type you're seeking to find, there actually are some on sale this week, so don't miss out!
While Amazon is one of the more convenient places to shop, it isn't the only place where you canbuy popular plushies. Two of the best alternatives to Amazon are Target and Walmart, which will often have inventory when Amazon runs out. These two retailers also usually have more 20-inch versions in stock as well. For Pokémon fans specifically, you can also findPokémon SquishmallowsfromPokemon Center.

"LEGO has been rolling out newLEGO Lord of the Rings setsat a leisurely, hobbit-like pace of late. In 2023 we got a stunningRivendell set. Last year, LEGO released a huge set of the Sauron’s iconic Dark Tower, akaBarad-dûr. And now, finally available for anyone to buy (exclusively at theLEGO Store), is a lovely, peaceful set based on The Shire – specifically, the hillside residence of Bilbo and Frodo in Bag-End.

The Shire is a bucolic build based on a peaceful, down-to-earth setting. In fact, the house depicted in the set is carved right into the earth of a hillside. It’s comprised of three rooms that are filled with all sorts of details and Easter eggs from the stories. It also comes with Gandalf’s cart, the tent that gets blasted into the air by a dragon firework (also included), as well as the stage on which Bilbo disappears during his eleventy-first birthday celebration.
The set comes with nine minifigures:
The main complaint I’ve seen about this set is the price – and it’s a fair complaint, to be sure. This set costs 34% more than it “should” based on the traditional math of LEGO sets costing roughly 10 cents per brick. Surely there’s an IP tax for the Lord of the Rings branding, but even still it’s a lot. If it’s out of your range, that’s fair enough. It will likely be discounted at some point down the line, probably after it loses its LEGO Store exclusivity and comes to other retailers like Amazon or Target.
However, it’s still a very coolLEGO set for adultsthat would be a great addition for any fans of the Lord of the Rings books, movies, or any other medium they’ve landed in over the years.
Be sure to check out ourWe Build LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Shirefeature for full details on what it’s like to build the set. And if you're interested in seeing more new stuff, check out thebest new LEGO sets for April 2025.

"If you’re a Minecraft die-hard, you might have seen one particularly sneaky Easter egg in the new film adaptationA Minecraft Movie— but all is not what it seems. According to Mojang Studios Senior Creative Director of Entertainment and producer on A Minecraft Movie, Torfi Frans Olafsson, that moment that seemed to be alluding to the 2010 Creepypasta storyHerobrineisn't an Easter egg, but a mistake the visual effects team ran out of time to fix.

Warning!Spoilers for A Minecraft Movie follow:
For context, A Minecraft Movie has a scene that takes place at the Woodland Mansion where Henry (Sebastian Hansen) meets an Enderman who puts him in a state where he’s able to see a vision of Steve (Jack Black), except the character is verbally berating him as his eyes go white. Because Herobrine is characterized as Steve with white eyes, fans were convinced that the moment signified that there was a future for the Creepypasta story within the MCU (Minecraft Cinematic Universe, duh).
However, Olafsson has cast doubt on this assumption. ""It’s super strange that all of their eyes were supposed to be purple but when it was rendered one of the characters eyes kept coming out white in the final rendered frames so we wound up keeping it like that, because the VFX studio ran out of time,"" he revealed onX / Twitter.
In the early Minecraft days, an anonymous poster on 4chan claimed they saw an in-game version of Steve with white eyes and weird powers showing up around the game. Following the post,a Creepypasta storysurfaced, which “revealed” that the character anomaly was actually the spirit of a dead player.
Olafsson's comment is being taken by many fans as a knowing wink to this being a genuine Herobrine Easter egg in A Minecraft Movie. After all, the joke is that it's an unfixable error, that Herobrine appears and can't be removed.
We’ve got plenty more on A Minecraft Movie, includinghow rowdy fans are creating wild scenes in the cinema, causing some to say it’s ruining their experience.
IGN’sA Minecraft Movie reviewreturned a 6/10. We said: “Napoleon Dynamite director Jared Hess puts a surprisingly specific and funny comic spin on A Minecraft Movie’s kid-friendly adventure, especially in its less antic first half.”

"That Christopher Nolan! What an unpredictable guy he is, with his “movies told out of order” games, “is it a dream or reality” stories, “what timeframe are we witnessing things happen in” trickery, and his “screw it, let’s just run time backwards” hijinks.

All of which is to say, for someone with such a notably wacky outside-the-box storytelling track record, it’s a bit surprising that Nolan’s next movie is seemingly a straight-up adaptation of Homer’s epic poemThe Odyssey.
Sure, we don’t really know all that much about the film yet.Matt Damon is playing Odysseus, who is of course the main character of Homer’s story, and an extensive group of noteworthy actors have been cast in as-yet unannounced roles in the film, including Tom Holland, Zendaya, Jon Bernthal, Lupita Nyong'o, Anne Hathaway, Robert Pattinson, and Charlize Theron, among others. The Odyssey is shooting now and has a release date of July 17, 2026, with Universal Pictures calling the film “a mythic action epic shot across the world using brand new IMAX film technology.”
Matt Damon is Odysseus. A film by Christopher Nolan,#TheOdysseyMovieis in theaters July 17, 2026.pic.twitter.com/7a5YbfqVfG
Real quick for those who skipped it in high school, The Odyssey tells the 10-year story of Odysseus’ attempt to get home to the Greek island of Ithaca after the events of the Trojan War, an effort that is made all the more difficult when he angers the god of the sea, Poseidon. And this after already being stuck at Troy for 10 years! Waiting for him at home are his now adult son Telemachus and his ever-faithful wife Penelope, although things have grown increasingly dicey for both of them as a group of “suitors” vie for Penelope’s hand in marriage. As he fights to get home, Odysseus encounters all manner of mythological creatures and challenges.
It’s freaking great, and one of my favorite books. But it’s also proven challenging to properly adapt to the screen. There have been a bunch of attempts over the years, dating back at least as far as the 1911 Italian silent film L'Odissea, but often the scope of Odysseus’ story has been truncated or mismanaged in translation to movie or TV form. However, Nolan, fresh off the financial and critical success of the Oscar-winning Oppenheimer, is perfectly placed to finally get Homer’s story right on the big screen.
But again, what exactly is the director drawn to in this story? He’s often got sci-fi or sci-fi adjacent concepts in his films, and while Odysseus certainly exists in the realm of the fantastical, that’s not quite the same vibe. (A cyclops is not sci-fi, sorry!) Still, I think there’s a good chance that Nolan’s real obsession… no, not dead wives, hisotherobsession… could be why he’s making this movie, and also why he’sperfectfor this movie: It’s his interest in playing with time, or how the viewer perceives time in relation to the story being told, that is perhaps the key to nailing The Odyssey.
One of the reasons why The Odyssey has always been a challenge to properly adapt to movies and TV (aside from the obstacle of convincing visual effects until relatively recently) is the nature of the main character’s story. While his time away in the Trojan War isn’t technically part of The Odyssey (that’s The Iliad, for those who also skippedthatclass), those first 10 years away from his family are a necessary bit of backstory that infuses The Odyssey with a lot of its emotion. Add to that the 10 years that it takes Odysseus to finally get back home andthenthe actual re-taking of that home when he battles the suitors (this last part was its own movie alone just last year –The Returnstarring Ralph Fiennes), and you’ve got a lot of story taking place over a very long period of time.
I’ve always thought that biopics always run the danger of being the CliffsNotes version of a person’s life, which is why when a movie like James Mangold’s A Complete Unknown focuses in on just a few years of a historical figure like Bob Dylan’s life, it can be a much more effective way of telling a story. Equally, trying to do The Odyssey in, what, three hours? It’s a tall, tall order.
But here comes old Chris Nolan withhis timey-wimeyand, let’s be fair, highly creative ways of dipping in and out of a story, using the very nature of time as a tool rather than an obstacle. Look at Interstellar, where Matthew McConaughey’s Cooper takes off into outer space for what is basically a one-way mission where time gets all kinds of weird for him and his crewmates, even while his children grow to adulthood back on Earth and, eventually, mourn their apparently lost father. There are certainly Odyssey parallels right there in terms of the missing father on a lost voyage, whose family faces disaster back home, but it’s the way that Nolan tells the story, despite the challenges of, well, time, that is so affecting. He’s not deterred by the vast gulf between the father and his children, but instead uses it to his advantage.
Odyseuss fights a giant Cyclops, sees a bunch of his men turned into pigs, and confronts a bunch of other crazy shit in his story, but he also faces time as an enemy, and in a variety of ways. Not only is he literally 20 years away from his family by the end of his journey, but seven of those years see him trapped on the island of the nymph Calypso, who loves him and offers him immortality (another aspect of time or the perception of it) if he’ll stay with her. He and his crew's visit to the realm of the Lotus-Eaters plays with time in a different way, in that those who eat the fruit of the land lose any interest in returning home, content to stay and eat the fruit forever. And then there’s our hero’s trip to the Underworld, where he finds lost friends and family, including his mother and his comrade Achilles, who are doomed to exist, if not quite live, for eternity as mere shades of their former selves.
Then there’s the situation back home, as Telemachus was just a baby when his father left and is now a young man. Odysseus’ father Laertes is a sad shell of his former self, having lost his wife to grief over the past 20 years, while assuming his son is gone forever too. And in one of the most effective passages in Homer’s poem, even Odyseuss’ dog Argos has been waiting for him all this time!
Will Nolan be able to tell Odyseuss’ full story effectively by utilizing his particular brand of stylized filmmaking? The guy is fixated on time, and by extension memory, and that certainly seems to be a quality he shares with the hero of The Odyssey as well, a man who eventually has nothingbutmemories – of his family and the life he once lived – to rely on as he fights the great gulf of time to get home."
"The Legend of Zelda live-action movieis in active development at Nintendo and Sony Pictures fora March 2027 release. It’s early days yet for the hotly anticipated feature film adaptation of the blockbuster video game franchise – which, after years of rumors, wasofficially announced in November 2023– so here’s what we know for sure about the movie so far.

The film is being produced by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Avi Arad, chairman of Arad Productions and former founder and CEO of Marvel Studios. Sony Pictures Entertainment will handle theatrical distribution in addition to co-financing the movie with Nintendo. Jurassic World’s Derek Connolly is writing the screenplay.
Wes Ball, who made the Maze Runner movies and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, is directing Zelda. As if he was fated to land the job,Ball actually tweeted about wanting to make a Zelda movie way back in 2010.
At that time, Ball said he envisioned his Zelda as being another mo-cap endeavor like James Cameron’s Avatar. More recently, the filmmaker said he wants his Legend of Zelda to be “this awesome fantasy-adventure movie that isn’t like Lord of the Rings, it’s its own thing. I've always said, I would love to see a live-action Miyazaki. That wonder and whimsy that he brings to things, I would love to see something like that.""
In a later interview, Ball backed off of his 2010 notion of making it a mo-cap movie. In May 2024, Ball said makingan all mo-cap Zelda movie “probably isn't his choice”since he was just coming off of the CG-heavy KIngdom of the Planet of the Apes. Ball’s aim is to make Legend of Zelda feel ""grounded"" and ""real."" He added, “We're working hard, and we're gonna make something great.""
Ball has also said: ""I want to fulfil people's greatest desires. I know it's important, this [Zelda] franchise, to people, and I want it to be a serious movie. A real movie that can give people an escape. … [The film has] ""to feel like something real. Something serious and cool but fun and whimsical.""
A die hard Zelda fan who said he grew up on the franchise, Ball unintentionally stirred up other fans whenhe refused to tell IGN last year what his favorite Zelda game was.
No one has been cast yet but The Sixth Sense’sHaley Joel Osment expressed his desire to land a role in the Zelda moviewhen he appeared onIGN Arcade. Euphoria’sHunter Schafer has expressed interest in playing Princess Zelda.
Euphoria star Hunter Schafer is a fan of the Nintendo series, saying, “I love the game, personally. I played it as a kid and I still play it now. Who knows! That would be pretty cool.”pic.twitter.com/lDNB1BkEqJ
Fan reaction when the movie was officially announcedback in November 2023 was swift and opinionated. Some took umbrage at Avi Arad – the former boss of Marvel Studios who also produced Ghost in the Shell and the early Spider-Man movies – being involved (“Can't believe they were able to get the producer of the hit film Morbius!!”). Others weren’t thrilled by the selection of Wes Ball to direct.
The decision to make the Legend of Zelda a live-action movie was met with trepidation: “People can say Zelda plot doesn't work in live action but action films have hardly ever relied on deep, complex plots to engage people.” “Animated would have been the way to go if you ask me.”
IGN editors also expressed their thoughts aboutwhy Zelda should be an animated movie instead of live-action. “And while hand-drawn art may be the best fit for a Zelda movie in my opinion, there are plenty of animation styles that would serve as a better vehicle for Zelda than live-action,” IGN’s Logan Plant wrote at the time the movie was announced.
“Think about all the gorgeous animated projects we’ve seen in the last several years: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Dragon Quest: Your Story, the Castlevania anime, or even a claymation look come to mind as visual styles that would perfectly suit the wonderful world of Hyrule. I can visualize what all these versions of Hyrule would look like, but I can’t say the same thing about live-action.”
“There are so many oddities in Zelda that come across as charming when animated, but could easily be seen as off-putting when done in live-action. This is a franchise where a literal enormous pig is the main villain, after all. But Zelda is also full of surprising horrors, from zombies that wrap their entire bodies around Link to try and kill him, to disembodied giant hands that swoop down from the ceiling. I have a hard time seeing a lot of Zelda enemies make it into a live-action movie without seriously frightening the little ones.”
IGN’s Matt Kim also opined at the time thatit would be “a trap” if Nintendo and Ball tried to adapt Breath of the Wildfor the silver screen: “If you’re going to make a Zelda movie, I’d adapt one of the games where the story is a bit more center-stage, whether it’s the pirate adventures of Wind Waker, the classic sword and sorcery of A Link to the Past, or arguably the most cinematic Zelda game of all-time, Twilight Princess.”
“Game devs have marveled at the power of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom’s engineering, calling the way its systems interact with each other near-magic. It’s not just showing audiences Link’s cool abilities but playing within an entire world, with its own laws of nature that just simply cannot be conveyed by looking at a screen alone. While there are plenty of fun moments a Breath of the Wild movie could include as fun easter eggs — like Link discovering he gets a stat bonus when he cooks during the blood moon for example — the game’s sense of discovery can never truly be captured on camera. … Breath of the Wild turns players into theoretical physicists, experimenting with how the interlocking rules of the game play off one another – which, unless the director plans on making a movie similar to Oppenheimer, would make for not a lousy Zelda movie.”
For their part, the filmmakers acknowledge the risk inherent in making a live-action Zelda movie. ""Regarding the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda,I know we face an extremely high hurdlein producing a film that will not disappoint the global fan base,"" Shigeru Miyamoto told Nintendo investors during a Q&A in November 2023. Miyamoto added that he had been developing the Zelda movie with Arad for ten years prior to the official announcement.
Sony Pictures will release The Legend of Zelda in theaters on March 26, 2027. In order to make that date, fans should expect filming to commence in 2026 or maybe even late this year to allow for enough post-production time to pull of the film’s visual effects.
There isn’t one as nothing has been filmed yet. However, IGN pranked the Internet on April Fool’s Day 2008 when we releaseda faux live-action Zelda movie trailer(which can be viewed below). Until there’s a real movie trailer to watch, ours will have to do:
Who do you think should play Link, Zelda and other key characters in the upcoming movie? Let us know in the comments."
"Look, we get it. You're busy. Things are happening onlineconstantly. You can't stay up to date on everything, all of the time. And that even means that you occassionally will miss a trailer or preview for an upcoming movie.

But worry not, because we've got a round-up of some of the biggest trailers of the past week that you can watch right here. From a return to the John Wick universe in Ballerina to the next film from Paul Thomas Anderson to Happy Freakin' Gilmore 2, scroll on to check them all out...
Adam Sandler finally returns forHappy Gilmore 2on July 25 on Netflix. That's only 31 years after the original comedy classic! The first film's Julie Bowen, Ben Stiller, and yes, even Shooter McGavin himself, Christopher McDonald, also return.
This is just a 20-second teaser but it's for the next film from Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, etc.).One Battle After Anotherstars Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro, Sean Penn, and Regina Hall, and promises to be Anderson's biggest production yet. Here's the elevator pitch from Warner Bros.: ""When their evil enemy resurfaces after 16 years, a group of ex-revolutionaries reunites to rescue one of their own's daughter."" The film will hit theaters, including IMAX, on September 26.
John Wick may be dead -- long live John Wick! -- but that doesn't mean his universe doesn't continue on. Case in point, Ballerina (AKA the awkwardly named From the World of John Wick: Ballerina), which actually even has the Keanu Reeves character cameoing in it (since the film is a mid-quel set between John Wick 3 and John Wick 4).

"Drop opens in theaters Friday, April 11. This review is based on a screening at the 2025 SXSW Film and TV Festival.

Usually, the most harrowing thing that might happen if you fail to modify your AirDrop settings is a bunch of teenagers sending you random dick pics – a scenario that’s tweaked in the new Christopher Landon-directed techno-thriller Drop. Landon, who also madeHappy Death DayandFreaky, loves a gimmick. And “What if phone, but scary?” sure seems like one. Fortunately, Drop is more interested in thrilling the audience than winking at us, and is a more entertaining film as a result.
Drop makes harassment-by-Bluetooth scary by pivoting away from the prankster angle early on. At first, Violet (Meghann Fahy) is annoyed when someone starts sending her random memes as she waits for her date to arrive at a swanky restaurant on the 38th floor of a Chicago skyscraper. Then the messages start getting more personalized, and Violet realizes that whoever is targeting her – she’s not sure who, but it has to be someone within 50 feet, given their weapon of choice – is watching her, setting a locked-room mystery plot into motion.
The obvious question here is, “Why doesn't she just switch off her phone and leave?” And that’s where the kid in peril comes in. Violet is a single mother, widowed in an incident that’s teased in the movie’s cold open but whose traumatizing details aren’t revealed until the very end. Violet has spent most of the five years since holed up at home with her son, Toby (Jacob Robinson), who was a baby when his dad died and is now a precocious kid with glasses and intense separation anxiety. When she pushes back, Violet’s mystery contact starts threatening Toby, and Drop isjustmean enough that we can’t be certain that the little guy will make it out of this alive.
Violet isn’t handling her first time away from Toby since his infancy very well either, compounding her jitters about meeting Henry (Brandon Sklenar), the handsome photographer she’s been messaging on a dating app for the past three months. Henry is patient and understanding, and genuinely interested in building a relationship; without revealing too much, it’s very unlikely that he’s the one provoking Violet. And in a movie landscape choked with well-meaning but hacky takedowns of monstrous men hiding behind friendly façades, it’s kind of refreshing to have a movie where the nice guy is actually, well, nice.
Drop’s tight structure and compounding twists are reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan, with the major difference being that Shyamalan would never get as snarky as Landon does in the first act. Search Party’s Jeffery Self carries much of the comedic burden as an oversharing, eager-to-please waiter, who loses patience with Violet’s increasingly bizarre requests but has to keep smiling and accommodating her. (This is a very expensive restaurant.) There are some sick giggles to be had later on, one of them an R-rated Spielberg bit involving Toby, a loaded handgun, and a remote controlled car. But for the most part, Drop abandons the wisecracks once the stakes reach life-or-death heights.
Not every part of this more earnest approach works: Even when it’s not a-joke-a-minute, a Christopher Landon movie is probably not the place to be exploring themes of domestic abuse. But the fundamentals of action, tension, and escalating suspense are strong, and Landon makes great use of the claustrophobic central location and its vertigo-inducing heights. This unpretentious thrill ride is a fun diversion, and a surprisingly good date movie – providing your date isn’t too triggered by a lounge-piano rendition of “Baby Shark.” Parenthood is difficult, y’all.
Drop is a tightly plotted and unpretentious thrill ride. By concentrating on suspense (with only a light sprinkling of snark), Happy Death Day and Freaky director Christopher Landon successfully pulls off the techno-paranoiac premise of a night on the town disrupted by a series of escalating, Bluetooth-enabled threats. The result is a locked-room mystery that’s also a surprisingly good date movie."
"The Boysstar Jack Quaid has said he’d love to appear in a BioShock movie, saying the much-loved first-person shooter is one of his favorite games of all time.

Speaking in aReddit AMAtimed to coincide with the launch of his new movie, Novocaine, QuaidsaidBioShock has “such a rich lore” that could be explored in a TV or movie adaptation.
""I would actually love to be in a live action adaptation of Bioshock - one of my favorite games of all time,"" he said. ""I think there's such a rich lore to that game that could be explored in a TV or movie adaptation.""
But what are the chances the Bioshock movie actually gets made? In July last year, producer Roy Lee said that, following leadership changes,the video-game-to-movie BioShock adaptation had been “reconfigured,” resulting in a “more personal” film.
Lee said some of the changes came from lower budgets from Netflix. Details about the BioShock movie’s plot have not been revealed, so it’s unclear what it would have looked like before the shift. Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence is stillattached to direct.
“The new regime has lowered the budgets,” Lee said at the time. “So we’re doing a much smaller version. It’s going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”
Quaid’s comments on BioShock come alongside an admission that he looks a lot like video game action star Max Payne, whose likeness is based on Remedy writer Sam Lake. Indeed, there are shots from Quaid’s new action movieNovocainethat have caused fans to wonder if it’s a Max Payne movie in disguise.
Live action Max Payne. Seems so real so worth it. This is Max Payne. You got me watching this now. Even the woman looks like the woman from Max Payne 2 lol. The resemblance is almost as if NovoCaine characters (basically is) by the same actor (Jack Quad looking like Sam Lake)pic.twitter.com/kawh2C1B2n
Alas, it seems Quaid is less familiar with Max Payne, which is currently getting the remake treatment from Remedy in a deal with original publisher and rights holder Rockstar.
“I've seen people say that I look like Max Payne, and when I've looked at the box art, even I did a double-take,"" Quaid continued. ""I love Rockstar's games, but unfortunately I've never played that one - it's next on the list, for sure.”
Apart from Bioshock, Quaid loves FromSoftware games. In the same Reddit AMA, Quaid said he loved the challenge presented by the likes of Bloodborne and Elden Ring.
“I'm a huge video game nerd,”he said. “And lately I've been diving headfirst into the FromSoftware library. I beat Bloodborne, then I beat Sekiro, and now I'm going full boar into Elden Ring. Actually, the thing I use Reddit the most for is tips and tricks on beating Fromsoft's bosses. I love how challenging the games are - it took me a while to get into them, but now I'm obsessed.”

"Netflix has released the debut trailer forHappy Gilmore 2, which hits the streamer on July 25, 2025.

In the trailer, below, we see Adam Sandler return to the Happy Gilmore role almost 30 years after the original movie’s 1996 release, alongside original Happy Gilmore stars Julie Bowen, Ben Stiller, and Christopher McDonald, the latter of whom once again plays nemesis shooter McGavin.
We also see new co-stars Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio (aka Bad Bunny), daughters Sadie and Sunny Sandler, and Blake Clark. There’s even a fun SpongeBob SquarePants reference at the start of the trailer.
Netflix confirmedthe professional golfers set to appear in the film, including John Daly, Paige Spiranac, Rory McIlroy, Scottie Scheffler, Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas, and Will Zalatoris. NFL star Travis Kelce also cameos.
Eminem isn’t on Netflix’s current cast list,despite Sandler revealing the rapper's cameo late last year. Perhaps the streamer is saving his reveal for the next trailer.
Here’s Netflix’s official recap of the original Happy Gilmore, in case you’ve forgotten what happened all those years ago.
We first learned that Happy Gilmore 2 was in the worksback in March2024 beforeNetflix announced in Maythat it had officially ordered the sequel. It's being directed by Kyle Newacheck from a script by Sandler and Tim Herlihy.

"If you're looking for an OLED TV from a reputable brand name at a great price, then Best Buy has got a solid deal going on right now. The Sony Bravia XR A75L 4K OLED smart TVs are on sale right now with the 55"" model priced at $999.99 and the 65"" model for $1,299.99. These prices are lower than what we saw during Black Friday (the 65"" model was $1499 at the time). Although the A75L is an older generation (2023) TV, it's still one of the best TVs out there in terms of image quality and gaming performance. Especially for the 55"" model, you won't find a better TV for under $1,000.

Generally speaking, OLED TVs are considered the best TVs you can buy right now. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, they offer better image quality, deeper blacks, better contrast ratio, wider color gamut, and super fast response times. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV are easily the best type of TV for viewing 4K HDR content in all of its glory.
OLED technology aside, the A75L has  the features you'd want in a current generation gaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel as well as two HDMI 2.1 ports that can run games in 4K at up to 120fps on a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming console. The OLED panel benefits from a near instantaneous response time (sub 0,.03ms) and supports features like variable refresh rate (VRR) including G-SYNC and auto low latency mode (ALLM). Note that despite this being a Sony TV, it pairs equally well with an Xbox console.
Sony OLED TVs use Google TV as its smart interface. Google TV is intuitive to use and supports voice commands through Google Assistant. You can also pair it with an Android phone to use as a remote.
You don't have to wait for the new 2025 LG TVs to drop to score a great deal on an older generation model. Right now, you can pick up a 202365"" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TVfor just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday. The LG Evo C-series of TVs have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVs, especially for 4K HDR movies and gaming.

"I didn’t think we’d see a proper Pokémon TCG restock this early in 2025. Honestly, I was betting on summer at best, but here we are with actual product showing up on Amazon and not behind some sketchy paywalled Discord server. While the internet’s currently losing its mind over Prismatic Evolutions and burning money chasing stock alerts for Rival Destinies, the smart play is scooping up the older sets that just hit Amazon Global. We’re talking Scarlet and Violet era stuff, Sword and Shield throwbacks, and boxes that were basically extinct six months ago.

This is the kind of flood the TCG community needed. Not just for collectors trying to complete sets, but for anyone who’s tired of battling bots for ETBs like it’s the Hunger Games. There’s a real mix available right now: Booster Bundles, Premium Collections, tins with actual storage value. And yes, even a few deals that make it feel like Amazon’s trying to keep the vibe positive. If you’re chasing big pulls like Greninja SIR or Pikachu ex SIR, or just need to stock up on sleeves and dice, this is the best stock refreshes we’ve seen in a while.
AliExpress is currently offering theSony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphonesfor only $225.18 after coupon code:IFP7FJZis applied during checkout. This product is stocked in a US warehouse, so it ships free and arrives within about a week. This is an import model with a warranty that won't be honored in the United States. AliExpress makes up for it with a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days.
In our glowingSony WH1000XM5 review, Kevin Lee wrote that ""The Sony WH-1000XM5 is hands down the best sounding and most impressive noise-canceling headphones around. They demand a high premium but the cost of audio excellence is well worth it with this pair of headphones.""
The real deal here is the fact that theTwilight MasqueradeElite Trainer Box is actually in stock. Seeing it available without a 200% markup or sketchy third-party seller feels borderline miraculous. You’re getting nine booster packs, a full-art Teal Mask Ogerpon promo, and all the usual ETB goodies like energy cards, condition markers, and themed sleeves.
It’s not every day you seeBrilliant StarsBuild and Battle Boxes in stock, let alone without having to navigate the wild west of resale sites. At $63.34, this one comes with four booster packs and a pre-release promo card, which makes it a solid pickup for collectors looking to flesh out their Sword and Shield era sets. Arceus VSTAR headlines the expansion, and the pull potential here still holds up.
Among Us 4-Pack on Steam is a sneaky little deal that gives you four copies of the game for the price of one, making it dangerously easy to rope your friends into a night of trust issues and vent-related betrayal. It supports cross-platform play, customizable settings, and chaotic emergency meetings that usually end with the wrong person getting ejected. If you’ve somehow missed the social deduction chaos, now’s the perfect time to catch up and take three crewmates down with you.
TheHisuian Electrode V Boxis back in stock at Amazon for $42.45, which is a win considering how sporadically these pop up. It's one of those V boxes that slipped under the radar when it first launched, but now that Sword and Shield-era product is drying up it’s worth grabbing. You get a foil Hisuian Electrode V promo, a regular Electrode foil, an oversized version (because why not), and four booster packs to rip through.
This limited-edition snack box is a flavor-packed tribute toAssassin’s Creed Shadows, blending premium Japanese treats with collectible game merch in a way that feels like an edible side quest. You get 15 unique snacks, a full bag of exclusive Kit Kats, a custom Tenugui towel, and even an in-game item called The Hourglass that’s only available through this box. With artwork prints, a detailed snack guide, and a box sleeve that transforms into a display-worthy poster, it’s more than just snacks.
Seeing theShining FatesPikachu V Box on Amazon again feels like spotting a shiny in the wild. At $49.96 it’s not exactly a steal, but having it in stock is the real value. This box comes with a foil Pikachu V promo, an oversized version for flair, and four Shining Fates booster packs. That means a legit shot at pulls from one of the most hype-filled sets of the Sword and Shield era.
TheSurging SparksBooster Bundle is actually in stock at Amazon for $47.95, which is kind of a miracle considering how fast this set’s been disappearing. You get six booster packs from the newest Scarlet and Violet expansion, which includes some major chase cards like Pikachu ex SIR and Latias ex. If you missed the chaos of launch day or couldn’t snag a bundle without battling bots, this is your chance to catch up.
I want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.
This phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.
I can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.
RimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.
This SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.
I never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.
I think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.

A genuine Apple leather case for $11.99? That’s not a typo. It’s an 80% discount.

It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.
If you’re tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.
Why buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.
If you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.
Still using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.
These aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.
These Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.
Luxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.
This isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.
For those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says ""powerful Pokémon"" like an angry robot penguin).
I'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.
If somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.
Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).
If you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, ""I really need to delete some games,"" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.
Samsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype.

"You don't have to wait for the new 2025 LG TVs to drop to score a great deal on an older generation model. Right now, you can pick up a 202365"" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TVfor just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday. The LG Evo C-series of TVs have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVs, especially for 4K HDR movies and gaming.

The LG Evo C3 is a 2023 model, just one year behind the 2024 LG Evo C4. So what are the differences? Aside from the $650 price difference, not much. The most important trait -- picture quality -- is more or less identical. Where the C4 improves on the C3 are an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate.
OLED TVs are considered the best TVs you can buy right now. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, they offer better image quality, deeper blacks, better contrast ratio, wider color gamut, and super fast response times. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV are easily the best type of TV for viewing 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations.
The LG C3 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel and all four HDMI 2.1 ports for running 4K at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. It also supports variable refresh rate (VRR), auto low latency mode (ALLM), and DTS audio, which is good for people who still watch Blu-ray discs. The C3 is also much easier to set up than its predecessors; the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that drops the weight to a mere 36 pounds.
The LG Evo C-series TV is ourfavorite high-end 4K TV of 2025because of the brilliance of its OLED display along with a host of quality features that don't quite push it to the point of an excessively high price. This model brings better contrast and clarity than the previous year's already luminous LG C2. It’s a sight to behold, especially when you add in the deep blacks and well-balanced colors on the crisp 4K screen. Once you choose OLED, it's hard to go back to anything else.
The LG Evo C5 hasn't yet been released, butit was showcased during CES 2025. At least on paper, the improvements of the C5 seem to be incremental, with no major ground breaking updates that would make you want to hold off until its launch. More importantly, the C5 will probably release at a very high retail price which will take months to get down to a level that's competitive with other TV deals.

"Snow White was Disney’s miracle. The 1937 adaptation of the 19th-century Grimm fairy tale became the first animated feature film in America and reigned as thehighest-grossing animated filmfor the next 55 years. Much of the Disney we know and grew up with started with Snow White and the Evil Queen, so it's unsurprising that's where Disney looked for its next live-action remake.

Bringing the fairy tale to life is Rachel Zegler, a musical veteran and star ofSteven Spielberg's West Side Story remake, while Wonder Woman herself, Gal Gadot, takes the role of Evil Queen. IGN'sSnow White reviewdescribes the movie as ""the best Disney live-action remake in a decade (not that that’s a particularly high bar to clear),"" that adapts the ""broad strokes of the 1937 original, while fleshing out its themes of kindness.""
Whether you're a diehard Disney fan, looking for a movie to take the family to, or are just curious aboutall the controversies, here’s everything you need to know to watch Snow White.
Snow White just released in theaters. You can check for showtimes near you at the main theater links below:
It should come as no surprise that Disney’s Snow White will eventually stream on Disney+ instead of Netflix.Disney+ subscriptionsstart at $9.99, though one of thebest streaming dealsright now includesfour months of Disney+ and Hulufor $2.99/month.
In terms of a potential release date,Mufasacomes to Disney+ on March 26, just under three months after it released in theaters, whileMoana 2arrived on the streaming service in just over three months. Assuming the new live action Disney movie follows a similar release schedule,Snow White should be streaming on Disney+ by the end of June.
The original Snow White movie was inspired by the 1812 Brothers’ Grimm story of the same name, which you can read onlinehere. The new live-action Snow White adapts the animated movie, though with some elements “reimagined” for modern audiences. Here’s the new movie’s synopsis:
A princess joins forces with seven dwarfs to liberate her kingdom from her cruel stepmother the Evil Queen.
Theoriginal Snow White and the Seven Dwarfsis streaming on Disney+. It’s also available to rent or buy from most digital platforms, and has received several physical releases over the years.
The Snow White remake is directed byMarc Webb(The Amazing Spider-Man, 500 Days of Summer) and includes new origial songs written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, aka Pasek and Paul (La La Land, The Greatest Showman, Dear Evan Hansen). It stars the following:
The new Snow White movie is Rated PG for violence, some peril, thematic elements and brief rude humor. This is definitely one for the families. The movie runs for a total of one hour and 49 minutes."
"David Fincher and Brad Pitt are reportedly re-teaming to revive aOnce Upon a Time in Hollywoodsequel script written by original director Quentin Tarantino.

Details on what could eventually be a groundbreaking entry in Tarantino’s resume come fromThe Playlist, which says the Se7en duo is propping up the unexpected film to come to Netflix, continuing Fincher’s long-lasting relationship with the streaming giant. Should everything proceed according to plan, the currently untitled Once Upon a Time in Hollywood sequel would see Pitt return as stunt-double star Cliff Booth.
How such a script came into Fincher’s possession is its own wild story. The Tarantino screenplay is said to be an evolved version of a story previously known asThe Movie Critic, a project previously lined up to be the Pulp Fiction mastermind’s final filmbefore it was suddenly shelved last year. Tarantino was seemingly uninterested in letting the idea fade to black and is getting Fincher to bring it to life.
The Playlist’s sources say Netflix paid $20 million to acquire the screenplay with an expected $200 million budget and plans to shoot in California in July – just three months from now. No additional casting details have been confirmed just yet, but Leonardo DiCaprio is not expected to return as Rick Dalton. Fincher and Pitt are putting aside all other projects to focus on this new Once Upon a Time in Hollywood sequel.
Deadlinelater corroborated The Playlist's findings that a Once Upon a Time in Hollywood sequel is in development. Its sources say Pitt received Tarantino's blessing to present the script to Fincher, resulting in the wildly surprising project that is now in the works.
Once Upon a Time in Hollywood premiered in 2019 and is largely viewed as yet another outstanding entry in the Tarantino pantheon. That said, what could eventually be known as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood 2 has a lot to live up to. The original project came with an unambiguous ending that tied up its story with a brutal bow. However, much of its world has been explored elsewhere.
In 2021,Tarantino released a novelizationcovering the movie’s events while expanding upon its take on a 1960s California. It broughta few interesting revelations about Cliff Booth’s pastto the conversation, including an answer to whether or not the dog lover really did kill his wife as teased in the movie. It’s a book that will no doubt carry more meaning when the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood sequel finally sees the light of day, though it’s unclear just how important to the story it will be.

"Novocaine is in theaters on March 14, 2025.

Edgar Wright made a name for himself with action comedies like Shaun of the Dead and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World – movies where normal, flawed dudes reluctantly kick ass and get the girl. But it’s been a while since we had a great one of those, so the space was open for directors Dan Berk and Robert Olson – best known for indie films likeSignificant Otherand Villains – to take their own stab at that concept with Novocaine, a gnarly action-comedy romp about a guy with a rare genetic disorder who risks it all to save his one-night stand. Despite its shallow gimmick, Novocaine delivers a sharp script and a fresh take on the hapless hero, as brought to life by the irresistible Jack Quaid of The Boys fame.
Right off the bat, it’s apparent that Nathan Caine (Quaid) isn’t your typical schlubby hero-by-accident. He’s got a great sleep schedule, he drinks green smoothies for breakfast, and, well, he looks like the progeny of Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan. But growing up withCIPA– an often-fatal condition that makes it impossible for Nathan to feel pain or even temperature – has made for a very sheltered life of trying not to accidentally die. It’s a lonely existence, so after his work crush, Sherry (Amber Midthunder), coaxes Nathan out of his shell and into bed, it’s no wonder that he’s willing to put it all on the line to save her from a trio of kidnappers the very next day. After all, he’s on an all-liquid diet for fear of biting off his own tongue, and this is the woman who fed him hisfirst-everbite of pie.
Nathan might be oblivious to physical harm but he otherwise could not be less suited for hand-to-hand combat, and that contrast is delicious. As he stumbles into vigilante justice he strives – with all the decorum his assistant bank manager job requires – to outrun police detectives, career criminals, and his own mortality. It’s hard not to root for someone who’s down so bad he’ll stick his hand in a deep fryer; someone who pukes in distress after his first kill. It’s not every day you get to see a guy who reeks of having an up-to-date LinkedIn profile learn to fire a stolen gun.
Nathan’s written with care, humor, and specificity – hallmarks of Lars Jacobson’s clever script. There are some guys who are just plain bad, but most characters resist the straightforward morality typical of most action movies. Sherry is an excellent example of that complexity. Though she may be the impetus for Nathan’s spree, she’s no damsel; Nathan, who has recklessly forsaken his Bubble Boy-esque existence for a John Wick-style quest, is clearly the one in distress.
The premise is silly and the bloodshed is plentiful, but Novocaine is far from unfeeling. Perhaps its greatest asset is its earnestness. Our wet cat of a protagonist isn’t the only one who risks life and limb for human connection, and while the kidnappers are mostly just sociopathic thugs, one character turns out to be a great foil for Nathan with a very different relationship to pain. By the end, it’s apparent that Novocaine isn’t just about some guy who can’t feel physical pain. This is a story about the emotional agony of vulnerability, and the depths we will go to to share our lives – and our feelings – with other people. It’s set during the Christmas season, but the fact that Novocaine is premiering almost exactly five years after we all went into isolation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic feels somehow more appropriate.
We’ve all seen plenty of movies with fish-out-of-water heroes who groan or flail their way through fights. These can lean too far into cynicism, offering so much self-awareness that there is little room to surprise or delight. (For a recent example, see the horror-romanceLove Hurts.) Novocaine, by contrast, effectively sells this well-trod cliche thanks in large part to Quaid, whose character feels grounded despite his wildly unusual circumstances. Quaid brings Nathan to vivid, glorious life, adding a sort of gawky ferality that is a real joy to watch. Humanizing details from the script – like the fact that Nathan’s online handle is MagicNateBall – pair perfectly with Quaid’s impenetrable charm.
That’s not to say that the script never crosses the line between clever and cutesy. (His last name shares a syllable with the word “novocaine” – we get it!) But this is a consummate popcorn movie, and it’s invigorating to see a fun, well-made,originalfilm in a cinematic landscape that increasingly feels overtaken by shared-universe sequels and dour dramas. Novocaine goes down easy – or as easily as any movie with gory compound fractures and fingernail removal can.
Novocaine offers more depth than its gimmicky “man who feels no pain” premise may lead you to believe. This movie breathes new life into old ideas, with an original hero buoyed by the charm of Jack Quaid and a heroine who ably beats the damsel-in-distress allegations. Novocaine is smart, but not so self-aware that it’s likely to alienate anybody; sharp, but not without feeling. This isn’t a game-changer, but it signals a much-needed return to originality for popcorn action movies. Here’s to more of this sort of clever storytelling and character writing that reminds us of a time when seeing movies in theaters was just plain fun."
"Marvel has announced the cast ofAvengers: Doomsdayvia a lengthy livestream that confirmed a further 26 actors set to appear in the superhero movie as well as the start of production. Among the surprises, Channing Tatum will reprise his role as X-Men fan-favorite Gambit.

The video revealed the MCU actor names, displayed on the back of a series of chairs, alongside their character's musical themes. In a nice touch, Ant-Man star Paul Rudd's chair was tiny, and Patrick Stewart's chair was revealed alongside the iconic X-Men '90s animated series music. Robert Downey Jr., who famously played Iron Man in the MCU and is now down to play Doctor Doom, appeared at the end to sit in his chair before turning to the camera and putting his finger to his mouth to make a ""shhh.""
Names shown included Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Vanessa Kirby (Invisible Woman), Pedro Pascal (Mister Fantastic), Joseph Quinn (Human Torch), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Thing), Letitia Wright (Shuri / Black Panther), Winston Duke (M'Baku), Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Tenoch Huerta Mejía (Namor), Simu Liu (Shang-Chi), Anthony Mackie (Captain America), Danny Ramirez (Joaquin Torres / Falcon), Sebastian Stan (Winter Solder), Wyatt Russell (John Walker / U.S. Agent), Florence Pugh (Yelena Belova), Lewis Pullman (Robert Reynolds / Sentry), David Harbour (Red Guardian), and Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost).
Meanwhile, Fox X-Men veterans Kelsey Grammer, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, and James Marsden are all now set to appear in Avengers: Doomsday, confirming the X-Men are in the film in a big way. Grammer famously played Beast in the Fox X-Men franchise beforemaking his MCU debut via The Marvels' post-credits scene. Stewart played Charles Xavier/Professor X in the X-Men films before appearing briefly in the MCU via Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness as a member of the Illuminati. McKellen, who played Magneto, has yet to appear in the MCU. Neither has Cumming, who played Nightcrawler, Romijn, who played Mystique, nor Marsden, who played Cyclops. It begs the question:is Avengers: Doomsday secretly an Avengers vs. X-Men movie?
One of the biggest surprises is the addition of Channing Tatum to the cast. Tatum played fan-favorite X-Men character Gambit in last year's smash hitDeadpool & Wolverine, and is now confirmed to reprise his dream role in Avengers: Doomsday.
Late last year, MCU chief Kevin Feige teased the introduction of X-Men characters in the ""next few"" MCU movies. Feige told an audience at the Disney APAC Content Showcase in Singapore that fans would see “some X-Men players that you might recognize” in the next few MCU movies, but he stopped short of saying which characters or what movies.
On bringing the X-Men into the MCU, Feige added: “I think you will see that continues in our next few movies with some X-Men players that you might recognize.
“Right after that, the whole story of Secret Wars really leads us into a new age of mutants and of the X-Men. Again, [it’s] one of those dreams come true. We finally have the X-Men back.”
Feige has also said the X-Men will be an important part of the MCU’s future following Secret Wars. ""When we were preparing for Avengers: Endgame years ago, it was a question of getting to the grand finale of our narrative, and then we had to start all over again after that,” Feige said. “This time, on the road to Secret Wars, we already know very well what the story is going to be until then and afterwards. The X-Men are an important part of that future.”
Already confirmed to appear in Doomsday before today's announcement was the aforementionedRobert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom, withBenedict Cumberbatch set to return as Doctor Strange in Secret Wars. Scarlet Witch actress Elizabeth Olsen, meanwhile, had suggestedshe would not be in either Avengers: Secret Wars or Avengers: Doomsday. Given Olsen's name did not appear during the livestream, it looks like that is indeed the case.
The question now is, was this an exhaustive look at the cast of Avengers: Doomsday, or are there more actor announcements to come? Assuming itisexhaustive, big-name MCU characters set to miss out include Nick Fury, Hawkeye, Hulk, the Marvels (Captain Marvel, Monica Rambeau, Kamala Khan / Ms. Marvel), Daredevil, Spider-Man, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool, and Wolverine. Captain America star Chris Evans, who was once rumored to return in some form, wasn't on the list either.
Earlier this month, co-directorsthe Russo brothers said they see Avengers 5 and 6 as a “new beginning”that will lay the foundation for whatever comes next in Phase 7 of the MCU.
“The only thing I’ll say about the movie is this: we love villains who think they’re the heroes of their own stories,” Joe Russo said. “That’s when they become three-dimensional and they become more interesting. When you have an actor like Robert Downey, you have to create a three-dimensional, well shaped character for the audience. That’s where a lot of our focus is going.”
Avengers: Doomsday is currently set to arrive in theaters on May 1, 2026, and Secret Wars arrives about a year later in May 2027. Before then,Thunderbolts*comes out in May 2025, TV showIronheartis out in June, and Phase 6 kicks off withThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsin July.
In October, Marvel Studios added three untitled movie projects to its 2028 release schedule: February 18, 2028; May 5, 2028; and November 10, 2028. It seems increasingly likely one of these movies is X-Men.

"Daniel Day-Lewis has been hailed as one of the greatest actors in cinematic history. Indeed, he’s won three Academy Awards, which is exactly three more than fellow English actor Mr. Jason Statham. But has Daniel Day-Lewis ever choked a man with a handful of casino chips, K.O.’d a dude with a coin, killed a fella with a spoon, or punched a bloke in thefistwith his ownhead? Jason Statham did all these in thesame movie. There’s just no contest.

Statham has become one of the 21st century’s most dependable action superstars. That’s why it’s exciting that he’s got a new film out now,A Working Man. So to mark the occasion, here are our favourite moments from Jason Statham’s hard-hitting and hilarious career. Because let’s face it: Until they start giving out Oscars for walking through fire, water-skiing blindfolded, or successfully taking up piano at a late age, it’s the least we can do.
You ever get the feeling that Jason Statham’s catalogue of action heroes are all the kind of guy who could take down three blokes with his hands tied behind his back? Well, you should, because inHomefrontStatham annihilates three dudes while his hands are tied behind his back. What better way to kick things off than this?
If there’s one thing that stung aboutThe Beekeeper, it’s that he’s too sweet on some of the scam call centre employees – letting them scurry out of the building before he blows it up simply because they apologised. We don’t watch Jason Statham movies to see him let the villains live, damn it! Fortunately, Statham partially makes it up to us by trailing the call centre manager, strapping him to his truck, and sending the empty vehicle off the end of a bridge, dragging the screaming scumbag behind it. They say bumblebees aren’t particularly efficient flyers, but at least they fly better than a 1967 Ford F-100.
Let’s double back to the movie alluded to in the intro, which isWild Card– a film that criminally flopped at the box office despite being directed by the man who bestowed Con Air upon the world, boasting a bonus appearance from Stanley Tucci with hair, and honestly featuring some of the best fight scenes of Statham’s entire career. In the final showdown, Statham guts no less than five gun-toting goons – armed only with a spoon and a butter knife – and walks away without a scratch. Jason Statham: king of knifey spoony.
Paul W.S. Anderson’s long list of video game adaptations haven’t exactly won the man fistfuls of prestige but, if we’re being honest, he deserves at least a pat on the back for his slightly-camp 2008 killer car feature,Death Race, where he vividly demonstrated a Mad Max: Fury Road-level commitment to crashing giant death trucks an impressive seven-odd years before George Miller actually made that movie. Statham getting the better of the Juggernaut by conspiring with his bitter rival is easily the highlight of the film. The score remains: practical effects - one million, CGI - zero.
Of course, on the topic of taking down giant monsters, no list of Jason Statham’s most memorable movie moments would be remotely complete without the time the man literally murdered a megalodon with a metal spear inThe Meg.After slicing its guts open from teeth to tail, Statham surfs the giant shark as it leaps skyward, shoving a stick straight into its eyeball in the process. Toppling back into the water, the prehistoric beast is subsequently devoured by dozens of its more diminutive descendants. It doesn’t matter where the predator comes from: If it bleeds, you can kill it.
Sliding in at number seven is one of Statham’s most iconic action roles: Frank Martin,the Transporter. Of course, the 2002 original is basically 90 minutes of Hong Kong-quality fight scenes from prolific action director Corey Yuen, so how do you choose just one moment? The container fight? The axe fight? The bus fight? There area lotof fights. Well, the answer has to be the oil fight, where Frank greases himself up to literally slip through his enemies’ fingers before turning the tables on them with a set of bicycle pedals and a series of savage spinning heel kicks.
Speaking of heels, the villainous Deckard Shaw’s heel-face turn in the Fast and the Furious saga was controversial for a while, but ever since Fast 9 confirmed he never actually killed Han during Tokyo Drift, we can all enjoy his past exploits without feeling guilty. Naturally, one particular moment that’s hard to go past is the Hard Boiled-inspired airborne rescue of Dom and Elena’s infant son inThe Fate of the Furious. Jason Statham has enjoyed action aplenty in the Fast saga since his post-credits appearance in Fast & Furious 6, but this mix of gun-fu and jokes about poo is arguably his greatest highlight.
Earning his spot alongside the heaviest of Hollywood hardmen in Sylvester Stallone’sExpendablesfranchise, Jason Statham’s Lee Christmas has had plenty of time to shine throughout the series, from kicking fellow countryman Scott Adkins into an idling helicopter to firing a flare from the front of a flying boat for a littlefry-and-die. However, his most memorable moment is the brief but brutal basketball court beatdown he gives to his girlfriend’s abusive ex and every one of his useless mates. Christmas may only come around once a year, but when he does, he smashes the crap out of six dudes in about 16 seconds. He’s like Santa, only instead of a nice list he just has a knife list.
In an absolutely scene-stealing performance in what’s already an extremely funny film, Jason Statham fully flexes his comedy muscles in 2015’sSpyas Rick Ford: the unkillable secret agent extraordinaire who’s immune to 179 different types of poison and makes his own suits. Statham enjoys plenty of hilarious moments in Spy, but the best is when he regales Melissa McCarthy with tales of his legendary toughness: “I drove a car off a freeway, on top of a train, while I was on fire. Not the car. I was on fire.”
Come on. You didn’t think we were going to forget the infamousTransporter 2barrel roll, did you? Calm as a cucumber, Frank Martin flings his two-ton Audi upside down to dislodge the bomb strapped beneath it, all with the complete confidence of a man flicking a speck of soot from the shoulder of his suit. Tell your teachers: Physics are cancelled.
After surviving falling several thousand feet from a helicopter, Chev Chelios’ clearly superhuman heart has been stolen by Chinese gangsters. That is the plot ofCrank 2. As such, you shouldn’t be surprised when, at one stage, Chev hallucinates an entire fight at a power station as a souped-up, 100-foot-tall kaiju version of himself, complete with a mask of… his own head. This is a real movie that definitely happened.
What better choice for number one thanSnatch, where Jason Statham – in only his second film appearance after he debuted in Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels – didn’t just shine amongst Hollywood heavyweights like Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, and the late Dennis Farina – he came away with a whole host of the movie’s most-quotable lines. It’s tricky to pick a favourite quip from a movie chock full of them, but Turkish’s iconic response to Tommy’s desire to carry a gun seems like a safe bet (“What is a gun doing in your trousers?” “For protection.” “Protection from what? Zee Germans?”).A safer bet than anything Brick Top suggests, at least.

"The new Minecraft movie has looked interesting from the very virst trailer and, now that it's in theaters, is headed straight forbox office success in 2025. With Jack Black and Jason Momoa plopped into the world ofMinecraft, it's a video game movie that has the potential to be popular with a massive audience of both kids and adults. Minecraft is one of thebest-selling video games of all timethat has infiltrated pretty much every medium, so its jump to a feature film was all but a matter of time. In ourreview of A Minecraft Movie, we found it to be surprisingly funny despite its contraints.Audience reactionshave made it a theater-going experience for the ages.

If you're planning to watch A Minecraft Movie in theaters, I've gathered all of the details below. For those of you waiting for it to come out on streaming and digital, I've also gathered the latest info I could find about release dates for both.
A Minecraft Movie, with a wide release date of April 4, is now available in theaters everywhere. To find when and where you can watch the film near you, check the listings featured below for local showtimes.
We don't yet have a streaming release date for A Minecraft Movie, but we know thatit will land on Max when it does hit streamingbecause it'sa Warner Bros. project. There is no clear time period when we can expect the movie to make the jump to a streaming service since it depends on how the film does in the box office, but we can make an educated guess based on past Warner Bros. movies. Theatrical windows have shrunk in the last few years, some as short as 14 days before hitting VOD. For a movie with such crossover appeal like this one, we'd bet that it has a longer life in theaters and won't hit streaming for three to four months. That would place thepotential streaming release date sometime in June or July 2025.
A Minecraft Movie does not currently have a release date for when it will become available to rent or purchase digitally. However, alimited edition steelbook is available for preorder, though without a release date. I'd venture a guess that it will release sometime closer to the end of May 2025.
The marketing team has already pushedMinecraft Movie LEGO setsand aMcDonald's collaboration, and we'll likely see even more merchandise over the coming weeks.
If you haven't been keeping up with the latest trailers for A Minecraft Movie, here's a quick synopsis of the film directly from the Warner Bros. website:
""Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits – Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks) – find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Jack Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative… the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.""
A Minecraft Movie is directed by Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite, Nacho Libre) and stars:
A Minecraft Movie is rated PG for some violence, language, suggestive humor, and occassionally scary images. It has a total runtime of 1 hour and 41 minutes including credits. There is amid-credits and post-credits sceneyou'll want to stick around for as well."
"You’d think a five-hour long video of some chairs with names on them would be devoid of Marvel Cinematic Universe Easter eggs, but some fans believe there’s one hiding in the shadows.

To recap, this weekMarvel announced the cast of Avengers: Doomsday in a video that slowly revealed chairs with MCU actor names on them. The video confirmed an additional 26 actors set to appear in the superhero mash-up alongside Robert Downey Jr.’s Doctor Doom. It took nearly five and a half hours to do so.
Most have now moved on from the video todebating what the cast announcement means for Avengers: Doomsday itself, but some have stuck with it, analyzing the chairs and even the shadows to within an inch of their lives. And now, some believe they’ve found… something.
The appropriately-named redditor True_Confusion_295 said “I feel like a conspiracy theorist circling things in red” when they pointed out that a shadow cast by one of the chairs forms what looks like an X on top of an A. What does that mean? Avengers vs. X-Men, of course.
Marvel surprised many by announcing a number of returning stars from Fox’s X-Men films. Fox X-Men veterans Kelsey Grammer, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, and James Marsden are all now confirmed to appear in Avengers: Doomsday. Grammer famously played Beast in the Fox X-Men franchise beforemaking his MCU debut via The Marvels' post-credits scene. Stewart played Charles Xavier/Professor X in the X-Men films before appearing briefly in the MCU via Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness as a member of the Illuminati. McKellen, who played Magneto, has yet to appear in the MCU. Neither has Cumming, who played Nightcrawler, Romijn, who played Mystique, nor Marsden, who played Cyclops. Even Channing Tatum gets to play Gambit again after his star turn in Deadpool & Wolverine. It begs the question:is Avengers: Doomsday secretly an Avengers vs. X-Men movie?
Perhaps, when the movie is finally revealed, fans will return to this moment to declare the hotly anticipated superhero scrap was first teased in the shadow of a chair. Or not.
Letters in shadows isn’t the only conspiracy theory coming out of Marvel’s announcement video. At the end, Robert Downey Jr. does a slightly unnerving ‘shhh’ to the camera as he brings his finger up to his mouth. Why? Could it be a sort of ‘don’t tell anyone’ warning because production is about to begin? Could it be a tease for Avengers: Secret Wars? Could it bea nod to more casting announcements to come?
Or could it be a reference to Agatha in WandaVision? And, in turn, the unexpected appearance of Scarlet Witch,despite actress Elizabeth Olsen suggesting she's not?

"A Minecraft Movie immediately creates a sticky paradox for itself. Clearly hoping to follow in the footsteps of a project likeThe Lego Movie, this video-game adaptation wants to pay tribute to the open-world flexibility and creativity ofMinecraftwhile staying well within the framework of the game itself, which means including all of the expected blocky visual touchstones and including an obligatory number of cutesy gamer in-jokes. The surprise of the movie is how long it’s able to delay the latter material – long enough, it turns out, forNapoleon Dynamitedirector Jared Hess to get his foot in the door, expertly adapting his deadpan comic-strip style for a children’s fantasy.

Hess’ foray into big-time franchise filmmaking reunites him with Jack Black, the star of his 2006 slapstick adventure,Nacho Libre– and no one can accuse Black of half-assing his way through a paycheck job here. As Steve, a man who “yearned for the mines” as a child and discovers a portal into the magical Overworld as an adult, he throws off the shackles of workaday existence with such relish that his torrent of movie-opening narration feels enthusiastic, rather than blandly explanatory. The short of it: Bad-guy pigs covet the “orb” (like everything else in the Overworld, it’s block-shaped, not an actual orb) that Steve has discovered, so he sends his faithfulwolf-dog, Dennis, to hide it in the real world.
Hess really connects with his Dynamite roots – throwback fashions, drier-than-dry non sequitur – and setting in that real world, where he pauses Steve’s story to follow siblings Natalie (Emma Myers, fromWednesday) and Henry (Sebastian Hansen) as they relocate to a small town in Idaho. There, creative, school-age misfit Henry clicks with Garrett Garrison (Jason Momoa), a former gaming champion who now runs a retro pop-culture junk store on the verge of foreclosure. Natalie, meanwhile, meets Dawn (Danielle Brooks), a friendly real estate agent who moonlights as a kind of mobile zookeeper.
In a movie for grown-ups, this litany of quirk might seem a bit much: Natalie is a young woman of indeterminate age who gets a job running social media for a local potato-chip factory; Henry tinkers with his design for a working jetpack. For a kid picture, though, it’s sweetly silly, even distinctive; the kitschy tater-tots-and-alpacas ambience is pure Hess. Momoa in particular makes a surprisingly good fit for the filmmaker’s sensibility, playing a less bullying version of the blustery Napoleon Dynamite sensei Rex Kwon Do. In fact, the first 30 to 40 minutes of A Minecraft Movie have enough big laughs that it’s almost a disappointment when Henry, Garrett, Natalie, and Dawn stumble upon the orb and wind up accidentally sucked into the Overworld.
Eventually they meet up with Steve, who provides some standard gameplay tutelage in advance of their quest. The quest itself is conceptually muddy, confusingly and erratically presented as some combination of saving Steve’s beloved Dennis, protecting the orb, and eventually bringing the four displaced travelers home. The seams of the six-writer screenplay show frequently, like when characters make plans and then deviate from them without comment as if the actors are all working from different versions of the script. Based on the uninspired action sequences – digital hordes running and flying around in a manner better suited for an in-gameLord of the Ringsfan film – there aren't many big-budget fantasy epics in Hess' future. But A Minecraft Movie stays light on its feet nonetheless by continually pausing for slapstick silliness and cartoonish little sketches like an ongoing and delightfully pointless subplot involving Jennifer Coolidge and a resident of the Overworld.
Eventually, the more antic side of things takes over, and the various CG landscapes populated by blocky people and creatures start to feel repetitive. It’s like a slightly more polished version of someone’s playthrough video, only with a couple of big stars getting thrown around the screen. What A Minecraft Movie misses from Minecraft the game is its combination of minutiae and vastness; as much as the movie advertises its subject’s creative flexibility, it shortchanges any potential obsessiveness in favor of making the Overworld look a little more like something out of aMariogame. The parallelsto Black’s other video-game-movie gig– and aspirations to its popularity with the playground set – become especially clear when Steve chases the next “Peaches” by riffing out no fewer than three little songs. (On the other hand, it’s hard to resist Black bringing his goofball-rock-star shtick to Gen Alpha.) As with so many game-based movies, the mismatch between what each medium does best isn’t really reconciled by A Minecraft Movie. But turning the world’s best-selling video game into Jared Hess’s best feature in years is, admittedly, a pretty creative undertaking.
For a big-studio adaptation of a massively popular video-game, A Minecraft Movie lets a surprising amount of its director’s personality shine through. Napoleon Dynamite’s Jared Hess manages to fit some laugh-out-loud silliness into his Overworld saga before surrendering to the obligations of CG-driven fantasy adventure. Thematically, A Minecraft Movie offers a pat world-is-what-you-make-it lesson, but Jack Black and Jason Momoa in particular sell it with a lot of comic enthusiasm."

"The Rule of Jenny Pen begins streaming on Shudder Friday, March 28.

The grueling but entertaining psychological thriller The Rule of Jenny Pen introduces one of the strangest movie villains you’ll ever meet: Jenny Pen, a baby doll puppet with tiny plastic hands and a bulbous head. The puppet’s eyes are long gone, so any light in the room tends to shine through the open sockets, giving them a disconcertingly eerie glow; her M.O. is one of mental and physical torture, a battery of distressing taunts aimed at the vulnerable residents of a New Zealand nursing home. But this is noChild’s PlayorM3GANsituation. Jenny carries out the petulant whims of her owner, played by John Lithgow in a formidable portrayal whose bullying energy could only be matched and countered by similarly seasoned pros Geoffrey Rush and George Henare.
The Rule of Jenny Pen is adapted from a short story by Owen Marshall, a New Zealander who specializes in antagonists like Dave Crealy (Lithgow): people who are so intensely aggressive that they can easily manipulate the meek. In this particular story, Dave meets a worthy adversary: Stefan Mortensen (Rush), an imperious judge who arrives at the home after suffering a stroke, and makes it his mission to expose this monster who stalks the halls at night, ending each intrusion into his neighbors’ rooms with the unsettling inquiry “Who rules?” The problem is that in the daylight hours, Dave comes across as a sweetly addled eccentric, beloved by the staff. And Stefan? He is one prickly pear. Throughout the movie, Stefan struggles to get anyone to believe that Dave and Jenny are trouble, mainly because, as written and performed, Stefan is so rude to everyone, all of the time.
Stefan isn’t easy to root for. When we first meet him, he’s sitting at the front of his courtroom, blaming the parents of a sexual-assault victim for not taking better care of their child. Later, at the nursing home, he complains about having to share a room with Tony Garfield (Henare): a former rugby star, a hero to his fellow Maori and a New Zealand national treasure. It’s a credit to Rush that even though Stefan can be demanding and petty, he also comes across as heroic in his own way, standing up for simple human dignity. Henare is also outstanding, projecting a genuine sweetness and inner strength in the face of Dave’s relentless cruelty.
Stefan and Tony eventually bond over the mutual hatred of Dave, who resents Tony for being popular and singles him out for discipline at Jenny Pen’s wee hands. When Dave comes into Stefan and Tony’s room after dark, he tells racist jokes in the puppet’s voice, and then yanks on Tony’s catheter. Because both Stefan and Tony have physical ailments that make it hard for them to get away, they’re trapped with this madman and his devil-doll – and we’re trapped along with them. These scenes are intense and disturbing, but effective. They make the movie scarier and the situation feel more hopeless.
Dave and Jenny’s reign of terror takes on more or less the same form, day after day, and because of this, The Rule of Jenny Pen can get a little repetitive. Director James Ashcroft (who co-wrote the screenplay with Eli Kent) emphasizes the banal irritations of an institution, in ways that spread some of that discomfort to us. A scene like the one where an entertainer in a hideously grinning mask sings the insipid ditty “I’ve Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts” is meant to be grating – and it certainly is.
But Lithgow, Rush, and Henare are consistently exciting to watch, as their three old men scheme against and sabotage each other. There’s a darkly comic undercurrent to this movie, evident in the gusto of these performances – and also running beneath all the creepy shots of Jenny Pen, who looms large in the frame, with a blank expression that is equal parts ominous and hilarious.
More importantly, Ashcroft does a terrific job of capturing the frustrations of a man like Stefan, who was used to bossing people around, right up until the moment when his brain went haywire. The director follows in the footsteps of Australian and New Zealand filmmakers like George Miller and Peter Jackson, who take the exciting parts of the action, fantasy and horror genres – all the fights, chases, murders, intimidation, and wonder – and put them into movies about underdogs fighting for some kind of personal freedom. Stefan has no family to come visit, and his condition keeps deteriorating; but he’ll be damned if some dumb puppet is going to get the better of him. Stefan may not be the hero we want in the darkest of times, but he could well be the one who is obnoxious enough to see justice done.

Set in a New Zealand nursing home, the entertaining and creepy The Rule of Jenny Pen stars John Lithgow as an eccentric old man who uses a baby doll puppet to torment the home’s other residents. Geoffrey Rush plays a misanthropic newcomer who becomes an offbeat kind of hero when he tries to restore some order, with the help of his roommate, played by George Henare. Although this psychological thriller can be uncomfortable to watch at times, the performances – combined with the disturbing puppet imagery – bring a lot of life and imagination to a story about a petty dictator and an unlikely rebel."

There’s something uncanny about the office.
It has furniture and lights and doors, but nothing you would ever put in your own house. You eat in a little room they tell you to, wear drab office clothes and make cordial office friends. It’syou, but it’s not yourlife.It just kind of feels that way sometimes. A drop-shipped dupe of the designer handbag that is the human experience.
Severance is a show that explores the outer limits of this artificiality.It’s a paranoid Philip K. Dick mind-melterin a prestige TV package, exploring the unsettling otherness of an office setting that’s just slightly outside the bounds of reality.
Many of us have little choice but to spend much of our short time on earth existing in an office, which means we’re about as familiar with the look and feel of the space as we are with our own faces. When things are even just a little, tiny bit off, we notice. That’s the theory behind the “uncanny valley,” the idea that the closer humanoid robots look to real people, the more that subtle, slightly-askew differences will make them exponentially more freaky.
If a robot is a cartoony abstraction like Bender Rodriguez, people are totally fine with it. But if you deck him out in some fake skin over a highly articulated endoskeleton, ourmonkey-brain “flight” responsescan’t help but kick in. It’s how our brains evolved to perceive things, possibly to prevent us mingling with other early hominids.
ThinkDisney’s Hall of Presidents, or all thoseandroid girlfriendson display at CES. The more something resembles the real thing, the more that small, almost imperceivable differences matter. Achieving perfection is essentially the only antidote to this phenomenon.
The uncanny valley is what makes the CG animation of Bob Zemeckis movies so skin-crawling. It’s why we cringed through Mass Effect: Andromeda. The reason AI generated babies raise instinctual alarm bells. When something is notquiteright, it can feelverywrong.
In Severance, Lumon Headquarters is located in a fake town called Kier in a fake state called PE situated deep within the uncanny valley. The facility features sprawling, identical hallways of impeccably sterile decor. Dozens of meticulously labelled doors that can lead anywhere from a cookie-cutter conference room to a deranged faction of goat-keepers.
Lumon isn’t the workplace we know, it’s the one we visit in our nightmares, the mundane ones where you completely forgot about a project you were supposed to be working on for months and it’s dueright now. It’s a dreamlike space of fuzzy details and a barely-audible buzzing of dread.
Severance is heavily informed by the aesthetic of “liminal spaces,” impossibly vast, eerily familiar environments designed to instill a sense of dread and confusion. Imagine a dead mall that sprawls on for infinity, or a surreal fast food playplace with slides that don’t end and ball pits that are deeper than the diameter of the planet.
Liminal spaces came to prominence thanks to the spread of the Backrooms, acreepypasta that first appeared on 4chanback in 2019. “In the Backrooms,” wrote the surprisingly eloquent poster who will forever remain anon, there’s “nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in.”
The Backrooms is a true internet original,a memetic masterpiece that belongs to no one and every one. It spawned a series of short films,countless streamer-bait jump scare gameson Steam, and, soon, a major motion picture from A24.Severance creator Dan Erickson citedThe Backrooms, as well as its video game predecessor The Stanley Parable, as one of many inspirations for the show’s dreamlike unreality.
He also named The Matrix, The Truman Show, and Dark City, films featuring characters who realize they are trapped in an obscene simulacrum of life, manipulated by powerful forces beyond their control or understanding. Even before our naive heroes learn the truth, they begin their journey by seeing the slight cracks in the seemingly perfect facades around them– enlightenment achieved by way of the uncanny valley effect.
The notion ofawakening from a constructed realityruns deep within Severance, not only thematically but aesthetically. The Truman Show, in particular, with its deliberately anachronistic clockwork world, seems to inform the show's interpretation of the timeless essence of the office.
Lumon’s design language isn't a pastiche of any particular era, though the earth tone interiors and Brutalist tech evoke the ugly interiors of the ‘60s and ‘70s. The severed floor exists outside of any specific time or place the same way its employees exist outside of their real lives. It’s a boiled-down, hyperreal, evocative impression of what a workplace is.It’s not the office, it’s Officecore.
There’s been copious discussion about how Season 2 of Severance doesn’t quite live up to the high bar set by its predecessor. Some attribute that to unsatisfying follow-ups to the first season’s revelations. Others might point to a ramping up of the mystery box-ification that has plagued buzzworthy TV shows since Lost.
For myself, I’ve found the show slightly less interesting since it shifted its focus away from the workplace. Outdoor team-building exercises, diversions to hellish hometowns, and an increased emphasis on the outside world has diminished what made the show so special in the first place: the unsettling excursion into the uncanny valley of our artificial office lives."
"With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its wayandits audience.

Capcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.
But in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.
2016 was a bad year for Capcom.
The big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.
This was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.
All of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .
Achieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.
Capcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4.
2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema.
Unfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.
“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.
This directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op.
This downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.
But it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.
This slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.
It was clear something needed to change.
By the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability.
While neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.
“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”
Those constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6.
""We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V,"" Nakayama says. ""And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title.""
All this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards.“There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.
“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”
The team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.
There was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master.
“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.”
Street Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series.
While they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.
While Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.
Around the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience.
“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”
If you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.
“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”
Itsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance.
No other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened.
Firstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.
“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”
Monster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.
This created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.
But the reality was that Monster Hunterdidhave fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.
Released in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.
“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”
It was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”
It wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world.
“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”Tsujimoto says.
One important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.
This explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.
“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”
Monster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call.
“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&D teams were divided into R&D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”
Takeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.
There were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.
“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.
The game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series.
But Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time.
“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.
The result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history.
Naturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?
Ampo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”
But despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.
Around the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.
“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.”
Itsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.
The 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. ""Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively,"" Itsuno says. ""When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”
This vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should.
Ampo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, ""So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.”
This meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.
“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”
Since 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.
Focusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat.
But what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.
Many of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever.
When asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”
Monster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”

"In case you missed the news, Bruce Wayne is getting a new look when DC Comicsrelaunches its flagship Batman series this September. Artist Jorge Jiménez has designed a new Batsuit that brings the classic blue cape and cowl back into the spotlight. After almost 90 years on the stands, DC is still tweaking the Dark Knight’s iconic costume.

But how does the new Batsuit measure up to the classics? What are the greatest Batman costumes of all time? We’ve handpicked our 10 favorite Batsuits from the comics, ranging from the original Golden Age costume to more modern reinterpretations like Batman Incorporated and Batman Rebirth. Scroll down to see them all.
And if Batman movies are more your speed, make sure you check outour ranked list of all the movie Batsuits.
1989’s Batman movie introduced a radically different, all-black Batsuit that remains one of the Dark Knight’s most iconic suits in any medium. DC never fully committed to porting that costume over to the comics (outside ofactual Burton-Verse tie-ins like Batman ‘89), but they did introduce a Batsuit inspired by the movies in the 1995 storyline “Troika.”
This new Batsuit adopted the all-black approach to Batman’s body but retained a more traditional blue cape and cowl. It even added more extreme elements like spikes on Batman’s boots, although those elements were toned down after the suit’s initial introduction. Regardless, the result was a more intimidating and stealthy Batsuit that became the default look for the Caped Crusader for the remainder of the ‘90s.
When Bruce Wayne returned following his apparent death in 2008’s Final Crisis, DC celebrated with the launch of a new series, Batman Incorporated, and a new costume designed by David Finch. That Batman Inc. suit is notable both for bringing back the classic yellow oval around the Bat emblem and for ditching the black trunks.
In many ways, the Batman Inc. suit feels like a more successful and visually cohesive version of what DC tried to accomplish with Batman’s New 52 suit a couple of years later. It introduced a more functional quality to Batman’s look, creating the impression that the Batsuit was less spandex than a true suit of armor, yet it avoided mucking up the design with too many stray lines. It also helped create some much-needed visual distinction between Bruce and Dick Grayson, who was also serving as Batman at the time.
The only element that slightly holds back the Batman Inc. look is the slightly goofy-looking armored codpiece. We’re not sure what the thinking was there.
The most recent creation on this list, there’s a reason the Absolute Batman Batsuit makes such a strong first impression. This is Batman at his most imposing.
Absolute Batman takes place in a rebooted DCU where Bruce Wayne lacks many of the advantages of his traditional counterpart, like a mansion and billions of dollars. Still, he manages to create quite an impressive crimefighting arsenal. Nearly every inch of this Batsuit is a weapon, from the razor-sharp ear daggers to the removable Bat emblem that doubles as a battle axe. Even the cape is completely redesigned, consisting of several flexible, arm-like tendrils.
Ultimately, though, it’s the sheer size of this Batman that makes the Absolute suit stand out. Writer Scott Snyder jokingly referred to Absolute Batman as “the Batman who lifts,” and you can see why.
In the alternate timeline of Flashpoint, Joe Chill killed a young Bruce Wayne, leading to a grieving Thomas Wayne becoming Batman instead. This darker, very different Batman needs a darker, very different Batsuit, and he got one in the form of a costume that drops the traditional yellow elements in favor of bold red accents. The Bat emblem, utility belt, and leg holsters are all a deep crimson, creating a unique and cool look. Couple that with the dramatic shoulder spikes on the cape and the fact that this Batman is known to wield guns and a sword, and you have one of the most visually arresting takes on an alternate universe Batman.
Artist Lee Bermejo has drawn and painted Batman a lot over the years, from the Batman/Deathblow crossover to the Joker graphic novel to theinfamous Batman: Damned. In that time, Bermejo has established a distinctive and very striking take on the iconic Batsuit, one unlike any other at DC Comics.
Bermejo’s Batsuit is about as far from the typical spandex look as you can get. This is armor, pure and simple,and the artist’s Batman is as much about function as he is form. But the goal isn’t necessarily realism here. Bermejo’s Batman is also a haunting figure, one mired in dirt and grime and a certain Gothic quality. This Batsuit, as much as any other, inspired the look of Robert Pattinson’s Dark Knight in 2022’s The Batman.
The DC multiverse is a vast place, and we’ve seen countless variations of the Batsuit appear on numerous worlds. That being said, none can truly measure up to Gotham by Gaslight’s Batman. It’s as if the character was made for this steampunk Victorian setting. The Batsuit perfectly translates into this bold revamp that trades skintight spandex for stitched leather and a billowing cloak.
Of course, it helps that the original Gotham by Gaslight series was illustrated by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. Mignola’s Batman is truly iconic, bathed in shadow and looking as if he were chiseled out of raw granite. And even though Mignola’s DC days are long behind him, this incarnation of the character lives on throughfollow-up stories like Gotham by Gaslight: The Kryptonian Age.
It says a lot about the original Bob Kane/Bill Finger-designed Batsuit that the design has survived with only modest changes for the better part of 90 years. All the right ingredients for a truly iconic superhero look were there from the start.
But in addition to serving as the basis for every Batsuit since, the Golden Age design is also notable for boasting some interesting features you don’t normally see elsewhere. The curved ears on Batman’s cowl give him an even more menacing vibe, while the purple gloves add a welcome pop of color. Even the cape is different in a fun way, being more akin to actual bat wings than a traditional superhero cape. It’s always exciting to see modern artists revisit this design.
For the majority of their hugely popular run on DC’s flagship Batman series, Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo focused on the New 52 costume. As we’ve already covered, that suit served as a notable attempt at updating the Caped Crusader’s look with a more modern, tactical bent, but that approach has been done better elsewhere. Case in point, Capullo’s own redesign that debuted just in time for the DC Rebirth relaunch.
Batman’s Rebirth costume is an upgrade on the New 52 suit in pretty much every way. It retains the tactical look while also downplaying some of the extraneous lines and details. It brings some much-needed color back into Batman’s look both with the yellow outline around the Bat emblem and the distinctive purple inner lining of the cape (a throwback to Batman’s Golden Age roots). It’s a bit of a shame that DC phased out this Batsuit after only a couple of years. As far as modern redesigns go, this is the one to beat.
The late ‘60s and ‘70s were a very transformational time for DC’s Batman comics. The books veered away from the camp that defined Batman’s Silver Age adventures and the live-action TV series toward more serious action/adventure and detective stories. Three artists really came to define Batman’s look in this period - Neal Adams, Jim Aparo, and José Luis García-López.
It’s not that these artists dramatically changed the makeup of Batman’s costume. This is the same blue cape and cowl and Bat emblem with yellow oval that was popularized by the TV series. But what unites Adams, Aparo, and Garcia-López’s work is the physicality they brought to the character. Gone was the burly brawler of the Silver Age, replaced by a leaner and more lithe Batman. Batman is basically a ninja superhero, so it makes sense that he be built more like a gymnast than a bodybuilder.
For many fans, this is still the standard by which all other Batman costumes are judged. That’s especially thanks to Garcia-López, whose art has adorned bedsheets, lunchboxes, T-shirts, and countless other Batman merch over the years.
Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee’s Hush storyline is often regarded as the start of the modern era of Batman comics. That’s thanks to Lee’s instantly iconic redesign of the Batsuit as much as anything else.
With the Hush costume, Lee brought a new level of elegant simplicity to the Batsuit. Gone is the yellow oval that persisted for decades, to be replaced by a sleek, black emblem. Lee’s knack for rendering dynamic, detailed, and very powerful superhero physiques is on full display in his Batman. Readers needed to believe that this Dark Knight could face down a gauntlet of his greatest foes – and Superman for good measure, and they certainly did.
The Hush redesign immediately became the default look for Batman going forward. Lee created a clear model that subsequent artists like Andy Kubert and Tony Daniel followed closely. While individual artists varied in whether they chose the blue or black cape and cowl, the rest of the details remained consistent. It’s telling that, after a period of focusing on more armored Batman costumes in the New 52 and DC Rebirth eras, DC eventually threw in the towel and went back to the Hush costume. It just plain works.
Artist Jorge Jiménez is no stranger to Batman at this point, but he’ll be debuting a new Batsuit when he and writer Matt Fractionkick off DC’s relaunched Batman series in September 2025.
The newest Batsuit isn’t a massive deviation from the now-standard Hush costume, though it does have a few interesting embellishments all its own. Where most artists in recent years have gravitated toward the black cape and cowl, Jiménez is bringing back the blue. Not only that, the cape is now heavily shaded, creating a stark contrast between the inner and older folds and bringing to mind Bruce Timm’s Batman: The Animated Series look. Even the Bat emblem is blue now, as well as sporting a bigger and more angular shape.
After all this time, it’s great to see Batman still trying out new looks. But will the latest redesign have the staying power of Batman’s most iconic suits? Only time will tell.

"As any younger sibling who grew up on Mario platformers knows, Luigi is gaming's ultimate Player 2. Nintendo's green-capped member of the Mario Bros. has lived a lifetime in the shadow of his older twin Mario, only stepping out for a taste of solo stardom in his ghostbusting Luigi's Mansion series.

As we move closer toSwitch 2, we’re celebrating another console generation of Luigi and Player 2s everywhere with a complete list of every Luigi game on Switch.
There are 17 games on Switch that let you play as Luigi. He’s the main character in only two games (Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD and Luigi’s Mansion 3) and the co-lead in one (Mario & Luigi: Brothership).
Luigi’s first starring role on Switch was inLuigi’s Mansion 3, the third entry in the character’s only solo series to date. Luigi’s Mansion 3 sees our timid hero and his green gooey clone team up with Professor E. Gadd to battle ghosts and save his friends from King Boo’s haunted hotel.
Luigi’s Mansion 2 HDis a remake of the 2013 Nintendo 3DS game Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon. This second game in the spooky series sees Luigi ghostbusting his way through the mansions of Evershade Valley to once again capture King Boo and save his brother.
Sure, it's not exclusively a 'Luigi game,' butMario & Luigi: Brothershipcertainly puts the brothers on even footing. Brothership is the first release in the Mario & Luigi series since Paper Jam in 2014. Players take on the role of both brothers, who must traverse puzzles and platforming challenges to restore the kingdom of Concordia.
The first Switch game to feature Luigi as a playable character wasMario Kart 8 Deluxe. Luigi appears as a middleweight racer with a well-balanced stat distribution that slightly favors speed and handling. His appearance in an ad for the original Wii U version of Mario Kart 8 spawned theLuigi Death Stare meme.
Luigi next appeared in the Nintendo-Ubisoft collaborationMario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. The tactical RPG features both Luigi and Rabbid Luigi, a Rabbid who dresses (and often behaves) like his human counterpart, as possible party members.
Luigi hit the court as one of 16 playable launch characters in 2018’sMario Tennis Aces. As is often true for Luigi in Mario sports games, he’s a balanced, “all-around” character in Aces. His specialty shot, Pipe Cannon, blasts him into the air to set him up for a powerful spike.
Luigi is one of 20 playable characters inSuper Mario Party. The younger of the Mario Bros. has appeared alongside his brother in every Mario Party game to date, including the two others further down this list. This is the first Mario Party game released for Switch and Nintendo’s ninth best-selling game on the platform,according to the company.
Luigi appears inSuper Smash Bros. Ultimateas an unlockable character. He is one of 12 characters to be playable in all five Smash games. According toLumiRank’s2025 tier list, which compiled the opinions of 93 ranked Smash players, Luigi is an A+-tier fighter and the 18th best overall.
Luigi is a playable character in the 2019 platformerNew Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe. This is an expanded version of NSMBU for Wii U that includes the expansion New Super Luigi U. Luigi stars as the main character in this expansion, which incorporates his higher jump, remixes levels from the base game, and adds a 100-second timer to each level.
Alongside Mario, Toad, and Toadette, Luigi is one of four playable characters inSuper Mario Maker 2. The level-building platformer allows players to create their own Mario levels using assets from Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, New Super Mario Bros. U, and Super Mario 3D World.
Like the original Wii U release,Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Furycan be played entirely as Luigi. Here, he controls similarly to Mario, albeit with a slightly higher jump and slightly less traction, making him play a bit more ‘floaty’ and ‘slippery’ than his red-capped counterpart.
Luigi hit the links with Mario and friends inMario Golf: Super Rush. One of 22 playable characters, he boasts decent control and excellent speed stats, making him a great option for Super Rush’s new Speed Golf mode. His special shot, Ice Flower Freeze, freezes the ground upon the ball’s impact, creating a hazardous area for opponents.
Luigi returns for the second iteration of Mario Party on Switch:Mario Party Superstars. Unlike Super Mario Party before it, Superstars is not an original game but rather a modern collection of minigames, boards, and mechanics from the series’ past.
Mario Strikers: Battle League Football, the latest Mario soccer/football game, features Luigi as one of 16 playable characters. Luigi is a well-balanced footballer who excels in technique, a skill that determines a character’s ability to dribble, curve their shot, and shoot accurately.
Luigi (and Rabbid Luigi) returned for Ubisoft and Nintendo’s tactical sequel,Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Luigi is labeled a Sneak Attacker due to his ranged weaponry and low health.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the latest 2D Mario platformer, features Luigi as a playable alternative to Mario. The difference between the two characters here is purely aesthetic, as the Mario Bros. play identically to one another.
Unsurprisingly, Luigi is playable inSuper Mario Party Jamboree, the biggest and arguably best game in Nintendo’s flagship party series. In addition to being a playable character, Luigi appears as part of Jamboree’s new Buddy mechanic, where he has the chance to change a player’s dice rolls from their initial numbers to 10s.
The next time you'll be able to play as Luigi is anew Mario Kart game, expected to release alongside theSwitch 2, that features double the usual amount of racers. Yes, that means24 racerson each track. Otherwise, I'm sure Mario will bring Luigi along for whatever his next adventure is. Plenty more games arerumoredto be releasing with Nintendo's next console generation, and the next updates will likely come out of aNintendo Direct scheduled for April 2.

"I think today might be the day my wallet throws in the towel. Woot is coming in hot with one of thebest PS5 game dealsI’ve seen all year, and Sony’s decided we’ve all earned a full-blown audio upgrade. Between the markdowns onnoise-canceling headphones,portable speakers, andhome theater gear, it's giving ""treat yourself"" energy with ""I won’t regret this at all"" delusion.

I want at least three of these, but I’m pretending to be financially responsible and only putting two in my cart. If you’ve been eyeballing anything fromhigh-end headphonestosmart display cases for your action figures (I meancollectibles), now’s probably the best time to stop window shopping and start adding to your cart.
This Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code ""IFPRZAZ"" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16"" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.
$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.
I think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.
If you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.
At $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.
$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.
This speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.
Crisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.
This speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.
Bass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.
XM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.
A wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.
My living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.
I didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.
This TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.
I want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.
This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.

"The first episode of My Hero Academia: Vigilantes is now streaming on Crunchyroll.

My Hero Academia is nearing its conclusion, but its first seven seasons – with their focus on the heroes-in-training of U.A. High School – have only shown us a sliver of a fascinating world where most people have superpowers (a.k.a. Quirks) and some parlay their Quirk into a lucrative career. Enter My Hero Academia: Vigilantes, an adaptation of the manga of the same name written by Hideyuki Furuhashi and illustrated by Betten Court. This is both a spin-off and a prequel to the main show,, and it’s not only a worthy expansion of the My Hero Academia universe, but a dazzling anime whose visual style pays tribute to classic superhero comics.
The anime follows Koichi Haimawari, an 18-year-old with a desire to help people despite having a less-than-stellar Quirk. His power allows him to travel quickly across any flat surface – as long as he makes contact with that surface with at least three limbs. Unfortunately, he’s no Flash: at top speed, he only moves about as fast as a bicycle. In many ways, Koichi is like My Hero Academia lead Deku: Both are big-hearted optimists and admirers of the world’s greatest superhero, All Might. In others, he’s a different kind of superhero for MHA: An everyman. The premiere does a lot of work to establish Koichi’s relatability.  Sure he has a Quirk, but it’s not one that’s useful for superheroics. He tries to help people, but cowers when things get too real.
Even in the first episode, it is clear Vigilantes is giving audiences a different perspective on My Hero Academia. This is not a show about big villains with grand schemes fighting the A-listers. Its concerns are smaller, like the frustration of a convenience-store work being robbed by a small-time vandal with Wolverine claws. These are the villains that aren't prioritized or even acknowledged by cops or heroes. It’s in line with the parent series: The best parts of MHA’s world-building involve the way regular people view hero society; in its earliest goings, it portrayed heroes as celebrities who sometimes cared more about endorsements than saving lives. Vigilantes promises to be a fascinating new spin on that idea, with a street-level view of a world where superpowers don’t just exist, but are common.
Without a doubt, the visuals are the main draw of the series so far. Director Kenichi Suzuki (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders) and the animators at Bones Studio B (Mob Psycho 100) give Vigilante an art style that is distinct from the flagship series – even compared to other series adapted from manga, this one has distinctly comic-book-y aesthetic. The character outlines are thick, the shading is striking, and the colors pop. Every frame is vibrant; like the Spider-Verse movies, sounds effects are rendered as onscreen onomatopoeia. (“Bam!” “Pow!,” etc.). The first episode doesn't reach the level of epic action of My Hero Academia, but these touches make even small alley brawls feel unique and dynamic.
Vigilantes is its own, smaller-scale story completely unconcerned with top heroes and U.A. High School. But some familiar faces show up nonetheless. Fortunately, these cameos and guest appearances (in the premiere, at least) aren’t shoehorned in as reminders of Vigilantes’ roots. Instead, they’re just another example of the fully realized, lived-in world in which these episodes take place in.
My Hero Academia: Vigilantes is a worthy spin-off of the popular superhero anime. Its small scale story and focus on street-level heroism expands the show's world in interesting ways, while introducing a relatable, everyman hero. The anime boasts a dazzling art direction that translate the vibrant colors and lively onomatopoeia of a classic superhero comic to the TV screen."
"With the wide release of the five-minuteSuperman sneak peekthat was first shown at CinemaCon earlier this week, one thing stands out even more than Krypto’s lovable (if painful for Superman) hijinks: It’s the fact that James Gunn understands the most important thing he can do for his reboot of not just the Man of Steel, but the entire DC universe, is to make us care about the characters. All of the characters, great and small, Kryptonian and human, canine and, yes, even robot.Gigglingrobots.

The extended preview features footage from the film that we’ve seen before, including of course Kal-El’s incredibly cute super dog arriving on the icy scene when his master is at a real low point. But it expands on that sequence fromthe film’s first trailer, showing us that Krypto is very much the troublemaker Gunn has described him to be. Yes, Superman is bloodied and beaten, pleading with Krypto to take him “home,” but all the pup wants to do is play. And he makes this point by jumping on the hurt Supes with all of his super-dog strength, and even dragging Kal-El’s leg up into an extremely awkward yet entirely believable pose. “Play with me, Dad!” he’s saying, in deeds if not words. It’s all very funny and it makes you love Krypto even more than you already did. Oh yes, you will believe that a super-powered dog can fly – and be lovable.
But Supermanishurt, and Krypto finally gets it, bringing Kal to the Fortress of Solitude. And that’s where we meet that giggling robot, who is one of the keys to understanding why James Gunn is so good at what he does. But before we get to that, consider that the first time we ever saw Gunn’s version of the Last Son of Krypton in action, he was in bad shape – beaten up, bleeding, needing hisdogto save him. And we don’t yet know who dished out this punishment either, so this first image of Gunn’s version of Superman battered and broken is not for the benefit of getting a villain over. There’s no “look how scary this antagonist is because they beat the hell out of the Man of Steel.” The purpose of beginning the entire marketing push for this film is to show Superman in dire straits and in need of help. It’s a far cry from the typical introduction of any superhero, let alonethesuperhero, and yet it makes perfect sense coming from Gunn.
It’s the Harrison Ford Syndrome. Which isn’t so much a syndrome as it is a legitimate strength of Ford’s on screen persona. Either way, think about how badly Indiana Jones gets roughed up. We don’t love him because he’s so good at fighting; it’s because he’s tired and in pain just like the rest of us. Think about the scared-as-shit look on Ford’s face when he was on the run in The Fugitive, the desperate man leaping off of a dam en route to prove his innocence. Think about the hurt on Han Solo’s face, the fully bruised ego when he thought Leia was into Luke and not him at the start of Empire. It’s an everyman appeal that few actors have ever really been able to pull off. Honestly, it might just be Ford and Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley that do it completely right. The point is, seeing your heroes beat up a little bit kind of makes you love them even more, especially when they rise to the occasion later to be, you know,heroes, despite everything they’ve been through.
Gunn knows this, and he has a track record of putting his characters through the ringer. Think back to the first time we met the Guardians of the Galaxy. The first trailer for that film shows that nobody knows Star-Lord’s name and that it stings a little. And yes, Star-Lord was a little known character from the depths of Marvel’s roster, and Superman is… well, it’s almost apples to oranges, but Gunn’s approach is exactly the same here. Let’s put some dents in our main character as quickly as we can. Let’s meet a protagonist at a moment when they’renotheroic, not saving the day, when they don’t even have the upper hand – that’s part of what makes Gunn’s superhero work resonate as well as anybody’s ever been able to.
So giving us a Superman who right off the bat has broken ribs, a jacked-up bladder, and is in awful pain even when/because his robots are healing him… it’s a very Gunn choice, and it goes a long way to getting us invested in his version of a character who, let’s not forget, has had like 10 movies and 15 TV shows or something at this point and is older than your grandparents. Superman and all his pals have been around forever, so why should we care about yet another version of his story?
And not for nothing, it’s important to remember that a significant criticism has been lobbed at Superman over the years saying his invulnerability and squeaky clean boy scout-ness are just plain boring. He was, after all, created to be the best of us, but crafting interesting narratives around an overpowered alien with only a single weakness can start to get hard after a century. So howdoyou make this familiar story engaging? Opening on a shot of a damaged Kal-El is a great start, but we still need to fall for the supporting cast.
And that brings us back to the giggling robot. Once Krypto gets his dad into the Fortress (which is a cool re-thinking of the classic Richard Donner ice-crystal Fortress of Solitude, only in this case one that grows out of the snowy landscape on command), the robots take custody of Superman as they carry the injured hero in to treat his wounds. In the comics we know that the ‘bot known asKelex is usually the main caretaker of the Fortress, although here we see the main robot has the simple designation of “4” on the Superman-shield on his chest.
As they tend to Superman, 4 (voiced by Alan Tudyk) introduces the newest robot of the group: “Meet 12. She’s new.” Superman nods to her weakly, and 12 practically blushes, despite being made of metal, as she giggles and says “Oh, he looked at me!”
12 has just that one line of dialogue (we're not sure who’s voicing the character but it’s gotta be someone we know, right?), but we're already so invested in her and these other robots that we're a little embarrassed to admit it. 4 also tells Kal-El that there’s no need to thank them for their service because they have “no consciousness whatsoever. Merely automatons here to serve.” But you know what? We're calling bullshit on that right now, because you can be guaranteed that half of us are going to be crying when we see the movie and one of these robots gets killed (something that in fact has already been teased in the first trailer). There’s also something about Tudyk’s delivery of those lines, like he’s dripping with sarcasm. No consciousness my red-briefs-clad-butt.
So even while comics fans can dig in and try to figure out if 4 is Kelex or how Superman’s biology works (he has intestines!) or whatever other lore or Easter egg stuff comes to mind, Gunn isn’t actually that concerned with that stuff. At minimum, we feel comfortable saying it doesn’t seem like his first priority. Yes, he understands the geeky things, he’s a fan himself and he’s read the comics – and loves them, no doubt – but what he’s doing here is building out little character moments and beats that will make us actually care about these people. And robots. And dogs!
This isn’t gonna be aSuperman movieas much as it is a James Gunn movie, and we can’t wait."
"This article contains spoilers for theInvincibleSeason 3 finale.

After eight episodes featuringhugecharacter deaths, multiple Invincibles (Steven Yeun), and so, so much blood and guts, Invincible Season 3 is in the books. Unlike Season 2, which ended with a relatively quieter tag for the finale, Season 3 not only teed up atonof storylines for the already-in-production Season 4… It also included a mid-credits scene that sets up a storyline Invincible co-creator Robert Kirkman never got to do in the comic books.
Before we get to that closing montage – and mid-credits scene – a bit of explanation about the finale itself. It’s for the most part one, long fight scene as Invincible, Oliver (Christian Convery) and Atom Eve (Gillian Jacobs) take on the vicious Viltrumite warrior Conquest (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Conquest is ostensibly on Earth to prepare the world for Viltrumite, er, conquest, but as he explains repeatedly to Invincible, he really loves destroying and torturing things.
After Conquest seemingly kills Eve, Invincible, who has had both hands broken, absolutely loses it and bashes Conquest to “death” with his own head. Some might say this is sweet, sweet vengeance for Negan (also Morgan) famously bashing Glenn Rhee’s (also Yeun) head in on The Walking Dead, but it comes straight from the Invincible comics, which came out in 2009. So incredibly satisfying to watch if you want #Justice4Glenn, but also mostly just a nice coincidence.
In any case, Eve isnotdead and reveals – as fans who watched the Atom Eve Special learned – that when she’s put in moments of extreme stress, she’s able to get past the mental blocks that otherwise stop her from transmuting living matter, instead of just inert materials. However, eagle-eyed fans will also note that when she transmutes Invincible’s costume later in the scene when they’re about to have sex, it’s made of plants… So she may have broken through these blocks in a bigger way than she realizes.
The final conclusion of the episode, and the arc of the season, is that Invincible visits his half-brother Oliver in a hospital bed. And while Oliver thinks Invincible is going to tell him that killing is wrong… Invincible has decided that if anyone threatens his family again, just as Angstrom Levy (Sterling K. Brown) did in the previous episode, and Conquest this week, he won’t hesitate to kill them.
It’s a surprising move from the show, though again one pulled directly from the comic books, almost word for word. While the large majority of superhero media, from TV shows to movies, to the original comics wrestle with the “should heroes kill?” debate, Invincible has firmly fallen on the side of “yeah, when necessary.” Still, an ominous musical sting played under Invincible’s pro-death penalty statement points to more challenges coming the way of his realigned moral compass. So expect that this debate might not be as open and shut as the finale indicates.
Beyond that, the real eyebrow-raising moments are saved for that montage. So let’s break those Season 4 teases down, one by one.
Last seen in Season 2, Episode 6 “It’s Not That Simple,” the Sequids are incredibly dangerous Martian brain slugs who almost beat the Guardians of the Globe in their last encounter, including Invincible and Atom Eve. They had taken over the brain of an astronaut named Rus Livingston (Ben Schwartz), who was finally freed and brought back to Earth after a horrifying, harrowing ordeal. Unfortunately for Rus, after he returned to his apartment, which had been trashed by Shapesmith (also Schwartz), he threw up a Sequid in the sink – which immediately took over his body, again.
That plotline has been on hold since the aforementioned episode, but looks like it’s coming back in a big way in Season 4. While everything else has been going on this season, the Sequids have been steadily building an army in the sewers, including what looks like hundreds of human workers and others. Given we were told that if the Sequids ever made it to Earth it was game over for humanity… Yeah, that’s bad! “Not long now,” says Russequid. Uh-oh!
At the end of Season 3, Episode 4, “You Were My Hero,” the unstoppable Battle Beast was fighting a Viltrumite in the cold, dark reaches of space. We catch up to him here, as well as the scattered remains of the Viltrumite… BB is in suspended animation but is quickly picked up by an alien ship. And a few seconds after that, he wakes up, ready for battle. He wants “more!”
If things pan out on the TV show the same way they do in the comic, the ship was part of the Coalition of Planets, the group fighting back against the Viltrumites. Alongside Allen the Alien (Seth Rogen) and Nolan Grayson (J.K. Simmons), it looks like the Coalition finally has a fighting chance against the unstoppable aliens.
In one of the best casting coups on the show, the creepy, Cenobite-esque Technicians who fixed up Angstrom Levy, as first seen in Season 3, Episode 7, are voiced by Doug Bradley. You might know him better as Pinhead from the Hellraiser series. And in this teaser of coming attractions, we get to hear Bradley say somethingextremelyPinhead.
After revealing that Angstrom has a new arm thanks to them (Invincible accidentally amputated it last episode), Angstrom asks what they want in return. “Angstrom Levy, you have witnessed what our ambitions have done to our world, and what we have had to do to ourselves to survive here,” a Technician explains.
Angstrom thinks they want a new home, but the Technicians have other ideas. “That is only the beginning of the delights we will achieve together,” the Technician says. Now, the classic Hellraiser line is “We have such sights to show you” while the 2022 remake employed “greater delights await.” But come on, if you weren’t Leo Dicaprio pointing at the screen meme at that line, what are we even doing here?
In any case, to explain what the Technicians are up to is to spoil one of the great plot twists of the Invincible comics. Suffice it to say that they will tie into the action, and we have not seen the last of either Angstrom or the not-Cenobites.
Despite Invincible demanding Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins) show him Conquest’s dead body, it turns out that the dead body was a fake. In fact, Cecil has Conquest locked in a massive, underground chamber as the Viltrumite’s body reconstitutes itself.
Donald (Chris Diamantopoulos), Cecil’s right-hand man, protests that this is a mistake. And if you’ve read the comics, you know that Donald is correct: you cannot hold a massively powered Viltrumite like Conquest with mere Earth materials, no matter how secure Cecil makes the facility. Unfortunately for Cecil, as well as the world, in this case, Invincible was correct: Conquest should have been killed.
That brings us to the mid-credits scene. While everything else we’ve explained above happens in the comic books by Kirkman, Ryan Ottley, and Cory Walker, this scene is completely new. And in fact, it’s something Kirkman always wanted to do in the comics, but never found room for. Oh, and there’s a fantastic, surprise voice actor involved.
Right after the end credits begin, we cut to Damien Darkblood (Clancy Brown), the demon detective we haven’t seen since Season 1, Episode 4, “Neil Armstrong, Eat Your Heart Out.” In case you forgot – it aired back in 2021, after all – Damien was investigating Omni-Man, then set up by Cecil and sent back to Hell. As he was sucked down to the inferno, he threatened vengeance on Cecil… And that’s (potentially) what we’re seeing here.
Now missing his trenchcoat, Damien creates a summoning circle, which calls a demon lord voiced by none other than Bruce Campbell. And Damien hails to the king, baby, by bringing “the great beast… welcome news.” Damien explains that he has the means to restore the demon to his former glory, and the “infernal throne.” The key? A “surface dweller of great power, likes of which this planet has not seen for eons.” And furthermore, Damien explains that “his blackened heart will be bound to your service.” And how will they do that? By conjuring “him” to Hell.
In the comics, Damien Darkblood was even more of a blink-and-you-miss-him character than he was on the TV show. But as Kirkman explained to theCartoonist Kayfabe podcastin 2020, there was originally more planned.
“The thing that I really regret is I never had an adventure where the superheroes went into Hell,” Kirkman explained. “There’s been so many superhero comics where it’s like, they got to go fight Mephisto or something, and I was like, ah jeez, I never got around to that. And the Damien Darkblood character was there so I could eventually do a story like that, and I never got around to it.”
Part of the reason for this may be that the initial storyline and reveal of Omni-Man as a bad guy was supposed to go nearly double the length that it did in the comic. It ultimately came to a head in issues 12 and 13, versus the planned 25. That meant there just wasn’t as much room for Darkblood to be investigating Omni-Man, because… Well, there was nothing left to investigate. So credit to Kirkman and company for letting that planned story play out on the TV show in a way we never saw in the books.
The big question here is: who is Damien Darkblood referring to? Is it Invincible? Omni-Man? Cecil? We’ll know more when Season 4 of Invincible premieres on Prime Video."
"Tron fans have reason to be excited in 2025. Following a long dormant period, the franchise is racing its way back into theaters this October with a new sequel called Tron: Ares. The third Tron movie stars Jared Leto as the titular character, a program who ventures into the real world on a high-stakes yet very mysterious mission.

But is it safe to call Ares a sequel? Visually, this new movie is clearly cut from the same cloth as 2010’s Tron: Legacy.The newly released trailermakes that much apparent. And with Nine Inch Nails stepping in for Daft Punk, it’s obvious the electronica-heavy score remains as big a priority as ever.
But in other ways, Ares is looking less like a direct sequel and more like a soft reboot of the franchise. Where are all the surviving characters from Legacy? Why aren’t stars Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde returning for Ares? Why is Jeff Bridges of all people the one Tron veteran confirmed for the cast of Ares? Let’s take a deeper look at how Legacy set itself up for a sequel, and why Ares seems to be ignoring that setup.
Tron: Legacy mainly revolves around the shared struggle of Garrett Hedlund’s Sam Flynn and Olivia Wilde’s Quorra. Sam is the son of Bridges’ character, Kevin Flynn, the CEO of telecom giant Encom who disappeared in 1989. In Legacy, Sam ventures into the digital landscape known as The Grid to find his father and prevent Kevin’s creation CLU from leading a digital army into the real world.
As Sam reunites with his father, he also meets Quorra. Quorra is a member of a race known as ISOs, digital lifeforms who appeared spontaneously in The Grid. Quorra is proof that life finds a way, even inside a computer simulation. In the end, Sam defeats CLU and returns to the real world with Quorra in tow. The world’s first digital lifeform has been transformed into flesh and blood.
Legacy’s ending lays a pretty clear path for a sequel. Sam himself is finally ready to embrace his responsibility as Encom’s largest shareholder. Rather than simply play annual pranks on the Encom board, Sam is prepared to lead the company into a brighter and more open-source future. Quorra is by his side, serving as living proof of the true wonders that await in the digital realm.
Legacy sets up an ongoing storyline for both Sam and Quorra. In fact, the home video release even includes a short film called “Tron: The Next Day,” showing Sam returning to Encom to begin shepherding the company into a new era.
But despite that, neither Hedlund nor Wilde seem to be returning for Tron: Ares. They’re both very conspicuous by their absence in the sequel. On some level, it’s not surprising that Disney would want to pivot to a different, more standalone direction for Ares.Legacy grossed $409.9 million worldwideon a budget of $170 million (not including marketing costs). If not an outright failure, it wasn’t quite the smash hit Disney was hoping for. Like 2012’s John Carter and 2013’s Lone Ranger, Legacy is one of a number of underperforming live-action movies from an era before Disney really started to lean on Marvel and Star Wars. The studio may have decided that Legacy didn’t strike enough of a chord with moviegoers that directly continuing the plot made much sense.
Still, as we’ve explored, Sam and Quorra are too central to the narrative of Tron to just completely ignore. Are we meant to assume Sam gave up on his mission to build a better Encom? Did Quorra grow tired of the real world and return to The Grid? The absence of these characters leaves a major void in the franchise, and we hope Ares finds some way of at least acknowledging Sam and Quorra’s importance, if not bringing them back in unannounced cameo roles.
Hedlund and Wilde aren’t the only Legacy actors whose absence in the Ares cast is baffling. There’s also Cillian Murphy, whose character was clearly being set up for much bigger things in a third Tron movie.
Murphy very briefly appears in an uncredited role in Legacy, playing Edward Dillinger, Jr., the son of David Warner’s Edward Dillinger from the original Tron. The younger Dillinger is introduced as the head of Encom’s software development team, and a fierce opponent of Sam’s commitment to free, open-source software.
It goes without saying that Murphy wasn’t cast just to appear in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo role. Dillinger was obviously intended to play a bigger part in a future sequel, where he likely would have become the main human antagonist, just as his father was in Tron. Dillinger’s role likely would have coincided with the return of the Master Control Program, the sinister entity that served as the main digital villain of the first movie.
Judging from the Tron: Ares trailer, the MCP itself may be back in play. Ares and his fellow programs are marked by glowing red highlights, which is the calling card of the MCP, just as CLU’s faction was orange and Tron was blue. That suggests a sinister undertone to Ares’ mission. We don’t know if he’s meant to be hero or villain. He doesn’t seem to understand much about his mission either. But if the MCP is back, why hasn’t Edward Dillinger returned, too? Why is Gillian Anderson’s new character suddenly the focus of the Encom board?
That said, we do know that Evan Peters is playing a character named Julian Dillinger, so at least it appears that the Dillinger clan has a part to play in this story. And it’s always possible that Murphy (who, again, wasn’t actually credited in Legacy) is still secretly returning for the new film.
Arguably the most baffling omission of all from the Tron: Ares cast is Bruce Boxleitner. If this is a Tron movie, where is Tron himself? In the original movie, Boxleitner played both Encom executive Alan Bradley and the heroic security program Tron. Boxleitner reprised the Alan role in Tron: Legacy, while it was eventually revealed that CLU’s bodyguard Rinzler was a reprogrammed Tron. When last we saw Rinzler in Legacy, he had fallen into the Sea of Simulation, which wiped away his new programming and restored the hero within.
Sadly, it doesn’t appear that Boxleitner is returning for Ares for either role. We can deal with Alan being written out of the picture, but is the plan really to make a Tron movie without its namesake? Or is it possible that Tron has been recast with a younger actor? Perhaps that’s who Cameron Monaghan is playing?
Whatever is going on here, we would hope that Ares intends to follow up on Tron’s open-ended fate from Legacy. This character deserves redemption after what he was subjected to by CLU. And a Tron sequel needs to include Tron in some capacity.
Perhaps the single most baffling announcement regarding Tron: Ares is the news that Bridges is returning to the franchise. Sure, he’s the most recognizable and bankable star among the Tron: Legacy cast, but there’s the little problem that both of his characters were killed off in that sequel. In the climax of Tron: Legacy, Kevin Flynn sacrifices himself to destroy CLU and give his son and adopted daughter the chance to escape back to the real world.
So why is Bridges of all people back for a third movie? It’s hard to say. We can briefly hear Bridges’ voice in the trailer, but there’s no indication of whether he might be playing a still-living Kevin Flynn or a version of CLU. Did Flynn’s digital archenemy somehow survive their shared death in Legacy? Did Flynn keep a backup of CLU handy? Or has Flynn himself somehow transcended the limits of flesh, achieving immortality in The Grid?
That’s a mystery that will no doubt be solved in Ares. We’ll also find out whether Ares himself is working with Flynn/CLU or carrying out the Master Control Program’s agenda. But whatever the film reveals, there’s no getting around the fact that it’s pretty weird to have a Tron sequel that resurrects Bridges’ character(s) but ignores all the important players who actually survived the events of Legacy. As much as we’re looking forward to Tron: Ares, the sequel also leaves us more than a little perplexed.
But, hey, at least that NIN score is sounding pretty swell.

"The Accountant opens in theaters on Friday, April 25. This review is based on a screening at the 2025 SXSW Film and TV Festival.

You can tell from the way the title is stylized on screen – as a mathematical exponent, likeAlien³– that The Accountant 2 has removed the self-seriousness from its predecessor’s otherwise delightful formula. Gavin O’Connor’s sequel is a blast, building on the story and relationships of 2016’sThe Accountantto reveal a touching, hilarious portrait of fraught brotherhood within a charged and politically relevant plot. All the while, it leans full-tilt into a goofy setup that’s executed with utter confidence: Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck), a.k.a. The Accountant, is a savant number-cruncher for the mob and part-time vigilante gunman whose autism is gently approached and realistically performed, but framed as though it were a superpower.
There’s less bean counting in The Accountant 2, but far more blood and bullets, starting with an opening scene in which former Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (or FinCEN) director Raymond King (J.K. Simmons) is gunned down while working a case in secret. Once the Commissioner Gordon to The Accountant’s Batman – fitting, as Affleck and Simmons have since played that dynamicin the DC Extended Universe– King has only been following leads in which he’s emotionally invested. His death leaves behind an intricate puzzle for Wolff to solve, alongside King’s Treasury Department successor, the returning Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson). The case that got King killed opens up a web of human trafficking between Central America and the southern U.S., exposing the ways in which undocumented immigrants who have little legal recourse are brutally exploited. Where the first film was mostly unsentimental about its central plot (which revolved around a robotics firm), The Accountant 2 conjures immense sympathy with its topical melodrama and the mystery of King’s death.
But as somber as this story seems at first blush, it’s also peppered with wildly amusing moments of character. That begins with Wolff’s re-introduction, during which he games a speed-dating algorithm by sprucing up his profile in all the right ways, only to botch every face-to-face encounter. It’s the perfect kind of silly, placing Wolff’s isolation front and center while setting up his impending reunion with his estranged brother, fellow contract killer Braxton (Jon Bernthal), whose help he seeks to solve King’s murder. Also assisting Wolff is his returning, remote, technologically savvy assistant Justine (Allison Robertson, replacing Allison Wright from the first film), a nonverbal resident of a mansion-like academy for young autistic students. She has her own legion of hackers-in-training this time, à la Professor X – who she even quotes at one point. Like I said: perfectly silly, even if the portrayal of neurodivergence constantly threatens to tip (but never fully does) into offensiveness.
A mysterious, scarily capable assassin known only as Anaïs (Daniella Pineda) seems to somehow be involved in King’s case, but The Accountant 2’s lopsided structure ensures that she disappears for lengthy periods. However, the layers it reveals to her seemingly single-minded character do retroactively justify those absences. After all, this is the kind of movie where no matter how many conveniences cause its jigsaw pieces to click into place, the result is no less entertaining.
Just like The Accountant, whose heightened tone and reliance on tried-and-true storytelling devices – enormous coincidences, long-lost family connections –  wouldn’t feel out of place in a Bollywood movie,the sequel similarly runs a crowd-pleasing gamut. The action is capable and clear. The plot, while complicated in structure, takes the characters to interesting places (both geographically and emotionally). The comedy is fine-tuned and, most importantly, entirely character-and-performance based.
What we said about The Accountant
The Accountant is most engrossing when it focuses on being a character study of this very distinct protagonist. It’s the ultimate actor’s challenge to convey a lot with doing very little and Affleck’s nuanced, tightly coiled performance proves he was up for the task. He also finds the humor in his character and, less surprisingly, excels in the brutal combat scenes. –Jim Vejvoda
Score: 7.3
Read the complete The Accountant Review.
Things simmer on a medium flame until Bernthal shows up and instantly sets the screen ablaze. An actor long compared to Robert De Niro, he finally gets his own “You talkin’ to me?” moment in The Accountant 2, which paves the path for Braxton’s surprising vulnerability – he’s a lost, lonely soul who just wants his older brother’s friendship. Affleck, despite a voice that seems more influenced byThe Simpsons’ Comic Book Guythis time around, returns seamlessly to the role of Wolff. Having retreated almost entirely to the solitude of his tricked-out Airstream trailer, he seems to want to connect as well, but his misreadings of his brother’s body language and intentions make this difficult. Braxton is frank and playful, and Bernthal imbues the character’s body language with an easy-going fluidity, which makes for an enchantingly funny contrast with Wolff’s unwavering stiffness.
The clashes between the brothers are the movie’s heart and soul – this especially comes to light during their downtime from vigilantism (and from Medina’s disapproval of their methods). One scene in an LA square dancing bar is a particular delight, between Braxton’s eagerness to throw hands, and Wolff’s wonderfully roundabout methods of flirtation, which involves him calculating his way onto the dance floor. It’s a sequence that demonstrates O’Connor understanding that movement and character are intrinsically bound, and in action cinema, you can’t really have one without building up the other.
The Accountant 2  is a surprisingly sentimental sequel, which keeps even the most scattered elements of its plot firmly glued together. It’s filled with the kind of unapologetic cheese that Hollywood action has long since replaced with irreverent, quippy snark, ensuring that its humor and drama go hand-in-hand at every turn, resulting in one of the year’s most well-rounded studio pictures.
An immensely entertaining sequel, The Accountant 2 brings back both Ben Affleck’s autistic assassin and his frank, playful, neurotypical brother (played by Jon Bernthal) for a surprising buddy comedy steeped in equally unexpected sentiment. The film is both fun and politically charged, with the sibling duo bickering while pulling on the threads of a murder that reveal a web of human trafficking and cruelty to undocumented immigrants. It’s a bit of everything all at once, and it works like a charm."
"Amazon quietly restocked a bunch ofPokémon TCG bundles just days agoand stock is already running low. These Scarlet & Violet sets have been MIA for weeks, and now they’re back at retail prices. I already added a couple to my cart,Surging SparksBooster Bundle,Shrouded FableETB and Paldean Fates Booster Bundle. Trainers need to snap these up quick. If they’re gone by the time you get there, that’s on you.

Looking for the least expensive PlayStation 5 console you can your hands on? As part of its US Anniversary Sale, AliExpress is offering an importedSony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Editiongaming console for $367.94 shipped after $80 off coupon code ""MAYUE008"". This is a brand new and retail boxed product that is stocked in a US warehouse and qualifies for local delivery, which means it ships free and arrives within about 1-2 weeks.
I also spotted a couple of power banks on sale from INIU and Anker. If you’ve ever watched your phone die mid-flight or mid-text, you know why I’m excited. These things are cheap, fast, and less annoying than asking strangers for a charger at an airport. Do with that information what you will. Oh, and while we’re on the topic of things I absolutely don’t need but definitely want: theGamera: Attack of Legionaction figure is up for preorder at the IGN Store for a cool $560, and Humble Bundle just dropped a massiveDragonlance book bundlethat practically dares you to add 25+ fantasy novels to your backlog for the price of lunch.
I want this bundle purely for the thrill of cracking six packs in a row and pretending I’m building a deck for Worlds. The Surging Sparks expansion is still new enough to feel fresh, and at $45.02, it’s a decent value compared to scalper prices that make you question your financial decisions. If you just want to dip into the latest set without going full collector mode, this is it.
Shiny Pokémon are back, and apparently so is my addiction to them. The Paldean Fates bundle gives you six chances to pull something sparkly, and while $69.94 isn’t exactly pocket change, I think the potential dopamine hit is worth the gamble. It’s in stock, it ships fast, and I’ve made worse choices at 2 a.m. on eBay.
I’m not saying this is the nerdiest thing you can buy today, but it’s definitely on the leaderboard. Humble Bundle just dropped a massive Dragonlance collection; 25+ books for about the cost of lunch. If you’ve ever wanted to get lost in magical twin drama, cursed artifacts, or the politics of dwarves (because who hasn’t), this is your sign. Plus, part of your purchase supports Room to Read, so now your TBR pile can come with good karma.
In my opinion, this is the one to grab if you're all-in on the set. Nine booster packs, a Pecharunt promo, themed sleeves, dice, and an actually-useful storage box? For $54.96? I’ve spent more on less at Taco Bell. Plus, it's still Prime eligible, which means you don’t have to sell your soul for free shipping. Win-win.
This is what happens when you give kaiju collectors exactly what they want: a 9.5-inch figure of LEGION fromGamera 2, complete with flying parts, glowing bits, and articulation that would make Spider-Man jealous. Sure, it’s $560, but I’ve seen statues half as cool go for double that. If you’re the kind of person who rearranges shelf space for something before buying it, I totally get it.
This thing charges your phone like it’s got something to prove. At $26.98, it gives you a full week’s worth of backup power and a built-in flashlight just in case you drop your phone and your dignity under your car seat. I want it purely because it has an LED readout that makes me feel like I’m operating a mission control panel instead of just charging my AirPods.
I think this is the best deal of the day, and not just because it’s $17.99. It’s slim, light, and can survive a drop better than my will to stay off social media. Anker knows what it’s doing, and this charger just works. No random overheating, no mystery ports, just plug it in and keep scrolling through whatever app is currently ruining your sleep schedule.
Hulu + Live TVoffers a three-day free trialthat allows you to take the live TV streaming service for a spin. This is one of the overallbest streaming free trialsbecause it gets you a bundle of services. It is quite a bit shorter than the standard Hulu free trial of 30 days, but it's a great way to test it out over the weekend.
With a 240Hz refresh rate, Dual QHD resolution, and 0.03ms response time, this 49-inch ultrawide OLED is built for high-performance PC gaming. The 1800R curve and HDR True Black 400 make it incredibly immersive, while FreeSync Premium Pro helps keep gameplay smooth and responsive.
This Android tablet comes with an S Pen included, a 10.4-inch display, and Samsung DeX for multitasking. At under $200, it’s a solid pick for casual gamers, students, or anyone who wants a lightweight, entertainment-ready tablet with productivity perks.
Celebrate Women's History Month with a killer bundle featuring female-led games. Titles include Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, Control: Ultimate Edition,Darksiders III,Beyond: Two Souls, and more. It’s a $160+ value for just $12, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity.
With a whopping 10,000Pa of suction, self-refilling, self-emptying, sonic mopping, and even hot-air mop drying, the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra takes hands-off cleaning to the next level. It's packed with AI features and even supports pet tracking and video calls.
Amazon’s newest Kindleadds color to the mix with a 7"" Colorsoft display. It still lasts up to 8 weeks on a single charge and now supports wireless charging and full-color highlights. It's ideal for reading graphic novels, cookbooks, or anything where visuals matter.
Enjoy spatial audio, active noise canceling, and up to 40 hours of battery life. These over-ear headphones are compatible with both iOS and Android, and support lossless audio over USB-C. A strong option for commuters, creators, and music lovers.
This Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code ""IFPRZAZ"" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16"" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.
$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.
I think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.
If you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.
At $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.
$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.
This speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.
Crisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.
This speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.
Bass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.
XM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.
A wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.
My living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.
I didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.
This TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.
I want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.
This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.

"Finding a good deal on Apple products is rough, which is why I focused on all of these daily deals today. Finding multiple Apple deals, plus discounts on Zelda and Final Fantasy collectibles? It's my gamer-tech jackpot. Right now, you can save onAirPods Pro 2, grab aMagSafe leather case for just $11.99, and even score afour-pack of AirTags for under $70.

If you’re in the market forwireless earbuds,power adapters, or anApple Watchband, there are plenty of options at all-time low prices. And you know by now I like to pop in some really cool gaming stuff. How about a full-sizedMaster Sword replicathat plays Zelda music when you swing it and aFinal Fantasy I-VI bundlethat brings the pixel-perfect RPG classics back to life?
Upgrade your tech, complete your Zelda shrine, or relive Final Fantasy’s golden era, these deals are worth checking out. Some discounts like the iPhone 14 Plus MagSafe case, are downright ridiculous at 80% off. But Apple deals never last long (Tim Cook loves that Apple tax), and limited collectibles definitely sell out fast. If something catches your eye, now’s the time to add to cart before the price jumps back up.
AliExpress is offering this Arzopa 15"" 1080p USB Type-C portable monitor for only $57 shipped after you apply coupon code ""IFPQHLH"". We've posted deals on this portable monitor in the past, but this is the lowest price we've seen thus far. The marketplace vendor is Arzopa itself so you're getting the full manufacturer's warranty on this brand new, retail packaged item. This monitor is primarily designed to be a secondary display for a laptop, but the S1's 1080p 60Hz panel is a great match for the Nintendo Switch's hardware, since the Switch only supports up to 720p @ 60Hz anyway.
For only $22 more, you can upgrade to the higher end Arzopa Z1FC USB portable monitor, now only $79.19 after coupon code ""IFPQHLH"". It's currently $117 on Amazon. The Z1FC's upgrades include a larger display (16.1"" vs 15.6""), a higher refresh rate (144Hz vs. 60Hz), and better color reproduction (100% sRGB color gamut). This is a better monitor than the S1 to pair with the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally because both gaming handhelds can support refresh rates up to 144Hz.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience.

At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.

If you’ve ever dreamed of wielding the Master Sword, this Tamashii Nations replica brings that dream to life. At 41.3 inches, it’s a full-sized, collector-worthy version of Link’s legendary blade. It’s not just for display either thanks to authentic sound effects and vibrations activate when you grip and swing it, making you feel like the true Hero of Hyrule.
The hilt features three buttons that play eight iconic songs from Zelda’s history, including themes from Ocarina of Time, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom. The sword comes with a sheath and display stand, so whether you want to show it off or take it into battle (against your furniture), it’s ready.

A genuine Apple leather case for $11.99? That’s not a typo. It’s an 80% discount.

Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.
Why buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend.

Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.
Still using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.
These aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.
These Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.
Luxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.
This isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.
For those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says ""powerful Pokémon"" like an angry robot penguin).
I'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.
If somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.
Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).
If you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, ""I really need to delete some games,"" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.

"Samsung came in strong with today’s deals, and I have to admit, I’m eyeing a couple of them up.The 49-inch Odyssey G9 gaming monitorlooks like something pulled straight from a sci-fi movie.The Galaxy Tab S10+ 5Gis basically a laptop in disguise, and theGalaxy Z Flip 6is making flip phones cool again. If that’s not enough, theS24 Ultrais here to remind every other smartphone who’s boss, and theSSD dealsare giving me a solid excuse to finally clean up my storage situation.

Some of these discounts are impressive, like$500 off that insane QD-OLED monitor. Others, like theSonic statueandRimWorld deal, are more like little bonus treats for the fans. Either way, if you’ve been waiting for a solid sale on a gaming monitor, a high-end phone, or a storage upgrade, Samsung has something worth looking at today.
AliExpress has brand new PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch OLED consoles on sale for prices you won't find anywhere else. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming console that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by youraccount, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item.
I want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.
This phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.
I didn’t know I needed an 11-inch Sonic statue until now. The detail is impressive, the LED lights make it pop, and it’s half off. If you’re a Sonic fan, this is an easy yes. If you’re not, well, now’s a great time to start.
I can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.
RimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.
This SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.
I never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.
I think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.

Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.
Still using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.

They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.
These Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.
Luxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.
This isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.
For those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says ""powerful Pokémon"" like an angry robot penguin).
I'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.
If somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.
Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).
If you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, ""I really need to delete some games,"" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.
Samsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype.

"As March marksWomen’s History Monthin the US, we wanted to highlight the women here at IGN. Last year, we highlighted some staff picks ofgames, movies, and TV. This year we switched gears to another favorite hobby: reading.

When the women of IGN were asked, “Who are your favorite women authors?” – no easy question for avid readers – a fascinating list sprung to life that spanned genres and styles. Let’s see which authors and comic artists were included as we celebrate both the women of IGNandtheir favorite women authors!

Kelly Sue DeConnick has been battling in the trenches of the “boys club” of comics for years. When she wrote for Marvel, she was the one who brought the title of Captain Marvel to Carol Danvers, a legacy brought over into the MCU years later with her name in the credits as a consultant for the films. Outside of the Big Two, she's been an ever-present voice in indie comics with works like Pretty Deadly (if you're looking for a more mystical western theme) and Bitch Planet (if you want a more sci-fi, dystopian, feminist vibe). She continues with her current project, FML, from Dark Horse Comics for those looking for a more supernatural vibe in our stories. If you haven't read anything she's written yet, you're doing yourself a disservice: DeConnick is an incredible writer and an amazing human. –Chelsea Reed
Notable works: Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman Historia, Pretty Deadly, Bitch Planet, FML
Sarah Rose Etter writes weird but clear-eyed books for weird people (like me). Though she’s only published two novels thus far, both have been among my favorite books of the year they came out. The Book of X, about a woman born to generational meat farmers and women with their stomach twisted into a knot, was surreal and painfully relatable; Ripe, about a young woman suffering through her job at a recognizably psychotic San Francisco startup and haunted by an ever-present void, swapped that formula (and also ends not unlike Rose Glass’ film Saint Maud). I hope she writes 100 more books like these in my lifetime. –Leanne Butkovic
Notable works: Ripe, The Book of X
I am excited to see thefilm adaptationof this feminist medieval tale and to see Charli XCX portray Rosa! –Kelly Pham
Notable works: The 100 Nights of Hero
It's unlikely this is the first time you're being recommended N.K. Jemisin's incredible The Broken Earth Trilogy. Though her other fantasy novels deserve attention in their own right, Jemisin's captivating writing, characters, and creative magic system in The Broken Earth Trilogy (specifically in the second book, The Obelisk Gate) make it the easiest to recommend. Her surprising playfulness with storytelling in The Fifth Season may be confusing for some at first, but stick with it – the payoff is fantastic. It follows Essun, a woman trying to hunt down her husband who murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter while trying to survive a recurring cataclysmic event and hide that she has powers to manipulate the very earth around her. It's an incredible, Hugo Award-winning ride. –Miranda Sanchez
Notable works: The Broken Earth Trilogy (The Fifth Season), The City We Became
It's astounding just how much T. Kingfisher publishes in a year but my adventure-loving heart appreciates the number of Kingfisher's consistently interesting retakes on classic fairy tales and horror stories. Kingfisher's stories tend to skew toward gothic horror and dark fantasy, but even still, her comedic pacing and thoughtfully written characters provide a sometimes needed balance for various novels' heavy themes. Whether it's the slow and creeping exploration of emotional abuse in ""What Moves the Dead"" or her exquisite Saint of Steel fantasy romance series that deals with personal identity and loss, I've come away with a full heart (and feeling a little creeped out). –MS
Notable works: Nettle & Bone, What Moves the Dead, Paladin's Grace
Maybe it’s overly obvious to be recommending the most recent Nobel Prize winner for Literature – even members of BTS celebrated her accomplishment on Instagram – but all of the praise lauded on Han Kang is apparent when you crack open one of her novels. Like most people, I was introduced to her work through The Vegetarian when it was translated into English in 2015 and was immediately taken by its disturbingly mesmerizing plot about a housewife who stops eating meat, to the confusion and dismay of those around her, and eventually food altogether. (It’s even more aesthetically arresting knowing that it released in South Korea a full eight years prior.) I’ve followed her ever since, from the thematically similar Greek Lessons to the true-to-life South Korean political atrocities in Human Acts and We Do Not Part, and I cannot implore you enough to read Han Kang. She is a genius andabsolute badass. –LB
Notable works: We Do Not Part, The Vegetarian, Human Acts, Greek Lessons
Newly published but already on her way to releasing a third novel, Yume Kitasei is an imaginative sci-fi writer with a promising career ahead of her. While many of my favorite sci-fi writers tend to have expansive series, Kitasei's one-off stories delightfully build their worlds quickly, and their engaging stories move even faster. Her debut, The Deep Sky, is a neat murder mystery aboard a tech-filled spaceship bound for the hopeful future home of humanity that was hard to put down. Her follow-up, The Stardust Grail, is an Indiana Jones-style adventure as its protagonist races her enemies to find an ancient alien artifact that is the key to her friend's survival but potentially the doom of her own. Both are lovely and imaginative, and I can't wait to read her next novel that's out later this fall. –MS

Perfect for kids just getting started in fantasy. –MF

Sarah J. Mass is a queen in the fantasy romance genre who constantly leaves me jaw-dropped with everything she has created. Her world-building and storytelling are so incredibly detailed, that she quickly became one of my favorite fantasy authors. She’s generally best known for the remarkable series A Court of Thorns and Roses – currently a five-book series with more releases coming – which dives into a story about a young woman who ends up living in a magical realm. In it, she finds her confidence and strength while battling through internal and external wars among the Fae – who are basically humans with super strength, magical powers, and immortality. Her first series was Throne of Glass, an amazing eight-book series that started her fantasy writing and world-building when she was only a teenager. Her latest series, Crescent City, has three books so far, with a fourth to come. All three of her series take place in the fantasy world of the Fae, so when readers are fans of one of her series, they tend to enjoy the others as well. Mass’ ability to develop strong characters and exciting twists leaves her stories equally entwined with the fantastical elements of the story and the romance side of things. For those looking for epic fantasy stories with romance and a bit of spice, jump into the Fae world with these books. –Jessie Wade
Notable works: A Court of Thorns and Roses, Throne of Glass, Crescent City
There seemingly isn't a genre Silvia Moreno-Garcia won't tackle. Whether it's a historical romance with a touch of fantasy in The Beautiful Ones or a dark vampire adventure set in Mexico City in Certain Dark Things, Moreno-Garcia nails it every time. Some of her romance-forward stories feel a little similar in their dynamics if you read them back to back, but it's easy to make sure that doesn't happen if you're new to her small library of published works. The majority of her works tend to skew toward dark historical fantasy set throughout North America – and, more often than not, in Mexico, which is wonderfully refreshing. Anything she publishes has a guaranteed spot on my limited bookshelf space. –MS
Notable works: Mexican Gothic, Gods of Jade and Shadow, Silver Nitrate
Erin Morganstern's two novels, The Night Circus and The Starless Sea, read like falling into a dream. Morganstern is another of the very few authors whose books I will not only buy in hardcover instantly but also grab multiple copies to collect the various editions. The Night Circus is a luscious, historical fantasy romance about two magicians trained since childhood for their inevitable battle against one another at a mysterious circus. It's guaranteed to break me out of a reading slump whenever I pick it up again and was the book that drew me back into regularly reading as an adult. (Sometimes you've gotta not look at a screen, as much as I love spending my time playing video games.)  Her second novel, The Starless Sea, is a winding, enchanting story about stories. It begins in the world we know before protagonist Zachary finds his way into an underground realm that serves as the library of all stories and it's in danger. Like her debut, The Starless Sea is wonderfully written and best paired with a warm cup of tea. –MS
Notable works: The Night Circus, The Starless Sea
I get a little giddy when I hear that a new Helen Oyeyemi book is on its way. A truly singular voice, Oyeyemi is hard to pin down in a way that’s like – stick with me here – trying to chase down a wispy ghost that’s purposefully messing with you but you’re still having a great time anyway. Her novels are fantastical, but aren’t really fantasy at all; a chunk of them are inspired by Hans Christian Anderson folktales, but the look and feel could not be further from their progenitors. (Gingerbread, for example, is vaguely Hansel and Gretel-ish put through a capitalist meat grinder.) Mostly they’re all fever dream adventures that nuke the rules of literary fiction. As another great writer Alexandra Kleemansaid to The Nation, Oyeyemi’s work has “the discombobulating quality of walking through a moving vehicle while carrying a full-to-the-brim cup of very hot tea.” –LB
Notable works: Parasol Against the Axe, Gingerbread, Boy Snow Bird, Mr. Fox
Tummy Bugs is a collection of over a decade of work from Leomi Sadler and full of bright colors and dark humor. –KP

For those of you who have been mourning the end of the Game of Thrones TV show and are waiting rather impatiently for George R.R. Martin to finally publish The Winds of Winter, Samantha Shannon is here to ease your suffering. The Roots of Chaos series, starting with The Priory of the Orange Tree, is exactly the kind of high fantasy series we all deserve. With rich characters, dragons, magic, suspense, tragedy, and a satisfying twist, this 845-page book will keep you on the edge of your seat and immersed in another world for as long as you let it. Another prequel, A Day of Fallen Night, was published only three years later, but excitement continues with yet another prequel, Among the Burning Flowers, which will be coming out later this year. If you've been itching to start a new series, this is the perfect time to jump in. –CR
Notable works: The Roots of Chaos series (The Priory of the Orange Tree), The Bone Season series
Gail has been writing comics (and other media) for a long time and has done amazing work in portraying the quiet but no less powerful moments in superheroes’ lives. She has won GLAAD awards and is the first female solo writer for Uncanny X-Men. She is more amazing than a short blurb can say. Check her out! –MF
Notable works: Uncanny X-Men. You can pre-order the next release (August 5) onAmazonnow.
Sue Lynn Tan's debut, Daughter of the Moon Goddess, is a gorgeous reimagining and expansion of the Chinese legend of the moon goddess and continues with its follow-up, Heart of the Sun Warrior. Together, they are the most delicious romantic adventures I've read. The duology eloquently gives context to Chinese mythology for those unfamiliar with it while keeping the pace of the action steady. As the first book's title suggests, the hidden daughter of the exiled moon goddess, Xingyin, takes the role of protagonist when she's sent into hiding among the Celestial Kingdom while her mother must continue her imprisonment on the moon. Determined to set her mother free, Xingyin goes on an epic, inspiring adventure to set things right. Tan's complex characters and strong understanding of romantic pacing make these instant standouts among romantic fantasy novels. –MS
Notable works: The Celestial Kingdom Duology (Daughter of the Moon Goddess), Immortal

Written for young adults, Jacqueline Wilson's works touch on hard-to-talk-about topics such as grief and loss, substance abuse, bullying, and abandonment. I grew up reading Wilson's books, and could often relate to her characters due to my own tough upbringing. I would often escape to my local library and bury myself in one of her books to feel less alone in what I was going through. She has won several awards for her work, including a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (basically the best award you can get!) by King Charles III for her ""services to Literature."" –Meg Koepp
Notable works: ""Girls"" series, Think Again, The Illustrated Mum
Rebecca Yarros’sEmpyrean seriesis a striking adult fantasy romance that follows a young woman’s experience going to a war college for dragon riders. If you can imagine humans working with dragons to prepare for war, you can guess (correctly) that it’s brutal right off the bat. Even though violence takes a prominent, integral role in the books, it doesn’t overtake the importance of the storyline itself, the characters, and the world-building. Yarros does a phenomenal job creating relatable characters who deal with serious challenges, both physical and mental, they need to learn to overcome, but there’s a theme of friendship and support throughout. The romance is woven into the story in an organic way that complements the plot well, while still keeping the excitement in the fantasy world. Even for those not interested in the romance side of it, you’ll likely end up adoring the characters’ experiences together and crave more of it the further you read. Yarros has this ability to create such complex storylines with so many unexpected twists and turns, leaving you constantly hyped. She reveals more of her worlds as she goes on through the books, and when I say she’ll crush your world and then rebuild it (hopefully), I mean it. You’ll be surprised how attached you get to dragons and think of them as real people. The Empyrean series is a five-book series and the third book was released on January 21, 2025, with two still to come. –JW
Notable works: Empyrean Series (Fourth Wing, Iron Flame, and Onyx Storm)

"Part of the magic of John Carpenter’s legendary 1982 sci-fi horror filmThe Thingis that the ending is left ambiguous. For the past 43 years, fans have wondered whether R.J. MacReady, played by Kurt Russell, or Childs, played by Keith David, turns into the movie’s central monster at the end, but Carpenter intentionally left fans guessing with absolutely no clues to how things shook down — until now.

The master of horror revealed to Parasite and Mickey 17 director Bong Joon Ho at a special 4K screening of The Thing at the David Geffen Theater in Los Angeles on March 22 thatthere is a “giant hint”in the middle of the film reveals who eventually turns into The Thing at the end of the film. He went on to joke that he would reveal that coveted knowledge to anyone who sent an undisclosed sum of money “in an envelope to my house.”
Carpenter also told the crowd that the actors themselves didn’t even know who would ultimately end up becoming The Thing. “They had no clue,” he admitted. “But they had to play it human, you see. The creature imitates perfectly. It could be one of us, it could be somebody in the audience, and there’s no way of telling. So I knew, they didn’t know.”
As for the hint itself, indie director Joe Russo (notMCU favorite Joe Russo) unleashed his theory on the world via X / Twitter following the screening. “I think I found that hint,”Russo wrote.
Russo noted that MacReady is told about the notion that the creature can replicate at the cellular level, which means that, for their safety, they should only be eating or drinking things that they alone have had contact with. Despite knowing this crucial detail, MacReady shares his liquor with Childs at the end of the film. This could potentially mean MacReady just forgot what he was told, but in Russo’s theory it more likely means he is, in fact, The Thing. ""As soon as Childs drinks from the bottle, The Thing has won,” Russo says. “It’s beaten its most skeptical, final threat.”
Of course, the brilliance of Carpenter’s film is that it ends before any of that is confirmed. But Russo offered further supporting evidence. He noted the last line of the film — ""Why don't we just wait here for a little while, see what happens?"" — is very apropos to the situation if MacReady has already become The Thing. The filmmaker’s thread also has an explanation for the moment we see MacReady kill The Thing: “[Did you see that] OR… did you watch a BETTER imitation kill a POORER imitation because it had a better chance of infiltrating society upon rescue.""
Some fans were definitely swayed by the theory, while others were stuck on the notion that Childs is the one who becomes the creature. ""I still think it’s Childs because we don’t know his whereabouts for a long time heading into the final scene. But Keith David will tell you he’s 100% not The Thing,""one fan added to the thread. Russo replied: ""Carpenter said both actors don't know... Childs always felt like a red herring to me.""
Either way, it’s definitely a theory worth considering. Carpenter still manages to surprise and delight fans all these years later, and we’re lucky to still be getting bits and pieces of his wisdom.

"High hopes, high hopes, Paul Walter Hauser is giving us high hopes.The Fantastic Four: First Stepsis on the horizon, and Hauser is hyping up the movie with some extremely choice words that, if proven correct, might mean this is one of the best MCU films in recent years.

""So I think our movie, Fantastic Four: First Steps, to me, only speaking from my opinion, everything I witnessed and took part in, everything I felt while in the presence of the creatives on the film, I believe we are the Marvel movie of the year,” Hauser, who isplaying a still-undisclosed role in the film, toldTheDirectin a recent interview. “I believe we are the one to watch.""
Hauser, who is starring in the upcoming filmThe Luckiest Man In America, even went as far as to compare the film to two of the most highly regarded MCU outputs ever. ""And I believe that this will go down in history as one of the ones that started a new tide of successful storytelling for the company,” he added. “Sort of in the same way theGuardians of the GalaxyandBlack Pantherhit. They both hit in a certain way. I believe we are about to hit.""
That said, the Richard Jewell actor also noted that, you know, if itdoesend up being bad, everyone has bad days — I mean, movies. ""Let's remember thatMarvel is servicing a lot of folks, and they want to make a lot of entertainment for people to enjoy, and none of us are 100%. None of us hit the mark every time,” Hauser said. “Not a single one of us. Your favorite director has made a less than satisfactory movie. Just facts.""
The Fantastic Four: First Steps went into development shortly after Josh Trank’s 2015 attempt at a reboot film wasless than the big bang 20th Century Fox was hoping for. After Disney acquired Fox in 2019, the movie was moved to Marvel Studios and officially announced in July of that year. Matt Shakman replaced Jon Watts as director in September 2022, and will helm a script by Josh Friedman, Cameron Squires, Eric Pearson, Peter Cameron, Jeff Kaplan, and Ian Springer.
Vanessa Kirby, Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bacarach are set to start as the titular four, with a supporting cast of Hauser, John Malkovitch, Julia Garner, Natasha Lyonne, Sarah Niles, and Ralph Ineson as the villain Galactus alongside them.
PotentialAI postersaside, The Fantastic Four: First Steps will usher in Phase Six of the MCU and is set to be released in theaters on July 25, 2025. We also knowThe Fantastic Four will turn up in the next Avengers movie, Avengers: Doomsday, now that the cast has been revealed.

"There’s no denying the Russo Brothers’ new Netflix filmThe Electric Statehas been the talk of the town since it debuted on Friday — and with the industry’s climate the way it is, fans have certainly been discussing itsuse of AI.

That said, Joe Russo, who alongside his brother Anthony directed Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, has defended the use of AI for voice modulation in The Electric State, claiming it was “something any 10-year-old could do after watching a TikTok video.”
""There’s a lot of finger-pointing and hyperbole because people are afraid,” Joe Russo insisted in an interview withThe Times. “They don’t understand. But ultimately you’ll see AI used more significantly.""
The filmmaker added that he sees potential in the technology. ""Also, AI is in its generative state now, where it has, as we call them, hallucinations. You can’t do mission-critical work with something that hallucinates,” Russo said. “That is a reason self-driving cars haven’t taken over, or why AI surgery is not taking place worldwide. But in its generative state, AI is best suited towards creativity.""
While many artists across a whole host of disciplines feel AI is actually the antithesis of creativity, it seems as though some of the studios are excited to use the tech when it’s ready to be implemented. Back in July 2024, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos claimed thataudiences “don’t care” if AI is used in the film and television programming they watch. Sarandos doubled down and asserted that the tech is ""a great way for creators to tell better stories.""
""Animation didn't get cheaper, it got better in the move from hand-drawn to CG animation, and more people work in animation today than ever in history,"" Sarandos said on the call. ""So I'm pretty sure there's a better business and a bigger business in making content 10% better than there is in making it 50% cheaper.""
For what it’s worth, not everyone seems to be embracing AI right off the bat. Last month,Marvel denied using AIto create teaser posters for the upcomingThe Fantastic Four: First Steps, despite one of the people in the imagery sporting a four-fingered hand.
The Electric State was directed and produced by Anthony and Joe Russo from a script by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, which was loosely adapted from a 2018 illustrated novel by Simon Stalenhag. The movie stars Millie Bobby Brown, Chris Pratt, Ke Huy Quan, Woody Harrelson, Jason Alexander, Anthony Mackie, Jenny Slate, Giancarlo Esposito, Brian Cox, and Stanley Tucci.
IGN'sThe Electric State reviewreturned a 4/10. We said: ""Marvel’s biggest hitmakers join forces again with the Netflix algorithm to deliver The Electric State, a $300-million anti-event movie.""
The Russo Brothers are down to direct the next two Avengers movies for Marvel Studios: 2026's Avengers: Doomsday and 2027's Avengers: Secret Wars.

"UPDATE March 27 2025:Paramount Pictures confirmed Steven Yeun's involvement in the Aang Avatar movie with IGN via email. A spokesperson for the company also clarified that the film remains untitled despite rumors that it was in development with the name Aang: The Last Airbender.

ORIGINAL STORY March 27 2025:Invincible and The Walking Dead star Steven Yeun has reportedly joinedthe upcoming animated Aang Avatar movie.
Details on Yeun’s involvement come fromVariety, which reports the versatile star has been picked up to be a part of the film’s cast in an undisclosed role. It means we could hear him lend his voice acting talents as a new character from any one of the project’s Earth, Air, Fire, and Water kingdoms. There’s also the chance we see him play a familiar character, too, though the animated film's plot details also remain tightly under wraps.
Variety's report also states the Aang Avatar movie is currently ""untitled"" after previously being referred to as Aang: The Last Airbender. It's unclear if that title idea has been dropped by Paramount Pictures.
Yeun made a name for himself as The Walking Dead’s baseball cap-wearing Glen before eventually branching out to appear in shows likeNetflix’s award-winning Beefas well as movies like Nope and, more recently, Mickey 17. He’s also managed to cement himself as a more-than-capable voice actor, too. Amazon Prime Video’s Invincible, where he leads as the superhero series’ titular character, is no doubt his most notable voice acting credit, but he’s also got an important history with the Avatar universe.
Sequel series The Legend of Korra spends a good chunk of Book Two, its second season, diving into Yeun's character, Wan. A long-deceased man with deep ties to the spirit world – and the very first Avatar – Wan is undoubtedly an important name in Avatar canon. It would make sense to see Aang: The Last Airbender explore its lead’s relationship with the first master of all four elements. Then again, Yeun could surely make sense in a new role, too.
IGN has reached out to Paramount for comment.
Choosing how The Walking Dead alum fits into the 2026 film is up to co-directors Lauren Montgomery and William Mata. The duo is already hard at work alongside original creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, who remain attached as executive producers. The project is part ofa trilogy of animated worksfrom the Avatar team.
Aang: The Last Airbender, the first of the three films, is scheduled topremiere January 30, 2026. It will starsinger/songwriter Eric Nam as the titular Airbender, with Guardians of the Galaxy and Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery star Dave Bautista also apart of its cast.
With less than a year to go before its planned release date, we’ll surely hear more about how its story will expand upon the beloved universe in the coming months. For more on all things Avatar, you can read up onhow Netflix will continue its live-action take on the original series.

"At CinemaCon in Las Vegas, Amazon MGM gave attendees a first look at what to expect from next year’s new Masters of the Universe film - and what they showed was very promising.

With the film only recently beginning production, no actual completed footage was shown, but rather a message from set from director Travis Knight (Kubo and the Two Strings, Bumblebee) and stars Nicholas Galitzine (“He-Man”) and Camila Mendes (“Teela”), followed by a montage of behind-the-scenes/on-set footage mixed with production artwork.
Knight noted he grew up a huge Masters of the Universe fan, which feels apparent seeing the designs for the film, which are incredibly accurate to the original toy line and animated series from the 1980s - much like what Knight did in Bumblebee with the Transformers. Production artwork of characters like the Sorceress (Morena Baccarin) and Evil-Lyn (Alison Brie) looked right out of the source material and were instantly recognizable.
Some of the characters actually shown on set in the midst of production included Trap Jaw (Sam C. Wilson) and Tri-Klops (Kojo Attah), and it was amazing how much they truly looked like the original toys in a slightly more modernized form, with someone like Trap Jaw still retaining all of his recognizable elements, including his gun arm, blue body and green face - and yes, a trap jaw! It appears Knight has managed the delicate balancing act of keeping these bigger than life characters looking wild and cool, without feeling too goofy in live-action form.
Brief on set footage of Jared Leto as Skeletor kept him in the shadows, but production art and glimpses of makeup being applied indicate he will likely also be sporting the character’s blue skin from the toy line, unlike the version in the 1987 Masters of the Universe movie.
Galitzine looked appropriately buff and blond to play He-Man, having gained a lot of muscle mass from how he looked in movies like Red, White & Royal Blue and Bottoms, and we saw glimpses of the weight and fight training he’s gone through for the film - and got a look at He-Man’s iconic Power Sword, looking appropriately intimidating. We also saw Mendes getting in some stunt work, including running along a wall with the aid of a harness.
The only thing that felt odd, given He-Man’s typical fictional background, were moments on set showing Adam, He-Man’s alter-ego, in what looked like an American suburban bedroom. The 1987 film notably saved money by having most of the story involve He-Man transported to Earth, but it feels very unlikely that will occur again here, as we saw huge sets had been built for Eternia in the footage. But is there some sort of set-up with Adam mistakenly believing he’s an Earthling initially for some reason? That might explain the role Agatha All Along’s Sasheer Zamata is playing, a character with the very normal-sounding name “Suzie,” who has been described as Adam’s best friend.
Time will tell, with Masters of the Universe set to open June 5, 2026."
"The James Bond rumor mill continues followingthe shock news that Amazon had taken full creative control over 007, and we’re no closer to knowing who will play the famous spy in whatever’s next.

However, according to a new report, James Bond will remain a man and still be British or from the Commonwealth. TheMail on Sundaysaid that Amazon circulated an internal memo stipulating James Bond would not change gender or nationality under its tenure.
That’s sure to please Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, who played Bond in GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, and Die Another Day from 1995 to 2002. Speaking toThe Telegraph, Brosnan said ‘it’s a given’ that 007 should be British.
However, if an actor from the Commonwealth is possible, that leaves the door open to Australian Chris Hemsworth, who has expressed his interest in playing the character in the past. In 2019, the Thor and Extraction star toldBalancemagazine, after the publication pointed out his performance as British Formula One driver James Hunt made him a perfect candidate: “When we were shooting Rush someone had said that and I thought, ‘Cool, if this is my audition tape, then great.’ I don’t think you’ll ever meet anyone who doesn’t want to have a crack at James Bond. I’d love to do it.
“But that’s up to so many elements and is way beyond myself; it’s not one you can pitch yourself on to either. It’s something that the community of Bond fans, Barbara Broccoli and the whole crew there agree on, and it has to be a very organic decision from them. There have been a lot of names thrown out there and a lot of brilliant people can tackle that one.”
Hemsworth's comments have now resurfaced following the Mail on Sunday's report and word that a man from the Commonwealth could play Bond. TheToday Show Australiatook the speculation and declared: ""It's a surety. He is in.""
There is a degree of concern about the future of James Bond following Amazon’s acquisition and the stepping back of long-term 007 producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson.
Amid speculation that Amazon may decide to go with a Bond TV series,Varietyreported that a new Bond film is still the “top priority.” As for what’s next, Amazon will allegedly first look for a producer for the franchise. Apparently David Heyman, who shepherded the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films with a cohesive vision, is the kind of producer Amazon is looking for.
Christopher Nolan reportedly “expressed interest” in directing a Bond movieafterTenet, but Broccoli allegedly insisted no director would have “final cut” while she was in charge of the franchise and turned him down. Nolan went on to makeOppenheimer, which made nearly $1 billion at the global box office and won the best picture and best director (Nolan) Oscars.
Amazon’s control over Bond hasn’t gone down well with some.LonglegsandThe Monkeydirector was asked during a recent Reddit AMA whether he’d be op-en to directing a Bond movie, andhis answerwas loud and clear: “No, because f**k Jeff Bezos.”
Fans are particularly keen to know who will play Bond next. While some are calling for the likes of Venom star Tom Hardy, the MCU's Idris Elba, Professor X actor James McAvoy, Magneto actor Michael Fassbender, and Kraven’s Aaron Taylor-Johnson (who was previously rumored to be top of the list),the clear fan-favorite is Superman and The Witcher star Henry Cavill.
According to Variety, Amazon is unable to hire anyone on Bond until the closure of its Broccoli-Wilson deal, which is expected at some point this year. The news followed an explosive report that alleged the future of the James Bond franchise was “on pause” amid what was described as an “ugly” stalemate between the Broccoli family and Amazon.
The behind-the-scenes battle between Barbara Broccoli, who had retained creative control over Bond and decided who played the iconic British spy, and Amazon, which acquired the right to release Bond movies afterit bought Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in a deal worth $8.45 billion back in 2021, had left Bond “trapped,” theWall Street Journalreported.
Amazon and Eon have yet to issue a comment.

"A Minecraft Moviehad a massive opening weekend at the box office and sparked pandemonium inside theaters, with popcorn being thrown, wild ""CHICKEN JOCKEY!"" screams, and even reports of police being called. But some are saying their experience was ruined by the chaos.

Social media was flooded with videos showing overly enthusiastic cinemagoers screaming lines from the movie, openly filming with their phones, throwing popcorn, and clapping rowdily.
One phrase in particular has risen to the top of the social media pile: ""CHICKEN JOCKEY!"" Jack Black, who plays Minecraft's famous playable character, Steve, says the line in the movie, and videos of screenings that took place over the weekend show it is sending teens delirious.
The line is said during a scene in which Black and Jason Momoa face a cuboid Minecraft chicken who is ridden by a baby zombie in a boxing ring. Black’s Steve declares ""CHICKEN JOCKEY!"" after the baby zombie falls from a crate onto the chicken; a reference to the video game itself, where certain baby zombie characters are sometimes found riding a chicken.
Given these fans had already seen thechicken jockeyscene via a Minecraft trailer released in February, they were primed for release when they saw the movie in the cinema. And now, the chicken jockey line has taken on a life of its own, going viral on social media which in turn is fueling even more intense reaction.
the minecraft movie is truly one of the worst movies i’ve ever seen but the universal reaction to “chicken jockey” im seeing made it all worth it.pic.twitter.com/0mxgliSYEp
One person who filmed the reaction, X / Twitter user @ollie_twt, described the scenes: ""the people behind me took their shirts off as well as the ones in the front that were standing. That was by far the loudest theater I’ve ever been in and it was awesome.""
Happened to overhear a Chicken Jockey momentpic.twitter.com/TUvwMqrZRq
One TikTok video viewed by IGN shows a person carrying another on their shoulders, mimicking the chicken jockey itself. Another video, below, shows a teen standing ready to throw two popcorn buckets' worth of popcorn over the audience during the chicken jockey scene.
Another shows similar popcorn-throwing scenes:
There are even reports of police being called to eject members of the audience, and complaints from theater employees who have taken to social media and online forums to say people throwing drinks and popcorn makes their jobs even harder.
While it’s clear a significant portion of the Minecraft movie audience is loving all the chaos, there are a number of fans who have expressed frustration that their experience was ruined by all the shouting and clapping.
I need to know, are there people who actually enjoy watching a movie like this?pic.twitter.com/v9NSSe0sqd
Then there are the bemused audience members who aren't in on the joke. Parents taking their young children, friends and family members who aren't as... online as the rest of us.
Warner Bros. will no doubt be delighted by the virality of A Minecraft Movie, of course, as it heads into its second weekend.It’s already secured an incredible $301 million during opening weekend. Could it eventually beat The super Mario Bros. Movie as the highest-grossing video game adaptation of all time?

"It’s wild that it took almost 20 years and dozens of games for the biggest stealth action series around to finally bend towards feudal Japan. Assassin's Creed Shadows makes the most of that theme, with a great pair of shinobi and samurai heroes sharing center stage that are well-written and fun to skulk through giant castles or wade into vicious battles with. Besides the setting, the bulk of the changes this time focus on making smaller tweaks to well-established systems, such as less cluttered maps and skill trees, while also doubling down on things that really worked in 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage, like the more focused and tougher combat that accompanies its better paced main quests. It’s not a perfect reset, as imbalances and missed opportunities abound, but I feel more confident than ever that Assassin’s Creed could be back and here to stay.

Like a river in the rainy season, Shadows’ story overflows with cliches that are signature to fiction set in this era. Warriors wander the land to bring honor to themselves and their masters. Absent rulers let wealthy bureaucrats exploit the poor. Bandits hold the countryside in the cold grip of fear. If you’re a fan of James Clavell’s Shogun or the excellent movies of Akira Kurosawa, you have certainly seen the bulk of what protagonists Yasuke and Naoe are made to navigate. This isn’t a bad thing, and morally complex intersecting plots still keep the intrigue high, which is the same trick that made Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s stories work when they did. I don’t think I was particularly wowed by the writing on a regular basis, but there are some standout moments of tense reflection and curious happenings sprinkled throughout. The typical Assassin’s Creed conspiracy woven into it fits perfectly within the war torn Sengoku period of Japan, too, like a hidden blade snugly in its wrist sheath.
The leads themselves are wonderful. You spend a lot of the early game with the sharp-witted and broody Naoe, who is among the last shinobi warriors of the Iga clan, a role thrust upon her by tragedy. That tragedy befell her in part by the hands of the charismatic hulk Yasuke, who is a tireless warrior for justice and peace. When they begin working together, they are frequently each other’s most reliable consul, with sound and often different perspectives on the events going on around them. In other words, they truly do balance one another, and while I don’t think either one would win popularity contests against other series stars like Ezio or Edward, together they serve as the bright light in the center of a largely dark tale of revenge.
The story overall is paced similarly to Valhalla, where the cardinal reason to be in each of the nine regions of the map is to play through a mostly self-contained chapter. That said, Shadows does a better job of making sure at least some story elements and characters don’t just completely vanish when you leave a region the way they did in its predecessor. Not every new lord or business man you meet becomes completely irrelevant after you’ve solved their problems. I also found these sections, and the overall time it took to move from chapter to chapter, to be more brisk and less filled with frustrating filler than past games. It’s still a bit too full of “go here, do that” as bridges between major moments than I’d prefer, but it's organized in a way that can be enjoyed in pieces and at your leisure without getting too lost between plot points, almost like how one might read a good book.
Most of the missions in Shadows start on the objective board, a bigger and more elaborate chart of people that need assistance and targets that need eliminating adapted from Assassin’s Creed Mirage. Thematically, this approach matches the tone of using all the information you gather to identify hidden members of the secret society trying to plunge Japan into chaos. Functionally, the way it organizes outstanding tasks and the people involved is far more useful than the old bulleted quest lists. It does trade some of the magic of exploration away as a cost of this efficacy, though. More than once I organically stumbled across a jerk that couldn’t be talked down, just to kill them and find not only his crossed out profile tacked to my board, but also the exact number of remaining silhouettes of the gang I had no idea they were a part of until right then. But it’s a trade I would make every time.
Selecting a quest gave me a short list of clues to help discern where the objective was, which is easier to figure out depending on how well I’d searched that part of the map already. Past games have given hints to identify targets like this before, hoping to create some friction between you and the effort to find your quarry, but Shadows is the first one that I felt constantly made me look at my map and actually deduce where the spot in question might be by using those clues and some educated guesses. I could use scouts, one of the assets you can develop at your hideout, to assist in the narrowing process, pinging an area on the map and highlighting unidentified objectives in the zone. This doesn't reveal hidden locations or features of the map outside of just a marker though, so it's a bad way to clear fog of war from a distance. It will also cost one scout whether they find something or not, and scouts are replenished in very few ways, so scouting can be a real risk if you’re trying to make progress in the main story – especially early on.
Rather than lighting up your map with a galaxy of tooltips, Shadows mostly relies on sparse point-of-interest icons to push you towards the areas you’ll need to see the finer details of in-person. Even when you climb up to the signature highpoints to take a good long look at your surroundings, what you’ll see is a bevy of nondescript icons that tell you thatsomethingis out there, but you’re gonna have to hop down from that perch and go check them out for yourself to know what. I love this – I could feel my brain starting to detangle the checklist conditioning that years of these games had instilled in me. Not only did I feel compelled to just ride through the countryside and genuinely explore stuff without much expectation of grand rewards, I also felt no nagging compulsion to check off every possible thing to do in a region inorganically.
Most of these undiscovered locations fall into one of a number of reliable categories, like castles you can infiltrate and attempt to steal special gear from or any of the many villages scattered across Japan, but you can’t be sure unless you take it in for yourself. A common thing I would always stop to handle whenever I came across them were world activities – these are smaller locations and events that, when completed, add knowledge points to your characters, increasing their knowledge levels and adding new options to their skill trees. Not all of these events are exciting, with running around temples to find missing scroll pages being my least favorite, but they often don’t take too long and the points are worth it in the end. And in the case of something like the horse archery challenges, they can add an interesting distraction from the action for a short spell.
Between outings, I spent some time at the hideout, this iteration of Valhalla’s Ravensthorpe settlement. After collecting minerals, crops, and wood out in the world, you can use those resources to build and upgrade important buildings here that give you access to new assets. I spent the majority of my time at the forge managing my equipment, while other important buildings provide more passive additions or have features that can be managed in places outside of the hideout, like the new summoning ability from the dojo which let me call in help from certain allies I met during my adventure. I’m glad I didn’t have to dote on this place very much as I personally can’t be bothered to decorate a homestead, but for those interested in that sort of thing I was absolutely flooded by the cosmetics I unlocked just in the natural course of completing tasks and looting, so you’ll never be starved for options to spice the place up.
Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s return to the stealthy style that launched this series doesn’t do everything right, but everything it does feels like it was done with purpose. This means a shorter game with a smaller map, fewer collectibles, smaller scope in combat, and a limited selection of gear to play with – all of which I found refreshing relative to the arguably bloated scale of 100-hour games like Odyssey and Valhalla. It also means an overly simplistic plot with mostly forgettable characters, but what the story lacks in depth it makes up for with its straightforward quest progression and fast pacing. Though there's no big standout “wow” moment, Baghdad is a beautiful location in its own right, and the world’s detail is focused inward, making every alley and hovel feel well traveled and full of detail and history. I’d recommend Mirage to anyone who’s lapsed on Assassin’s Creed, as its back-to-basics approach is a successful first step in returning the feeling that the earlier industry-defining games gave me so long ago.– Jarrett Green, October 4, 2023
Read the fullAssassin's Creed Mirage review
The real sightseeing, though, is out in the world. 1500s Japan is a beautiful place – there’s such a symphony of color over every hill and across every lake. Each season brings with it incredible landscapes, sometimes covered in the reddish brown of Autumn or entombed in deep white snow. In fact, I found the weather to be some of the best I’d ever experienced in an open world. It was hard not to be moved watching powerful winds pick up and bring in rolling thunderstorms, especially when watching how nature reacted to it all in real time, as flocks of birds took flight and ground critters scurry around to find safety. And not for nothing, but in my dozens of hours in Shadows I encountered remarkably few bugs for a game this size.
The main 40-hour story revolves around the dual protagonists attempting to unmask and eliminate members of a deadly organization called the Shinbakufu. Once you’ve chosen a target, the multi-mission arcs give you regular opportunities to handle a situation with either Yasuke’s might or Naoe’s stealth. However, while there are certainly scenarios where one is more useful than the other, in general, there are remarkably few quests where Naoe isn’t better suited for the task at hand. This comes down to how their abilities are divided between them. If the classic Assassin’s Creed playstyle is the combination of exploration, parkour, stealth, and combat, Naoe can do all of these competently and excels at parkour and stealth. Yasuke, meanwhile, can’t climb very well or sneak around much due to his size and general lack of grace. He is a devastating force in combat – maybe the most overbearing and dominant protagonist in the series – but Naoe can simply sneak around most situations that Yasuke would cut his way through, solving them with so much less trouble if done well. As much as I like Yasuke, he’s far more limited and one dimensional in his style, with large parts of this game not quite designed to take advantage of his strengths in a way that feels intentional.
It's particularly disappointing because Shadows does find ways to tailor missions around both of their skills on occasion, usually in bigger, more pivotal and important battles where both heroes need to operate together to succeed. These special missions are separated into sections that allow you to choose which character to proceed with, changing what’s asked of you depending on your choice. In a later game mission, Naoe is securing the perimeter of the castle walls, taking out gunmen, while Yasuke storms the place demanding to challenge this chapter’s foe to a duel for the lives of his hostages. Depending on who you play as, you’re either weaving through blockades to drop specific soldiers without alerting the whole castle, or you’re having a fierce duel against a powerful samurai. It's awesome, and made the more homogenous space between these moments a real bummer.
Combat overall is more challenging than in the past. Enemies, especially in groups, are more aggressive, relying on combos and unblockable attacks as often as possible. They also tend to have solid defenses, both in that they block a lot and also in that many of them are armored, essentially giving them a second life bar. Effectively taking them down means having a solid defense of your own, dodging and deflecting their blows to make them vulnerable, and taking advantage before they recover. It requires a more thoughtful execution of your various abilities than previous games have, and I never felt like combat was a chore in and of itself – though the camera really struggled to keep all of the action in frame, and doubly so when inside buildings.
Straightforward combat really sings when playing as Yasuke, whose set of swords, naginata, kanabo, bows, and even guns are all perfect for decimating enemies. He is a juggernaut of a man outside of his toys, being able to literally run through walls and shake the earth with his blows. He’s also tough and can take many more blows before succumbing to his wounds. Naoe is very fragile by comparison, and while capable of doing lots of damage when enemies are vulnerable, she struggles to stagger them without the help of her tools. She gets overwhelmed easily by mobs, especially well-armored bruisers, and when the numbers get above three or four foes, I almost always found it better to drop a smoke bomb and disappear versus attempting to fight them all in an open melee.
On the flipside, Naoe is a menace when striking from the shadows or catching enemies unaware. This Assassin’s Creed takes the “Shadows” in its name seriously, with darkness being a key part of her stealth gameplan. There are some new features that help her out, like being able to crawl and dodge while prone, as well as some returning ones like her Eagle Sense, which lets you see silhouettes of enemies through walls. The long-missing double assassination is back too, and all of these add up to make Naoe one of the most robust assassins in the series. Yasuke can’t hold a candle to his ninja counterpart in this arena.
Enhancing your combat abilities is mercifully less tedious than Valhalla’s skill constellation. Naoe and Yasuke have skill trees focused on their weapons and specialities, with every node feeling far more impactful than simple passive damage bonuses (which still exist, but in small amounts). Gaining new abilities is obviously the most impactful, but some of the real hidden gems add new functionality to weapons, like being able to turn certain attacks with Naoe’s chain sickle into grapples that let you pull enemies into obstacles or off of cliffs. Yasuke and his abundance of weapons made for some skill trees I largely ignored, especially his bow and teppo, as he is such a close ranged juggernaut that I had a hard time justifying spending my admittedly plentiful skill points on a ranged strategy I never embraced.
Speaking of excess, Shadows takes a big step backward from the work done around your inventory in Valhalla and Mirage. There are far too many pieces of randomized, color-tiered gear to pick up from fallen foes or as forgettable quest rewards that have no chance of making it into my rotation. Base stats like damage might make them relevant as last-minute stop gaps to keep your stats in line with bad guys at your level, but only until you find that next piece of legendary gear or earn enough resources to level up a piece you already like. The skills on legendary gear, like a kanabo that turns enemies into shrapnel grenades when you break their armor, are impactful in a way that the generic percentage buffs to XYZ skill that you get from the lower tiers of gear never even come close to.
Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes a flashing blade to the series’ established norms, trimming them to a more precise form in lieu of chopping them down outright. Combat is aggressive and requires more intentional parrying and skill management than in the past, and exploring the gorgeous provinces of Sengoku-period Japan is encouraged thanks to the revamped map that deemphasizes collecting icons and checking off lists. Naoe and Yasuke are well-realized and memorable protagonists, even though most of the story they drive follows pretty predictable paths. Both have unique playstyles that bolster each other’s weaknesses, but they are ultimately imbalanced by the fact that you can make use of the stealth and exploration skills of the master shinobi far more than the superhuman strength of the samurai. This isn’t the Assassin’s Creed that will change the minds of folks that never connected with the series before, but for those of us with lots of hours logged in the Animus, the sum of Shadows’ parts provide a refreshing realignment of the series that you should not skip."
"Social media is currently flooded with AI-generated Studio Ghibli-inspired images as part of a trend sparked by the launch of OpenAI’s new GPT‑4o image generator — and it’s caused a vociferous debate that has seen old anti-AI comments from Hayao Miyazaki resurface.

In a demo of the new native image generation in ChatGPT and Sora led by CEO Sam Altman, OpenAI took a selfie and turned it into an image that looks like Studio Ghibli art.
this was a real labor of love from@gabeeegoooh. congrats gabe; excellent work!here is what we generated during the livestream:pic.twitter.com/fmHWp4d9AF
Sam Altman said on X / Twitter that OpenAI “put a lot of thought into the initial examples we show when we introduce new technology,” which suggests the Ghibli style was a deliberate choice.
And, a day after the demo, Altmantweeted:
Altman also changed his profile picture on X to a Ghibli-style image, which helped to kick off the trend we’re now seeing in which people are using the tech to create Studio Ghibli-style images or add a Studio Ghibli filter to existing images. Even the White House got in on the act with a hugely controversial tweet that sparked a major backlash online.
It's been 24 hours since OpenAI unexpectedly shook the AI image world with 4o image generation.Here are the 14 most mindblowing examples so far (100% AI-generated):1. Studio ghibli style memespic.twitter.com/E38mBnPnQh
Now, comments previously issued by Hayao Miyazaki, co-founder of Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli, are bubbling back up again to express the legendary filmmaker’s distaste for automated animation.
Studio Ghibli is of course famous for its meticulously animated, hand-drawn scenes and its dedication to the craft.The best Ghibli movies, such as Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, and Princess Mononoke, are beloved as much for the quality of their animation as their stories and characters.
The use of generative AI to copy the Ghibli style has caused some to point out that doing so flies directly in face of Miyazaki’s ethos on the creation of art. In 2016, in a widely-circulated clip from NHK’s documentary series NHK Special: Hayao Miyazaki — The One Who Never Ends, Miyazaki was shown an AI-generated monster with ""creepy"" movement that might have been applied to a zombie video game. The person leading the demo explained that AI could “present us grotesque movements that we humans can’t imagine.”
In response, Miyazaki said: ""Every morning, not in recent days, I see my friend who has a disability,” Miyazaki said. “It’s so hard for him just to do a high five; his arm with stiff muscle can’t reach out to my hand. Now, thinking of him, I can’t watch this stuff and find it interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is.”
“I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all,"" Miyazaki added. ""I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.”
Near the end of the clip, after hearing that the animators’ goal is to create a machine that “draws pictures like humans do,” Miyazaki said: “I feel like we are nearing to the end of the times. We humans are losing faith in ourselves.”
A reminder of Miyazaki’s take on AI: “I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all. … this is an insult to life itself … I feel like we’re nearing the end of times … We humans are losing faith in ourselves.”pic.twitter.com/ubAnVMlio5
Of course, Miyazaki’s comments came well before the generative AI tech we know today hit the headlines, but it stands to reason he would have a similar opinion of what’s happening online this week.
That’s a sentiment shared by actress and director Zelda Williams, who took to social media to join the backlash.
“People are gleefully sharing ‘Studio Ghibli style’ AI memes and photos, as though the man himself wouldn’t absolutely despise the technological piracy and negative effects on our environment.
“Anyway, go watch Princess Mononoke in theaters tonight, and f*** AI.”
Then, in a subsequent post, Williams continued: “The amount of ‘get used to it’, ‘it’s fun’, ‘stop whining’ that I see in response to anti-AI sentiments is wild.
“I can’t stop you from using the stupid, water wasting, s**tty facsimile machines, in the same way you can’t stop me from talking about how deeply empty life will become if we relegate the pursuit of art or knowledge to a machine because some people don’t like the effort of learning, whether that’s an artistic skill or homework in school.
“Lazy doesn’t just affect the body, it rots the mind.”
Roger Clark, the actor behind Red Dead Redemption's Arthur Morgan, also slammed this latest AI trend. Taking toX / Twitter, Clark said:
""This Studio Ghibli stuff is so depressing. It seems that there’s a new breed of ‘artist’ that invests absolutely nothing into their creative process. You can’t type a string of words into a prompt a couple of times and pretend it’s an artistic process.
""You’re not even coming up with your own style. You’re piggybacking off of someone else’s hard work and inspiration. You’re a lazy thief.
""You’re hurting the original art, you’re hurting your audience and you’re hurting yourself.""
In a more recenttweet, Altman said: ""one man's slop is another man's treasure.""
There are now questions being raised about whether the AI model was trained on Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli’s work, and, if so, whether OpenAI had a license to do that training.
OpenAI, which is already fighting copyright lawsuits over ChatGPT, said the new tool would take a “conservative approach” in the way it mimics the aesthetics of individual artists.
“We added a refusal which triggers when a user attempts to generate an image in the style of a living artist,” it said. But the company added in a statement that it “permits broader studio styles — which people have used to generate and share some truly delightful and inspired original fan creations.”
Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. The game failed, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”

"One of the reasons the MCU has been so successful over the years is that this shared universe leans heavily on the comic book source material. These movies aren’t usually direct adaptations of any one comic, but they always draw on iconic storylines and runs and make that classic material accessible to a wider audience. Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars will be no exceptions. These upcoming movies are inspired by both the original 1984 crossover Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars and 2015’s Secret Wars.

More From the MCU:How Many Minutes of Screen Time Can Each Avenger Really Get in Doomsday?
But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Now that we know themain cast of Avengers: Doomsday, we’re getting a clearer picture of which Marvel Comics storylines are inspiring this epic MCU adventure. From epic crossovers likeAvengers vs. X-Mento the debut of the Illuminati to two different versions of Secret Wars, these are the 75 Marvel comics that give us a better idea of whatAvengers: DoomsdayandAvengers: Secret Warsare about.
As seen in:The Avengers Vol. 5 #35-44, New Avengers Vol. 3 #24-33 (2015)
Again, Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars are heavily inspired by the two Secret Wars comics. This much we know from Kevin Feige and the Russo Bros. themselves, who are coming back to Marvel direct the films. But while we’ll get to Secret Wars itself in a bit, it’s worth starting out by focusing on the long, dramatic buildup to the 2015 comics version. That storyline, Avengers: Time Runs Out, will probably end up informing the plot of Doomsday as much as anything else.
From the beginning, Jonathan Hickman’s Avengers and New Avengers titles deal with the concept ofIncursions, that phenomenon where two parallel versions of Earth begin to collide and threaten to annihilate both universes unless one of the Earths is destroyed. The Incursions are revealed to be a symptom of a larger disease in the Marvel multiverse, one that seems destined to end in the complete obliteration of all existence.
Time Runs Out takes place in a particularly dire period for the Marvel Universe. Incursions are occurring more and more frequently, making the fight to stop them and save Earth-616 truly an existential crisis. Unfortunately, Time Runs Out also occurs in a period when the Avengers are more divided than they’ve been since the events of 2006’s Civil War. Once again, there are basically two opposing factions in this ideological battle. One law-abiding team of Avengers serves under S.H.I.E.L.D., while another group follows the Illuminati and their more pragmatic approach to survival.
Of course, Time Runs Out is more than just an Avengers story. Members of the X-Men and Fantastic Four also play key roles. And then there’s Doctor Doom. Doom is revealed to be a pivotal player in the conflict, as he takes on a new identity as Rabum Alal and attracts a cabal of fanatical followers. Doom’s war with the extra-dimensional entities known as The Beyonders is the source of the multiverse’s impending collapse. He sees himself as the savior of existence. Others might disagree.
We’ve already seen some plot threads inspired by Time Runs Out crop up during the Multiverse Saga. Thanks to thepost-credits scene in 2022’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, we know Benedict Cumberbatch’s Stephen Strange has joined forces with Charlize Theron’s Clea to investigate the Incursion problem. And an Incursion forms the crux of the climax of 2023’s The Marvels, resulting in Teyonah Parris’ Monica Rambeau becoming stranded on Earth-10005, a world whereKelsey Grammer’s Beast and the rest of the X-Menare making their own stand against Incursions.
If Avengers: Doomsday is an adaptation of any one Marvel story, it’s definitely going to be Time Runs Out. We’re sure to see the Incursion problem reach critical mass, prompting a desperate race to stave off the end of all things. Like in the comic, we may see the Avengers split down the middle in how they deal with this threat. Though in this case, we suspect we’ll see one team rally around Anthony Mackie’s Captain America and another around Robert Downey, Jr.’s Doctor Doom. And again, we’ll see the Fantastic Four and the X-Men drawn into the fray as everyone races to save their respective world. But if Doomsday is anything like the comic, it’s all going to be for naught in the end.
As seen in:New Avengers - The Illuminati #1-5 (2006)
In the buildup to Marvel’s Civil War crossover, readers first met the Illuminati, a shadowy group that included Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Mister Fantastic, Namor, Black Bolt, and Professor X. It was revealed that this group has been quietly manipulating events in the Marvel Universe for years, always in the name of protecting Earth from threats both within and without. Marvel’s New Avengers: The Illuminati miniseries explores the group’s actions in much greater depth.
Though they eventually disbanded, the Illuminati were reformed in Hickman’s Avengers run. The slightly revamped roster included new members like Black Panther, Beast, and Hulk (who was going through an unusually intelligent phase at the time). The Illuminati are also prominent players in Time Runs Out, resorting to questionable measures to protect Earth-616 from Incursions.
We already met one version of the Illuminati in the MCU in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, a group based on Earth-838. Unfortunately for them, they didn’t survive their run-in with Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch.
But could we meet the Earth-616 version of the Illuminati in Avengers: Doomsday? It’s hard not to come to that conclusion based solely on the cast list. What happens when you get Patrick Stewart’s Professor X, Pedro Pascal’s Reed Richards, Tenoch Huerta Mejía’s Namor, and Letitia Wright’s Black Panther in the same room? We even have to wonder if Downey’s Doom could take the place of Tony Stark here. As in the comic, we may see the Illuminati stoop to any and all measures to save their universe, even if it means damning themselves in the process.
As seen in:Avengers vs. X-Men #1-12 (2012)
Normally, the Avengers and X-Men are allies in the never-ending fight to defend the Marvel Universe. But the two teams became bitter enemies in 2012’s Avengers vs. X-Men storyline.
AvX comes at the tail end of a long period where the X-Men are fighting a losing battle to protect the mutant race from extinction. When it becomes apparent that the Phoenix Force is back and making a beeline for Earth, the X-Men see it as their last, best hope to restore the mutant population. The Avengers, however, see the Phoenix Force as a clear and present threat to everyone on Earth. That’s when the two teams come to blows.
We’ve already done a deep dive into Avengers vs. X-Men andthe ways in which it could inspire Avengers: Doomsday, but the gist is that we could see a very different take in the MCU on the concept of the two teams going to war. We’re not expecting a close adaptation of the comic book crossover, as the X-Men haven’t even been properly established in the MCU yet.
Instead, we think Doomsday’s AvX conflict would involve the multiverse. It stands to reason that Grammer is reprising the same version of Beast we saw in The Marvels’ post-credits scene, and that all the other X-Men confirmed for the film are residents of that same world, which we’re assuming is Earth-10005, a.k.a. the Fox X-Men movie universe. Eventually, Earth-616 and Earth-10005 will be linked together by an Incursion, forcing the MCU’s Avengers to battle the Fox universe’s X-Men for the fate of their respective worlds.
In that sense, the Avengers vs. X-Men conflict in Doomsday will probably be less inspired by the AvX crossover than it will the first chapter of 2015’s Secret Wars comic. In Secret Wars #1, the Marvel multiverse is reduced to just two remaining universes, the classic Marvel Universe and the Ultimate Universe. The Avengers and Ultimates go to war as the final Incursion breaks out, only for both worlds to be annihilated in the end. Doomsday may very well end in a similar battle between the Avengers and X-Men. Instead of working together to save the multiverse, they’ll be too busy fighting each other. And that’s where Secret Wars comes in.
As seen in:Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #1-12 (1984), Secret Wars #1-9 (2015)
At this point, we might as well talk about Secret Wars proper and how it’s likely to influence both Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars. As we mentioned earlier, Marvel has published two separate but not entirely unconnected Secret Wars comics, the first in 1984 and the second in 2015. The Russos have confirmed that both comics are an influence on their upcoming Avengers movies, though we’re definitely sensing more of the latter Secret Wars so far.
In the original Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars, a who’s who lineup of Marvel heroes and villains are abducted by a godlike being known as The Beyonder. He whisks them away to an artificial planet called Battleworld to fight for his amusement. In the end, Doom steals The Beyonder’s power for himself, temporarily achieving the strength to match his boundless ego. Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars is also notable for introducing Spider-Man’s black costume and paving the way for Venom.
2015’s Secret Wars, meanwhile, serves as the climax of Hickman’s sprawling Avengers run. We’ve already covered how the first issue features a desperate, doomed battle between two teams of heroes as the multiverse collapses around them. But the real meat of Secret Wars is in what happens next.
Even as the multiverse itself dies, Doom and his ally Molecule Man (a key player in the original Secret Wars crossover) make their final stand against The Beyonders. Doom steals their power and becomes omnipotent. He uses his newfound power to form a new Battleworld out of the broken fragments of dozens of dead universes. Doom then crowns himself God Emperor of Battleworld, with each realm controlled by a different Baron. It’s sort of the Marvel version of Dune or Game of Thrones.
As Secret Wars unfolds, Doom fights to hold his new kingdom together while a group of refugees from Earth-616 seeks a way to restore the multiverse. Fittingly, it all comes down to a final confrontation between God Emperor Doom and his greatest rival, Reed Richards. Even as a god, Doom can’t move past his hatred for Reed and his own self-loathing.
We don’t know how much, if at all, we’re going to see the two Secret Wars storylines adapted in Doomsday, but Avengers: Secret Wars is shaping up to be a fairly close adaptation of those comics. Once again, we’re expecting to see Downey’s Doom achieve ultimate power and form Battleworld out of the ashes of the multiverse. We’ll probably see a great many realms inspired by both the comics and various Marvel movies of years past. We’ll almost certainly see a motley team of heroes band together to restore the multiverse, including both MCU mainstays and iconic movie favorites like Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine and Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man. If you’re wondering how Marvel could ever top the fanboy glee of the portals sequence from Endgame, that’s how.
As seen in:Marvel Graphic Novel #27 - Emperor Doom (1987)
While the MCU is definitely drawing a lot of inspiration from Hickman’s Avengers run and Secret Wars for its portrayal of Doctor Doom, it’s worth taking a look at a much older story that also revolves around Doom crowning himself emperor. That story is 1987’s Emperor Doom graphic novel.
Emperor Doom shows us what happens when Doom finally grows tired of ruling one measly country and sets his sights on the entire planet. After harnessing the mind-controlling powers of Purple Man, Doom brainwashes the nations of the world into accepting him as their monarch. With no one to oppose him, Doom ushers in a new era of peace and prosperity. Life under Emperor Doom is actually pretty swell, so long as you don’t mind the total lack of free will. It falls on Wonder Man to free the Avengers and mount a resistance against Emperor Doom.
Marvel is also currently exploring a similar concept in the One World Under Doom crossover, which again sees Doom crown himself Emperor of a surprisingly docile and grateful planet.
Could we see elements of Emperor Doom when it comes to Downey’s version of the iconic villain? It’s definitely possible. The Russos have made it clear that Doom is someone who sees himself as the hero of his own story. He thinks he’s doing what has to be done to save the Marvel multiverse. Maybe we’ll see him crown himself emperor in Avengers: Doomsday, rallying the entire world to his cause. We suspect a great many people in the MCU would be only too happy to pledge their life to a guy with Tony Stark’s face.
As seen in:Infamous Iron Man #1-12 (2016)
To be honest, we’re still trying to wrap our heads around the surprise reveal thatDowney has been cast as Doctor Doom. Why bring back the most recognizable MCU actor to play a completely different character? What’s the significance of the fact that Doom looks like Tony Stark? Is he a version of Tony from another universe where things worked out differently, or is he merely using Tony’s face to further his own agenda?
Those are all questions we probably won’t see answered until Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters. But it certainly can’t hurt to look at one of the comics that explores the Iron Man/Doctor Doom relationship in greater depth.
For that, we recommend looking at 2016’s Infamous Iron Man, part of Brian Michael Bendis' larger Invincible Iron Man run. This series is set after the events of 2015’s Secret Wars. No longer a God Emperor, Victor von Doom has been healed in body and soul. He’s determined to prove himself a hero worthy of the mantle of Iron Man. And because Tony Stark himself is comatose at this point, there’s no one to actually stop Doom from giving it an honest go.
Will Infamous Iron Man have a direct influence on Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars? It’s hard to say. Though, if nothing else, we wouldn’t be surprised if the MCU draws on Doom’s character design in this series as it introduces a Tony Stark-ified version of Doctor Doom. Downey’s character may look less like the traditional Doom than he does this version that wears a silver and green Iron Man armor.
But again, we know that Downey’s character is someone who sees himself as being in the right. Doom firmly believes he’s the hero. There may be elements of Infamous Iron Man that work their way into that portrayal of Doom. He’s a character who needs to win hearts and minds if he’s going to carry out his plan of saving the multiverse.
As seen in:Fantastic Four - 1 2 3 4 (2002)
With all the spectacle and cosmic stakes going on in these next two Avengers movies, it’s all the more important they find time to focus on the smaller character moments. They need to be perfectly balanced enough to satisfy even Thanos himself. Avengers: Infinity War accomplished that task by giving us moments of levity between Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Doctor Strange and zeroing in on the doomed romance between Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch and Paul Bettany’s Vision. Endgame was basically one long fat joke at the expense of Chris Hemsworth’s Thor.
How will Avengers: Doomsday lighten the mood? We suspect that’s going to fall on Namor’s brawny shoulders. Anyone who’s read a Fantastic Four comic featuring Namor will know that the King of Atlantis has the hots for Susan Storm. Heck, he makes Wolverine’s deep infatuation with Jean Grey seem normal by comparison. Sue, for her part, has never really reciprocated Namor’s love over the years, but that’s never stopped his incessant flirtation. Hey, he’s a fish king. He’s not used to being told no.
Given that Doomsday is the first MCU movie to include both Vanessa Kirby’s Sue and Tenoch Huerta Mejía’s Namor, we can only assume we’re going to see this sexual tension play out on the big screen. Expect some of the movie’s more comedic moments to come as Namor woos Sue and she rebuffs his advances. As for Pedro Pascal’s Reed? If he’s anything like the comic book version, he may be too oblivious to notice. Sue may wind up leading Namor on just to get a rise out of her single-minded science dork of a husband.
Again, there are any number of comics the movie could draw from in this area. Namor’s unrequited love for Sue goes back a long time. But if Doomsday pulls from any one FF comic, we’d guess it would be 2002’s Fantastic Four: 1 2 3 4. That book, which is unusually dark for an FF story, may be the closest Sue has ever come to actually responding to Namor’s advances. 1 2 3 4 is also a very Doom-centric story, so that makes it all the more likely the screenwriters might have consulted this hidden gem of a Marvel comic.
And there you have it. If you want to do your homework before Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters in May 2026, you know what to read. But what Marvel storylines do you most want to see adapted in these next two Avengers movies? Let us know in the comments."
"The John Wick anime prequel filmfinally has a confirmed setting.

Announced during CinemaCon, the animated movie will see Keanu Reeves return to voice his character. This is in addition toReeves’ just-confirmed return to the role in live-action form for John Wick 5.
The animated film prequel will tell the story of John Wick’s legendary ‘Impossible Task,’ which is referenced in the movies as helping to create the mythos — and dread — surrounding Wick’s character.
Here’s the official blurb:
It will be produced by the John Wick producing team of Thunder Road’s Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee, 87Eleven Entertainment’s Chad Stahelski, and Keanu Reeves. 87Eleven Entertainment’s Alex Young and Jason Spitz will executive produce.
The film will be directed by Shannon Tindle, an animation veteran who most recently co-wrote and directed the Annie-nominated Netflix film Ultraman: Rising. Tindle also created the double Oscar nominee Kubo and the Two Strings and served as executive producer/showrunner on the Emmy-winning series Lost Ollie. The film will be written by Vanessa Taylor, writer and co-executive producer of Game of Thrones, writer of Divergent, and an Oscar nominee for her work with Guillermo del Toro on the Best Picture winner The Shape of Water.
Adam Fogelson, chair of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group, said: “In both animation and the world of John Wick, the possibilities are endless. And there is no John Wick story fans are clamoring for more than the Impossible Task. Shannon’s take on that story is an incredible one, and we are beyond excited to see what John Wick can do in animation.”
Stahelski added: “I’ve always been fascinated with anime. It has always been a huge influence on me, especially with the John Wick series. To have the opportunity to develop a John Wick anime seems to be the perfect progression for the John Wick world. I feel John Wick is the perfect property for this medium — anime holds the potential to expand our world, our characters, and our action in ways unimaginable before.”
It’s a massively busy time for the billion dollar John Wick franchise. In addition to the already released four mainline films and the just-announced John Wick 5, the John Wick Universe includes two spinoff films (Ballerina, to be released June 6, and a spinoff directed by and starring Donnie Yen reprising his Caine character, set to start production this summer).
In addition, Lionsgate Television produced The Continental: From the World of John Wick for Peacock and Amazon Prime, and Lionsgate confirmed it’s developing the series John Wick: Under the High Table, which Stahelski and Keanu Reeves are executive producing.
Outside TV and films, Lionsgate recently opened an immersive John Wick experience in Las Vegas and has a John Wick AAA video game in the works.

"If you, like many of us, thought that Nintendo was finally winding down its ongoing production of tiny plastic figures with real yet negligible functionality in its video games with the release of its next console, think again. The Nintendo Switch 2 isn't just compatible with old amiibo, Nintendo seems to be committed to still making new ones. Today, it announced Tulin, Yunobo, Riju, Sidon, and Mineru's construct figurines from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Kimberley, Luke, and Jamie figures from Street Fighter 6.

amiibo figures of Tulin, Yunobo, Riju and Sidon from The Legend of#Zelda:#TearsOfTheKingdomare releasing on June 5! Each one can unlock a fabric for Link’s paraglider, as well as weapons and materials for your adventure.pic.twitter.com/fG9dBiQftP
The first four figurines launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, and have compatibility with Tears of the Kingdom, unlocking a fabric for Link's paraglider. They'll also provide weapons and materials in-game, just like the existing Tears of the Kingdom Link amiibo and the other past Zelda-series amiibo that are already compatible with the game.An additional amiibo for Mineru's construct will become available at a later date. It's likely that Mineru at least will have some sort of pairing with thenewly-announced Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonmentgame coming this winter, as the game takes place during the era when Mineru was building and using her construct, and we saw some of its gameplay in the trailer today.
We also learned that three Street Fighter 6 characters will get amiibo to go along with the release of Street Fighter 6 on Nintendo Switch 2. Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly will all get amiibo releases on June 5 as well, and a new run of amiibo cards will also launch themed around Street Fighter characters. We know that all of these will unlock ""exclusive in-game content"" such as device wallpapers, photo frames, and character customization capabilities.
Street Fighter 6 is coming to Nintendo Switch™ 2 on June 5 along with a new edition of the game!🤝 Local Wireless Match💥 New Modes: Gyro Battle and Calorie Contest⭐ Classic, Modern, and Dynamic Supported by Joy-Con™ 2👤 3 amiibo™ figures and 22 amiibo cardspic.twitter.com/3nnvkyzPRr
It's undeniable that Nintendo had really tapered off its amiibo releases in recent years, so this news is a bit surprising. After an initial run of 18 back in 2014 when the figurines launched, it rapidly produced 71 different figures in 2015, and a steady cadence of 12 to 35 a year from 2016 until 2019. Amiibo releases slowed during the pandemic, and Nintendo began releasing fewer and fewer games with interesting amiibo support features. In 2024, only 7 new amiibo were released, and only two amiibo-compatible games: The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and Monster Hunter Stories. Given the slowdown, it's a bit surprising to see Nintendo recommit, but as long as collectors are still happy, right?

"The Nintendo Switch 2 arrives on June 5, 2025, and it will likely be a hot commodity when it launches. Over on the official Nintendo store, the company is implementing some pre-order measures to ensure bona fide Switch players are getting their pre-orders.

On theMy Nintendo Store, those with a Nintendo Account can register their interest in pre-ordering a Nintendo Switch 2 system and ""select accessories"" from the Nintendo Store. Those who express interest will then get an invitation email once their turn in line comes up, valid for 72 hours. The catch? You'll need to have put in some time on your old Switch, and been a Switch Online member.
""Invitation emails will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis to registrants who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025,"" according to the fine print on the site.
Nintendo also notes that invitations are ""non-transferable"" and will be sent to email addresses associated with the Nintendo Account that registers interest. For the system and each accessory, there will also be a one-per-account limit during the invitation period. Currently on the site, you can express interest in either a base Nintendo Switch 2 system, or the one bundled with Mario Kart World.
Orders will be shipped after purchase, and the approximate shipping date will be provided when ordering. Nintendo also specifies: ""Please note that release-day delivery is not guaranteed due to processing and shipment times.""
While not said outright by Nintendo, all of these measures seem dedicated towards ensuring that someone buying a Switch 2 through this process is someone who wants to purchase and play a Switch 2 for themselves, rather than flip it online.
Scalping has been a frequent problem for new releases of sought-after products. Notably, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S sawscalpers pursuing the new hardware, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game hasbeen dealing with ongoing scalping and shortages.
Valve found some success in its queue system for the Steam Deck, utilizing a method that tied Steam accounts to purchases alongside checks for whether an account was made before, or after, a certain window.It worked, and it's not surprising now to see Nintendo taking similar measures with the My Nintendo Store process.
Of course, there will be other ways to pick up a Switch 2. But hopefully options like this can help some long-time Switch 1 owners avoid the potential chaos of locking down a launch day Switch 2 pre-order.

"When Pocketpair's monster capturing survival adventurePalworldlaunched, many people compared it to Pokemon, specificallycalling it  ""Pokemon with guns."" It's not Pocketpair's favorite comparison, according to communications director John 'Bucky' Buckley, but the thought of collecting a following of adorable monsters has nonetheless prompted a number of people to ask if Palworld would ever make it to Pokemon's platform of choice, the Nintendo Switch.

Unfortunately, according to Buckley, that's not in the cards, largely due to technical reasons. ""If we could make the game work on the Switch, we would, but Palworld is a beefy game.""
I spoke to Buckley at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco last week following his talk, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During our chat, I also asked Buckley about the possibility of a Nintendo Switch 2 release. He said that Pocketpair is interested, but hasn't gotten a chance to see if a port is even possible yet.
""We haven't seen those specs yet,"" he said. ""Like everyone else, we're waiting. I'm walking around GDC hoping someone will tell me them, but everyone I've spoken to says they haven't even seen them.
""If it's beefy enough, it's 100% worth considering. We did a lot of optimization for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with. Still work to do, but we're really happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible.""
Pocketpairremains entangled in a lawsuit from Nintendo over alleged patent infringement against Pokemon's ball-throwing mechanics, leading some to speculate that to be the actual reason Palworld hadn't made it to Switch.
But the lawsuit isn't really what's stopping the studio from releasing games on Nintendo's platforms,as we saw back in January. Buckleyaddressed the lawsuit very briefly in his GDC talk, saying that it caught the team by surprise, and that the team had done numerous legal checks in the lead-up to release in order to prevent that exact thing. ""Pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge fan [of Pokemon],"" Buckley said in the talk, ""so it was a very depressing day, everyone heads down and walking in the rain.""
The question is, would Nintendo allow a game it's taken such issue with on its next-gen console?
We'll be posting our full interview with Buckley at GDC later this week, so keep checking back for more about Palworld. In the meantime, it's a great time to revisit Palworld if you've stepped away, asthe game just got cross-platformplay in a new update last week.

"The most surprising reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct might have been a third-party game. Announced near the end of the showcase, FromSoftware is developing a brand-new game calledThe Duskbloods, which has some striking similarities to the beloved PlayStation 4-exclusive Bloodborne.

The Duskbloods is a new game, to be clear, set to arrive sometime in 2026 worldwide, and exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2. Playing as the ""Bloodsworn,"" a group that has gone beyond humanity thanks to special blood, players will enter a violent melee to become the ""First Blood.""
Confirmed in a press release from FromSoftware, The Duskbloods is a PvPvE title with ""online multiplayer at its core,"" with up to eight players battling for the win among themselves. So while all the blood, guns, and machinery brings to mind Bloodborne, it may also have quite a bit in common with the upcomingElden Ring Nightreign, though with some PvP rather than solely co-op PvE.
We didn't get much more than that, besides cryptic teases and some looks at some horrifying beasts and bosses. Still, Bloodborne fans are having a wide variety of reactions to this.
""BLOOD! EVERY FIVE SECONDS THEY TALKED ABOUT BLOOD!"" saidone commenter in the r/Bloodborne post about The Duskbloods on Reddit. Another said: ""That game is 100% Bloodborne 2. I assume the name change is either because it's in a different setting, or because of Sony exclusivity.""
Though The Duskbloods is still different, it's easy to see the connections that would have fans feeling like it's a spiritual sucessor to Bloodborne. And while the Souls games and Elden Ring have gone onto other systems — Elden Ring even got aTarnished Edition locked in for the Switch 2— Bloodborne has remained a PlayStation 4 exclusive since release, not even making it over to PC. A port, sequel, or really anything has been something fans have wanted for years.
""Nintendo really got tired of waiting for Bloodborne 2 and just decided to fund it themselves,"" anothercommenter said. Another reply points out that, much like Bloodborne, The Duskbloods is currently a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. ""Bloodborne was always an exclusive, this is on brand,"" areplier added.
The announcement definitely kick-started the Bloodborne faithful, though reality has been setting in with confirmation that this sounds like a battle royale-style game, rather than a single-player RPG you'd normally expect from FromSoftware.
Some commenters startedexpressing dulled excitementover the revelation that The Duskbloods is a PvPvE experience. Threads have sprung up of fans finding this out, only to then express that between a multiplayer focus and Switch 2 exclusivity, they might not be so eager to jump on for The Duskbloods.
We're due to learn more about The Duskbloods soon, as Nintendo will post an interview with director Hidetaka Miyazaki on its website on April 4. Presumably this will shed some light on how exactly The Duskbloods will work, what its PvPvE will look like, and whether this can truly be enough to sate the Bloodborne fans who've been holding out hope for so long.

"Kirby has been a steadfast Nintendo mascot for 33 years, ever since the character debuted in 1992’s Kirby’s Dream Land for Game Boy. In addition to being a Smash Bros. staple, Kirby and his ever-evolving powers of inhalation have starred in over two dozen games, culminating in the series’ best-selling game to date, Kirby and the Forgotten Land.

As we near the end of Nintendo’s current console generation, we’ve compiled a list of every Kirby game on the Switch as well asnew Kirby gamescoming to the Switch 2.
Six Kirby games have been released on Nintendo Switch, while 11 more retro Kirby games are playable withNintendo Switch Online. The franchise debuted on Switch in 2018 with Kirby Star Allies; its latest release, Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe, arrived in 2023. A new Kirby game,Kirby Air Riders, will be releasing for theNintendo Switch 2in 2025.
Kirby’s Switch debut came in 2018 withKirby Star Allies. The action-platformer is played with a party of four (multiplayer or local AI) and sees Kirby combine abilities with allies to solve puzzles and enhance combat.
Series developer HAL Laboratories and Nintendo brought the pink puff back the following year for the free-to-playSuper Kirby Clash. Like Star Allies, Clash is played with a team of four that can be controlled by other human players or AI. Unlike Star Allies, this is not a platformer but rather a standalone boss rush mode; it features a hub world for changing equipment and selecting quests, though the heart of the game is the series of boss fights that serve as those quests.
A sequel to the 3DS game Kirby Fighters Deluxe (an expanded version of the subgame Kirby Fighters found in Kirby: Triple Deluxe),Kirby Fighters 2is exactly what it sounds like: a fighting game starring Kirby. It supports up to four players and features Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede, Bandana Waddle Dee, Gooey, and Magolor as playable characters.
The series’ standout game on Switch,Kirby and the Forgotten Landis a post-apocalyptic adventure in which Kirby gets sucked into a wormhole that appears above Dream Land. The Forgotten Land is the series’ first fully 3D platformer, complete with puzzles and Kirby’s signature ability-based combat. It’s the series’ best-selling game to date, selling more than 7.5 million copies by the end of March 2024. There's even a Switch 2 version of this game currentlylisted to be available for preorder.
Kirby’s Dream Buffetis a dessert-themed multiplayer game released in 2022. It features three four-player game modes: race, minigame, and battle royale. The modes can be played separately or together as part of Dream Buffet’s Gourmet Grand Prix.
The series’ latest game,Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxeis a remake of the 2011 Wii game Kirby’s Return to Dream Land. The action-platformer came to Switch with improved visuals, a new easy mode (Helper Magolor), three new abilities (Sand, Mecha, and Festival), and an all-new two-hour adventure called Magolor Epilogue: The Interdimensional Traveler.
Return to Dream Land Deluxe supports local co-op for up to four players, with each player taking control of either Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede, or Bandana Waddle Dee.
There are 11 Kirby games available with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Those with a regular subscription can play nine Kirby games from NES, SNES, and Game Boy, while those with the more expensive Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription get access to two additional games: Kirby & The Amazing Mirror (GBA) and Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards (N64).
Here’s the list of Kirby games playable with Nintendo Switch Online, ordered by initial release date:
Anew GameCube librarywill also be available in the NSO + Expansion Pack membership on Switch 2, which may include Kirby Air Ride.

The era of Kirby on Switch may be coming to a close, but the character's journey on the Switch 2 has just begun.Kirby Air Riderswas officially announced during theApril 2025 Nintendo Directas a follow-up to the 2003Kirby Air Ride racing gameon GameCube. Masahiro Sakurai, creator of both the Kirby series and Super Smash Bros., returns as director of the new game.
Kirby and the Forgotten Land is also on the list of games that will be gettingSwitch 2 upgrades. The upgrade will take advantage of the Switch 2'simproved specsand includes a new story expansion. Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World will be released on August 28 with a discounted upgrade option for those who owned the original game on Switch.

"Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Editionis out today for Nintendo Switch consoles, and some players are already digging into the data to learn more about it. One discovery seems to reveal a ""hidden"" mode enabling 60 frames per second, which is certainly cause for curiosity and speculation about what it could mean for the Switch 2.

Over onX/Twitter(viaWccftech), modder MasaGratoR dug into the executable of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition and found what they called a ""hidden 60 FPS mode."" The modder said it seems to be implemented ""only partially,"" since enabling it causes ""weird issues.""
About Xenoblade Chronicles X:- Dynamic resolution ranges: 504p-720p handheld, 760p-1080p docked- Game's executable has hidden 60 FPS mode. It seems to be implemented only partially since enabling it causes weird issues. As a proof screen from function that sets UI speed, 1.0.1pic.twitter.com/Ag09YVQ7g1
While it's not implemented in the game proper, the existence of this setting does spark some interesting questions. If it's not available, why is it in there? While some stray leftover code could be one answer, some speculation about what this could mean for the Switch 2 and existing Switch games is also easy to understand.
Nintendo has confirmed that theSwitch 2 will bemostlybackward compatible. The official reveal of its next console said that the console will play Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games, as well as Nintendo Switch games, with an asterisk that certain Nintendo Switch games ""may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.""
It's hard to imagine Xenoblade Chronicles X would be one of those asterisked games, but there is a question over whether existing Switch games would get enhanced on the next-gen console. There's no proof of that yet, just speculation over the usual trends of backward compatibility. It certainly makes the Switch 2 all the more interesting for existing Switch owners, though.
We'll hopefully learn more in just a few weeks, whenNintendo airs its Switch 2 Direct on April 2, 2025. There, we'll learn more about the upcoming console and Nintendo's plans for it.

"Editor’s note: This interview was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior toNintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States due to the potential impact of tariffs. Parts of this interview were edited for clarity.

Nintendo has finally pulled back the curtain onNintendo Switch 2, revealing the company's vision for its next-generation console and its games. Butovershadowing dicussion around what the Switch 2 is capable of, the new gameplay mechanics inMario Kart World, and OG Switch games that will find a new lease of life on Switch 2, isa backlash to Nintendo's pricing strategy.
We sat down with Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience Bill Trinen to talk about the big first-party reveals like Mario Kart World andDonkey Kong Bananza, the strategy behindpricing Switch 2 at $450andMario Kart at $80, the decision to releaseNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour as a paid digital productrather than a pack-in game, his excitement forMetroid Prime 4: Beyond's mouse controlsandMasahiro Sakurai's return to the Kirby franchise, and more. Plus, does Bill know what Switch 2 cartridges taste like? Read our full interview below to find out.
IGN:Congrats on finally unveiling Nintendo Switch 2. How does it feel to finally have it out there?
Bill Trinen:Well, it's just exciting to be able to get all the details out there. For us, the most important thing is that we really want people to recognize and understand that Nintendo Switch 2 is the true successor to Nintendo Switch, takes what you love about Nintendo Switch, and then builds on it with a whole lot of new features and new capabilities and new games that take advantage of those. And really takes what has evolved gaming with Nintendo into something that's a lot more social through things likeGameChat, which takes what was the anytime, anywhere play of Nintendo Switch and makes it more all together, anytime, anywhere.
IGN:So you just mentioned GameChat, that was a huge part of your presentation yesterday. Why was now the time to finally introduce Nintendo voice chat, which is something that people have wanted on your consoles for a really long time?
Trinen:Well, I would say we've always looked at it from the perspective of, 'what is Nintendo's real strength and what are Nintendo's real values?' And for us, the most important thing is putting smiles on people's faces and doing it in a way that people can see and experience the smiles that they have with the people that are most important to them.
And certainly there have been other game systems with chat and things like that up until now, but what we wanted to do was to take something that could finally replicate that same room, couch multiplayer, couch co-op experience and joy, and bring that into an online space. And so for us, GameChat is why it's so important is the combination of being able to see their faces, being able to see what they're doing from a gameplay perspective and being able to feel like you've finally got a virtual space where you can have those same experiences that you might have in your living room. So that's why with the power of, I would say Switch 2, being able to finally execute that has been a big focus for us.
IGN:Cool. And we always knew if you did voice chat, it would be in the most Nintendo way, and just with the camera and the mic on the unit in the dock and you say, 'oh, don't worry the background noise won't get in.' It was a cool presentation.
Trinen:Good. And that's the nice thing is with the built-in microphone, it's like, yeah, you can just voice chat if you want and you can do that portably as well.
IGN:Well, let's talk about Donkey Kong Bananza. I love the title by the way, it's perfect. Although last night when I was scrambling to typemy preview, it autocorrected to 'Bonanza' every time, and I was like, 'I’ve got to add this to my dictionary.' But I love the name and it's so exciting to see DK back in the spotlight after so long. And I noticed so many things just getting my hands on the controller for the first time. So when you guys got this game in at Nintendo of America, what stuck out to you the most? What was your favorite part about working on it from a localization perspective or anything else?
Trinen:Well, so I'll start with a really terrible joke, which is I like to call this the most groundbreaking game in video game history.
IGN:[Laughs] I used that in my preview today. I said, 'you have to break all the ground you can because you might make a groundbreaking discovery.'
Trinen:[Laughs] That's right. So for us, the number one thing that I think is probably just the most satisfying about this game is just DK the character. He's back, he's back in a big way. And DK is a character within the pantheon of Nintendo characters who has always been a bit on the more powerful side, wild at times, silly.
And all of that has just been thoroughly baked into this game. And as the character DK, you're able to use the power of his punches and you might attack an enemy in the environment, and that enemy goes flying and hits a wall and the wall crumbles and you see something there, and that then entices you to go in and start digging through the terrain to see what else you can find back there. And it just creates this incredibly rewarding cycle of destruction and discovery that is woven all throughout the game.
IGN:The discovery via destruction was a really cool cornerstone of this game from my time with it. I thought that was just really great. And the second that I started playing it, I just felt the DNA ofSuper Mario Odysseyand Mr. [Yoshiaki] Koizumi's team all over this in so many ways. Are they the ones that are working on this?
Trinen:It's a very good question. You'll have to stay tuned. We always like to start by showcasing the game and getting people focused on the gameplay, but we'll have some information to share about the developer in due time.
IGN:Okay. Can you tell me, is this internally developed? Because there hasn't been an internal Donkey Kong game since I believe Jungle Beat was the last one?
Trinen:Jungle Beat was the last one.
IGN:You had the NST (Nintendo Software Technology) do the Mario vs. Donkey Kongs, but...
Trinen:NST has done the Mario vs. Donkey Kong games, but this is going to be a fun one.
IGN:So nothing more on that?
Trinen:Nothing more on that yet.
IGN:Okay. I had to try. Let's talk about Mario Kart World, because there's so much great stuff in there, but I thinkthe cow is what's stealing everybody's heart. Did you expect that reaction? There's Akira memes about the cow, it's hilarious out there. Did you know the cow was going to be a big star?
Trinen:I would say perhaps not as big as the cow has become. Internally, certainly the very first moment that we saw the cow, everybody wanted to play as Cow.
IGN:When we were playing Knockout Tour yesterday, there were just like seven cows on the track.
Trinen:Well, that's the other thing that I just love about Mario Kart World is with the interconnected world of tracks, as I'm driving, you'll start something like Knockout Tour and you'll be driving across the continent. And what used to be the Mario Kart model was there's discrete tracks and you race on a discrete track and then you choose a different track and you race on a different discrete track.
And now what I find is I'm driving through, I'm starting in a new track and driving across the terrain and, 'Oh, I just happened to pass through Moo Moo Meadows and now I'm onto the next thing.' And it's just like for somebody that's grown up playing Mario Kart for so many years, just to be able to have that experience and piece it all together mentally into this big massive continent of racing has been a whole lot of fun for me.
IGN:It feels like a theme park of Mario Kart history, and I'm driving yesterday and going through all the different segments and then all of a sudden, 'Oh, I'm in the geyser tunnel from Dino Dino Jungle from Double Dash.' But I'm wondering, so right now it seems like the races, you start at one track and end up at another, and then the final lap is one loop around that final circuit you end up at. Not in the Knockout Tour, that's different, but is there a time trial or versus race mode that’s a way to just do three laps at this track? Or are you always driving interconnected between them when you're racing?
Trinen:You will have abilities to drive three laps on certain tracks. Obviously we've got a Nintendo Direct dedicated to Mario Kart World coming. I think you'll see a lot more on the game there, and I think a lot more that will hopefully surprise you and make you really feel like, 'Wow, there's a lot to this game.'
IGN:That will be really good to see. Because right now it looks great, it plays great, but I think the talk of the town is the price tag. This is an $80 game from Nintendo in the United States and $50 if you buy the Nintendo Switch 2 bundle. But I saw somewhere on your website that that bundle is only available for a limited time while supplies last. Can you just talk about the strategy behind pricing Mario Kart World this way?
Trinen:Well, I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value? Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, but I did read your article this morning and I think you had mentioned that you didn’t find a lot to discover when roaming around. So I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out about that.
But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.
IGN:Okay. And to just stay on pricing for a little bit here.I'm looking at the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of games and some games are $70, some are $80. That's what it's looking like right now. And some are cheaper than that too. I don't think we know the U.S. price for the Welcome Tour yet, but I think we saw the Japanese price is around $10.
Trinen:Yeah, the U.S. price is $9.99 for the Welcome Tour.
IGN:$9.99. Okay, digital only.
Trinen:Yes.
IGN:I'm just wondering about the strategy behind pricing these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions at the combination of the Switch 1 retail price, usually $59.99, and then whatever that upgrade path is, like $10 for Breath of the Wild, making that a $70 game, or Tears of the Kingdom is an $80 game because it's $70 plus the $10 upgrade path. Can you just walk me through the strategy behind not offering any sort of discount for newcomers on Switch 2 and saying, 'Tears of the Kingdom is $80 now just like Mario Kart is?'
Trinen:Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?' What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you're looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that's the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game.
For somebody who has bought Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the Zelda upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership. So there's no additional charge for those. But I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that.
IGN:Okay, thanks. And then the pricing for the console itself, too. A lot of people are talking about it — $450 in the United States, and we know there are definitely global economic factors at play. Can you share anything behind the strategy for pricing of the console? Was this something that was up to the wire where you didn't know what it was going to cost until recently? Can you share any insight?
Trinen:Can't really share insight into any of that. Obviously the cost of everything goes up over time, and I personally would love if the cost of things didn't go up over time. But I think any time you're building a new system that's got new features and new tech, there's costs associated with that. So again, we look at what is the experience on Nintendo Switch? What's the experience on Nintendo Switch 2? What are the new features that it offers? And certainly there's the cost of goods and things that factor into that, but we try to find the right appropriate price for a product based on that.
IGN:Last question on price, I promise. I played Welcome Tour on the show floor and I walked away and thought, 'this is a perfect pack-in game.' It shows what the console is, it shows HDR, it shows these new technologies Nintendo is embracing — in some cases for the first time — and I feel like it's a great showcase for the console. Was there ever any talk of making this a pack-in game, and why did you make the decision to price it as a separate digital product?
Trinen:It's an interesting product. We're actually getting ready today, we're going to be doing someNintendo Treehouse Live segmentsand covering a lot of games in detail. That's one of them. And I think people will be able to see through Treehouse Live probably a little bit more maybe than you were able to see on the show floor. It's a pretty robust piece of software. There's a lot of great detail in there.
For some people, I think there are people who are particularly interested in the tech and the specs of the system and things like that, for them I think it's going to be a great product. It's really for people that want more information about the system rather than necessarily a quick intro to everything it does. And for that reason and just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, 'Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you're getting out of the product.'
IGN:Okay. I want to talk about some of the features of the Joy-Con 2 now because I was really impressed with the mouse functionality. I thought that it worked really, really well in something like Metroid Prime 4. I can see that being the preferred way for a lot of people to play that game. So what are your expectations for mouse controls? Are you hoping that third-party developers make great use of them? Do you think it can bring new types of games? Just talk to me about your feelings about the mouse.
Trinen:Well, personally, I'm really excited about the mouse control. I don't know what your experience with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was, the way that to me is probably my favorite way to play is I like to play split Joy-Con. I just like the freedom of having my hands not locked onto a controller like that. So I often like to play split Joy-Con and having the freedom to just seamlessly drop the mouse down for combat and then pick it back up for split Joy-Con, to me is something, number one, you can't do with any other console, you can't do on PC.
And it makes for a really great experience for the Prime series, particularly because the Prime series is the creator of the first-person adventure genre. And so in a series where you're doing a lot of exploration that's got some combat mixed in with it, that freedom feels right. Because for me, I feel like if I'm doing a lot of exploration, I want to be split Joy-Con. That flexibility to me is amazing.
I think the other thing that probably I'm hoping people are catching onto is that, yes, the Joy-Con 2 introduced mouse control, but they introduce mouse control in conjunction with the other technology within the Joy-Con. So whereas with a PC mouse, you're moving up and down and side to side and whatnot, with the Joy-Con, you've got the added ability to apply things like the angle that you're twisting the Joy-Con at, and having that also impact the play control with the mouse.
Or you've got two Joy-Con that have mouse control each, and that means two things. It means either you can have immediate two-player mouse control gameplay right out of the box with the Nintendo Switch 2, or it means, as we see withDrag x Drive, that you can do things with dual Joy-Con control, which hasn't been done before. And so my hope is really threefold. One, is that our own development teams continue to experiment with what they can do with the mouse to create creative new ways to use it.
I hope that we start to see third-parties that are then looking at opportunities with things like dual mouse control or combination of mouse plus motion control to evolve their gameplay. But I also do hope that when you look at PC developers, for example, if they want to bring a PC-based game to console, they have to spend a lot of time revamping the control scheme and adapting it to button controls. And so having the freedom of mouse control with the Joy-Con hopefully makes PC developers a lot more eager to want to bring their games to Nintendo Switch 2.
IGN:Well, my social team really wants to know. We don't have Switch 2 cartridges here. Do they taste like Switch 1 cartridges?
Trinen:[Laughs] I don't know yet.
IGN:You haven't done a taste test?
Trinen:I have not done a taste test. I keep hoping for pistachio flavor, but that's not happening.
IGN:[Laughs] I don't think that would turn away the kids. Okay, cool. Well, my last question here is that Kirby Air Riders was a huge surprise at the Nintendo Direct yesterday. And to see that is this secret project thatMr. [Masahiro] Sakurai teased earlier this year after wrapping up his YouTube series. Cool to see him come back to work with you guys again. Can you share any details further than that teaser we got in the Direct?
Trinen:Well, I believe Mr. Sakurai has said that there will not be any additional information on the game for quite a while. The team's working very hard on it. But for me, this was probably one of the most exciting announcements for a couple of reasons.
One, I'm always excited to see what Sakurai-san is working on. Two, he created the Kirby character and the Kirby franchise. And so it's great to see him come back to lead and direct a Kirby game again for the first time in a couple of decades. But I think more importantly, I've always felt that Kirby Air Ride on GameCube was a game that was ahead of its time and maybe not fully understood at the time that it came out.
And so I'm just really excited because there's a core group of people that played that game on GameCube that love it to death. And number one, I'm just happy because for them, this is such a big announcement and it's so good to see their excitement. But at the same time, I think that with where we are in the game industry today, I think we've got a real opportunity to introduce a much bigger audience to Kirby Air Riders. And I think people will finally really begin to appreciate just what I think is the genius of Masahiro Sakurai and what he created with that game.
IGN:Well, I'm in that core group. It's like one of my big childhood games. I love Kirby Air Ride, City Trial Free Roam. That's all I was doing, so I'm very excited. But thanks so much, Bill. We're super excited for June 5 and everything else that's coming on the way.
Trinen:Great. Thank you.

"Editor’s note: This interview was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior toNintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States due to the potential impact of tariffs. Parts of this interview were edited for clarity.

After getting hands-on with Nintendo Switch 2 at last week’s reveal in New York, IGN spoke with the hardware leads spearheading the development of Nintendo’s newest console. Kouchi Kawamoto and Takuhiro Dohta from Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning and Development Department, along with Tetusya Sasaki from Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, talked to IGN’s Brian Altano about the technology behind Switch 2, the classic Nintendo handhelds that have inspired them and the impact former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata’s legacy had on the development of the console.
IGN:Can you talk about the SOC system on a chip the Nintendo Switch 2 was running? Is it Nvidia Tegra? If not, can you reveal which graphics architecture it's based on?
Nintendo:I think you'll find a lot of the details in NVIDIA's information that they've shared.
IGN:One of the notes in the direct suggested to hit 4K in dock mode, upscaling may be required. What kind of upscaling is this system using? Is it using AI upscaling?
Nintendo:I think probably the main kind of easiest upscaling to use is the DLSS that Nvidia provides. So from that standpoint, I guess you could say this AI.
Nintendo:That said, we're planning on providing other options of upscaling through software and so ranging from something that uses AI to something that's not. I think you'll see that as time passes. And lastly, I'll add that even though there is upscaling, there's also the option to not upscale and just output natively. So that's also an option that developers can use.
IGN:What about ray tracing? Is that something that your team experimented with?
Nintendo:Just like DLSS, that's when we're kind of making the graphics of a game. We consider ray tracing as just another tool to do that – it's not that we're going to try to use ray tracing on everything, but really trying to figure out what types of graphics, what types of screens, what types of situations are best suited for ray tracing, and then trying to apply that. That's the approach we took when we did all of our researching and experimenting.
IGN:We saw that the switch two supports third party cameras. What about third-party mice?
Nintendo:You're talking about USB mice, things like that?
IGN:Yeah, not the animal!
Nintendo:[Laughs] It really depends on the game software with the structure. So if that software supports third-party USB mice, yes.
IGN:I have a six-year-old daughter. She took my Switch and I don't get to play it anymore. She also has dropped it a lot and it's okay. What have you done with Switch 2 to make sure that it can survive a kid dropping it on the floor or dropping it down the stairs?
Nintendo: Nintendo has made very sturdy devices through the ages and I believe that this time around as well, we've made something that will be sturdy.
Nintendo:Yeah, you can drop it a little bit. I don’t recommend it though!
IGN:I also have a Steam Deck and I like it, but the fan gets very loud when I'm playing high end games. It's almost distracting. What did Nintendo do to make sure that that was taken into account when designing the hardware for Switch 2?
Nintendo:When a fan is loud it really does affect one's gameplay, so that is definitely something we had in the back of our mind during the development of the Nintendo Switch 2. The system is made to adapt depending on the processing capability so I'm kind of curious to hear from the others here what their experience has been like.
Nintendo:When I was playing it it's not like, “Wow, there's a fan in there”. It hasn’t really gotten to the point where, even through development of the hardware, it has bothered me in any way.
Nintendo:The hardware team put quite a lot of effort into making sure the airflow was smooth. So a lot is coming in but there's a lot coming out, and as such the fan noise isn't too significant.
IGN:Nintendo invented the directional pad and it's been important for video games for my entire life. What did your team do to ensure that the Dpad on the Switch 2 was great for fighting games, puzzle games, platformers, all that fun stuff?
Nintendo:You may think that every time you see the directional pad that it's just the same button being reused, but the truth is we do make small adjustments and add small changes every time. I have people – our development and game development teams – try them out when we make a new one.
Nintendo:This is a more detailed point but for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller directional buttons, we made it so that it's even more difficult to have mistaken input. Of course, it doesn't completely eliminate that possibility but it should reduce it.
IGN:I'm a big fan of Nintendo handheld systems and always have been since the original Game Boy. What are each of your personal favorite classic Nintendo handhelds?
Nintendo:I have fond memories for each of the systems that have come out but for me personally, I think the original Game Boy really has a special place in my heart. Part of the reason for that is that since then there's obviously new systems that came out, like the Game Boy Advance for example. But I just distinctly remember my mother with the original Game Boy playing Tetris, and that’s just burned into my memory.
IGN:Some of you worked with the legendary Satoru Iwata. Is there any specific part of his legacy that inspired the Nintendo Switch 2 design?
Nintendo:There are various aspects but what comes to mind first is the magnet connector. We originally didn't adopt it for the Nintendo Switch because it wasn't as secure as we would've liked. However, we put a lot of effort into this aspect and that has come to fruition.
Nintendo:It was Mr. Iwata's concerns about the magnets that meant it didn't come to fruition [for the original Switch]. So being able to actually address all of the issues and create something that probably would've met his standards is moving and meaningful.
IGN:I love it. I think I took the JoyCon on and off 20 times yesterday!
Nintendo:I actually have a question for you. You saw the footage of the JoyCon 2 snapping on and off. Was the impression you got from that footage different from actually snapping it on and off?
IGN:Yes. I thought it was going to be like a refrigerator magnet and it was going to be wobbly loose and instead it just goes ‘snap’ and clicks in. And I was like, “Oh, that feels really nice.”
Nintendo:I'm very relieved to hear that!
IGN:Yeah, they told me I had to stop doing it!
Brian Altano has been playing Mario Kart for 30+ years, and it's crazy that 10 of those years were spent with Mario Kart 8. We haven't seen Battle Mode for Mario Kart World yet, but he's still holding out hope that Block Fort can come back. Bring back Block Fort!"
"Nintendo’s first post-Switch 2 Nintendo Direct Treehouse livestream is being flooded with angry comments from users calling on the company to ""DROP THE PRICE.""

A cursory glance at the YouTube chat for the stream shows a flood of complaints about the pricing of Nintendo’s move to the next-generation, which includes the $449.99 Switch 2 and, perhaps most controversially,the jump to $79.99 for Mario Kart World.
Whilethe Nintendo Switch 2 system itself will retail for $449.99, a bundle is also available with Mario Kart Worldincluded for $499.99, saving $30 on the price of the game.
But Mario Kart World isn’t the only Nintendo Switch 2 game to cost $79.99.Some Nintendo Switch 2 Edition titles, such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, also cost $79.99.
Nintendo has even come under firefor charging for the Switch 2 tutorial video game experience, Welcome Tour, which fans have said should be a free pack-in.Astro's Playroom, for example, comes pre-installed on every PlayStation 5 console, serving additionally as a free tech demo for the DualSense controller.

The shock at Nintendo’s pricing is now spilling over into the Treehouse livestream, although the presenters have so far, perhaps understandably, ignored the chat. It seems likely that Nintendo will face this sort of thing from the video game community from now on, piling the pressure on the company to address the complaints.

"It looks like Nintendo Korea's website briefly gave away what sidekick may be joining Kong in the upcomingDonkey Kong Bananza.

Though the image was quickly switched out with a less revealing one, it wasn't quite quick enough forResetEra, which managed to grab a screenshot before the website was changed.
Warning!Potential Donkey Kong: Bananza spoilers follow:
In most key art associated with the game, we see Kong smashing a fist into the ground, throwing up a shower of rocks and rubble, with the purple, rock-like Odd Rock behind him. The image on the Korean website essentially showed the same, but with one key difference: Odd Rock is missing, and a young Pauline is holding on for dear life to Kong's necktie.
This is the first time Pauline's been acknowledged in any of the images, teaser trailers, or hands-on previews shown thus far, suggesting Nintendo was perhaps hoping to keep her appearance a surprise. Whoops!
More intriguingly still, Pauline's young age suggests Donkey Kong Bananza could be a prequel of some sort — although again, Nintendo's tight-lipped on that for now.
""I think Bananza is on track to be one of the most gorgeous Nintendo games I’ve seen,"" we wrote in ourDonkey Kong Bananza first hands-on preview. ""It really does take advantage of Switch 2's hardware — the environments are beautiful and DK’s animations are wonderfully expressive, and I left feeling like the next generation of first-party Nintendo games had truly arrived.""
Now that we finally have arelease dateandtech specson the highly anticipated Switch successor, Nintendo Switch 2 — as well as an idea ofhow much first-party Nintendo games may cost on the new system—check out our deep dive into all the facts as we talk to industry experts.
For more on Nintendo Switch 2, you can catch up oneverything shown at last week's Nintendo Direct. Donkey Kong Bananza comes out July 17 for $69.99, exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.

"FromSoftware has shared some more info about its recently announced Switch 2 exclusive,The Duskbloods. The partnership with Nintendo seemed to affect not just the style of game FromSoft is making, but even the design of the keeper of The Duskbloods' hub area into something different — something... cute.

The trailer shown during the Switch 2 Direct this week closed on a shot of a winged rat character, with glowing glyphs drawn all over it, looking at the camera. Curious fans might have wondered what this rat's deal was. As it turns out, this is our new hub companion.
""That character shares a similar role with the fire keepers from the Dark Souls series. They remain in the hub area, providing the player with advice and guidance,"" director Hidetaka Miyazaki saidin an interview with Nintendo.
""I suppose you could say we tried doing something a little Nintendo-esque in the spirit of the partnership.""
When asked what Miyazaki means by that, he added: ""We tried something cute for a change. Although I will say this character is actually an elderly gentleman (laughter).""
FromSoftware's shrine keepers have been central figures for player's journeys through their worlds. Familiar faces like Melina, the Maiden in Black, the Doll, and others are characters you return to over and over on your trip, often offering power to help you move forward.
With a PvPvE game like The Duskbloods, though, it remains to be seen what kind of advice and guidance the winged rat will offer. Miyazaki said the team at FromSoft has tried its hands at introducing ""a lot of new and interesting ideas,"" so expect the unexpected when it hits Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026.
We've got plenty more on The Duskbloods, includingBloodborne fan reaction, andMiyazaki's comments on whether FromSoft plans to leave single-player behind.
Meanwhile, if you're looking for more Switch 2 news,check out our first hands-on with Nintendo's newest console, its big launch titleMario Kart World, and the upcomingDonkey Kong Bananza.

"We recently saw a good look atPokémon Legends: Z-A, the next entry in Game Freak's Legends series set to take place in X and Y's Lumiose City. It's also apparently garnered an E10+ rating from the ESRB, and fans are both curious and wildly, sometimes jokingly, speculating about what's going to happen in this new entry.

Attentive fans noticed that on the Nintendo Switch store page, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has earned an E10+ age rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board, listing 'Fantasy Violence.' While it might not normally draw feverish speculation for most other series, it's an oddity for Pokémon, whose mainline games have consistently been 'E for Everyone.'
The rating has, of course, drawn wild speculation, some serious and some less-than-serious. It is genuinely entertaining to think about what strange choices Game Freak could possibly have made to bump up the rating, whether that bedialogue about Pokémon killing peopleor trying toadd a gunplay mechanic. Asseveral Redditors (jokingly) suggest, maybe the hordes come back, but it involves a group of Scrafty jumping you in one of Lumiose's alleys.
""Ohhhh boy, Game Freak is taking off the little kiddie gloves,""Reddit user RynnHamHamsaid. ""This ain’t your kindergartener’s Pokémon game.""
Several gags have also been made about AZ, a character with quite a history set to appear in Pokémon Legends: Z-A and who plays a central role in some of the darker elements of Pokémon X and Y's story and the history of the Kalos region.
As for more plausible speculation, there are a few theories, includinga few more""craps"" than usual, or the appearance of a Game Center-style minigame. Even the darker elements of Lumiose could be more front-and-center.
My personal take is that this probably lies in the 'Fantasy Violence' the ESRB highlighted. While the rating is an oddity for your typical Pokémon game, itdoesline up with the pocket monster fighting gamePokkén Tournament DX, which also received an E10+ and noted 'Fantasy Violence.' The real-time elementsshowcased for Pokémon Legends: Z-Acould have elicited the slightly stronger rating, as the monsters more clearly make contact.
There's no listing, as of this writing, for Pokémon Legends: Z-A on the ESRB site, so we can't learn much more at this time. Still, it's fun to speculate a bit, at least until we know more about Z-A's ultimate plans and how it will earn that bump-up in the E range.
Pokémon Legends: Z-A is slated for a late 2025 launch on Nintendo Switch.

"Nintendo has announced a Nintendo Direct focused on the Nintendo Switch.

The direct is set for 7am PT tomorrow, March 27, and will feature around 30 minutes of upcoming games for the Nintendo Switch.
Nintendo made a point of clarifying that there will be no updates about Nintendo Switch 2 during this presentation. Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct is set for 6am PT on April 2.
Tune in tomorrow, March 27th, at 7 a.m. PT for a livestreamed#NintendoDirect, featuring around 30 minutes of upcoming games for Nintendo Switch. There will be no updates about Nintendo Switch 2 during this presentation.Watch it here:https://t.co/sJFoxe0mq0pic.twitter.com/1XeAuff5o1
So, what should fans expect from this Nintendo Direct?Nintendo still has a number of upcoming Nintendo Switch games in the workseven as it prepares to release the Switch 2. It's worth remembering the Switch has sold an incredible 150.86 million units to date. That's an enormous audience video game publishers, developers, and Nintendo itself will find it hard to ignore even with so much attention on its successor.
To that end, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still down as a 2025 Switch game, as is Professor Layton and the New World of Steam. We know Pokemon Legends: Z-A is coming to the Switch at some point this year. When the hotly anticipated Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced six years ago, Team Cherry confirmed the launch platforms as Windows, Mac, Linux, and Nintendo Switch. Switch 2 is backwards compatible, so the expectation is all these games will work on the next-gen console as well as the OG Switch.
This week's Nintendo Direct may act as a last hurrah for the Switch eight years after it came out, outlining Nintendo's final slate of exclusives as it moves on to Switch 2. But perhaps Nintendo has a few surprises up its sleeve yet.

"Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition has hit its lowest price yet,now available for $49.99 at Amazon—its best deal to date, even beating Black Friday, according to our records, and even price-tracking siteCamelCamelCamel.

Originally released on October 8 forNintendo SwitchandPlayStation 4 (fully compatible with PS5), this collection brings together the first six mainline Final Fantasy games in their carefully remastered form. Square Enix has opted for refinement rather than reinvention, keeping the original pixelated aesthetic intact but sharpening it for modern displays.
The result is a collection that looks fantastic, whether on a massive TV or in handheld mode. The soundtrack has also received an orchestral upgrade, with legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu overseeing the new arrangements. On top of that, the package introduces a handful of thoughtful quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to disable random encounters and boost experience and gil gains—useful for those who want to focus on the story without the grind.
As a small but nostalgic extra, this edition includes a sticker sheet featuring 12 classic character sprites, including the Black Mage, a Moogle, Terra, Kain, and a mid-cackle Kefka. It’s not the most extravagant of bonuses, but it’s a fun little touch for fans of the series.
At its original $74.99 price, the collection was a tougher sell, but at $49.99, it's a much easier recommendation for anyone interested in the series’ origins. Whether you’re revisiting these classics or playing them for the first time, this is a well-executed remaster of six of themost influential RPGsever made. And with physical copies being the only collectible edition available, it might be worth picking up before they become harder to find, especially at this time.

"I've had a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription for little over a year now and it's been great. I've been able to play some older Game Boy Advance games I never got to experience as a kid as well as revisit classic N64 games like Banjo-Kazooie. Now with the Switch 2 on the horizon, the Switch Online subscription is goingto start including GameCube games– plus be required to use thenew GameChat function– and I couldn't be more excited. What I'm not excited about is the increased prices for the new console and games.

Theprice of the Switch 2 was revealedto be $449.99 and thenew Mario Kart game is going to cost $80at launch. These price increases make me think that a Nintendo Switch Online price increase is probably inevitable. If you are looking to pick up a subscription for the first time, there are still gift cards available at some retailers that you can purchase now instead of later. These are only available for new subscribers and do not stack upon existing subscriptions.
These gift cards are currently available at Walmart and Target, but sold out at Amazon. These are e-gift cards that will be sent to your email where you'll be able to add the subscription to your account via code. The 12 months don't start counting down until you actually access the membership, so there's some leeway about when you start it. If you redeemed the membership right now, you would still have access when the Switch 2 launches in June this year.
Although Nintendo has not mentioned anything about a price increase to any of theSwitch Online membership plansin the U.S., it seems likely that it will happen. Prices have already started toincrease in some regionsoutside of the U.S. in 2025 and with the Switch 2 looming, it's likely we will see the same thing occuring here.
The gift card we've featured above is specifically for an individual membership. Here's everything that has been confirmed to be included as we head into the Switch 2 era."
"Nintendo has announced the Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a special game launching alongside the Switch 2 to take you on a guided tour of its new hardware. Surprisingly, though, it's not a pack-in piece of software, but a separate, paid digital game.

Shown during today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is a ""virtual exhibition"" of the new hardware. Per Nintendo, ""through tech demos, minigames and other interactions, players will get to know the new system inside and out in ways they may never have known about otherwise.""
Today's Direct showed footage of a small player avatar exploring a super-sized Switch 2, reading about the different features and facts about the Nintendo Switch 2. It seems to act like a virtual museum of sorts, but also have some min-games like Speed Golf, Dodge the Spiked Balls, and a Maracas Physics Demo.
On stream and in a press release, Nintendo also confirmed the Switch 2 Welcome Tour will be available to buy from the Nintendo eShop on Switch 2's launch day.
While it's a neat tool,fans were quick to wonder whythis was a paid digital-only game and not a console pack-in for the Nintendo Switch 2. No price has been listed as of this writing.
For comparison, the Switch 2 is also launching with games like Mario Kart World, Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster, and Deltarune Chapters 1 through 4. While a showcase for the new console is certainly intriguing, it will be competing for some stretched wallets early on.
The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025at a $449.99 USD price tag, or $499.99 for the bundle including Mario Kart World.
To catch up on everything announced during today's stream,be sure to check out our recap of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct right here.

"As part of today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct presentation, we learned about how Nintendo Switch Online will work on the new console, including the news everyone's been waiting for: GameCube titles are on the way.

It's a major update to the Nintendo Switch Online library that will grant subscribers access to a laundry list of classic 2000s-era titles, including The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and Soulcalibur 2, which will all be available atlaunch this summer. Of course, this library will be expanded upon in the years to come, with some teased titles including Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, Super Mario Strikers, Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, and more.
The GameCube launch lineup arrives alongside the Switch 2 this June and will be available for those who subscribe to the Expansion Pack Nintendo Switch Online tier. If you're looking to make your trip down memory lane even more nostalgic, you can pick up the newly announced wireless GameCube controller for Switch 2. It comes with a C button and arrives on the My Nintendo Store the same day as the Switch 2's launch.
We've known for a while that Nintendo Switch Online would be present on Nintendo Switch 2, and fans have been hoping ever since that we would get upgrades to the retro offerings and other features. TheExpansion Pack for Nintendo Switch Online launched in 2021, to include N64 and Sega Genesis games, and thenexpanded again in 2023 to include GBA and GameBoy games, which gave fans hope that Nintendo DS and GameCube or other might be next. We've also been holding our breath for the ultimate result of theNintendo Switch Online Playtest Program from last fall, whichleaked immediately after it went live.
Thankfully, Switch 2 owners who subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online will continue to have access to the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries for the standard tier, as well as the Sega Genesis, Nitnendo 64, and Game Boy Advance libraries for the Expansion Pack tier. For everything else we saw at today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, check outour roundup.

"The Nintendo Switch 2 is finally hereand as previously reported the Switch 2 will be largely backwards compatible with Switch 1 games. However, there appears to be a concerted effort from Nintendo to introduce specially enhanced versions of Switch 1 games to the Switch 2. And these seem to go beyond just a graphical boost and framerate bump.

As Nintendo breaks down, there will be primarily three types of games playable on the Switch 2.Native Switch 2 gamesthat are developed for the system and cannot be played on the original Switch. Compatible Switch 1 games whose cartridges can slot right into the Switch 2 and be played natively on the console. And Switch 2 Edition games which are Switch 1 games that will receive new features and performance enhancements when played on Switch 2.
This doesn’t include classic games that are available through Nintendo Switch Online which includes a library of games from the NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and now GameCube.
The main takeaway from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is that Nintendo appears to be trying to throw in a little extra for anyone playing a Switch 2 Edition of a Switch 1 game.
For example, Super Mario Party Jamboree was a Switch game and the Switch 2 Edition will come with a new suite of content called Jamboree TV that will take advantage of the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, Switch 2 microphone, and the Switch 2 USB-C camera that will be sold separately.
Along with upgraded resolution up to 1440p in TV mode and better frame rate, there will be new minigames and online functions as well.
Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which will be a cross-gen game, will support mouse controls with Joy-Con 2, and multiple display modes like Quality Mode which runs at 60fps in 4K when docked, or 1080p at 60fps on handheld; or Performance Mode which runs a 120fps in 1080p when docked, or 120fps in 720p in handheld mode. All modes will support HDR.
Other Switch 2 Edition titles will get new story content like Kirby and the Forgotten Land’s Star-Crossed World add-on, whileThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdomwill gain additional support for the Zelda Notes service in the Nintendo Switch App that will give you guides and game help.
Some games, like Pokemon Legends: Z-A will only feature performance and resolution bumps as part of the Switch 2 Edition label.
The Switch 2 is set to be released on June 5, 2025 and that’s around when the first batch of Switch 2 Edition games will arrive.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will get Switch 2 Editions on the day of the console’s launch on June 5, 2025.
Switch 2 Editions for Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV will arrive a little later on July 24, 2025. Same for Kirby and the Forgotten Land’s update which will arrive on August 28, 2025.
Neither Metroid Prime 4: Beyond of Pokemon Legends: Z-A have release dates yet so both Switch 2 Editions are scheduled for sometime in 2025.
That depends. If you don’t own the Switch 1 version of the game, then you can purchase the Switch 2 Edition at retail, which will be distinct thanks to the new red-colored physical game case. The digital versions will also feature a prominent Switch 2 logo so you know you’re buying the right edition for your Switch 2.
If you own the game on Switch 1 and want the upgrades that will be added in the Switch 2 Edition you will need to purchase an upgrade pack from Nintendo. The upgrade packs will be available at select retailers, the official My Nintendo Store, and Nintendo eShop. However, Nintendo has not revealed how much an upgrade pack will cost just yet.
Some upgrade packs, like the upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom will be included in a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. This is the same membership that gives Switch owners access to online features and the classic library.
So there you have it, that’s everything you need to know about the Switch 2 Editions of a game. We’ve detailed previously how Nintendo is making thejump to the Switch 2 fairly seamlessthanks to its backward compatibility stance, and it looks like Nintendo is looking to bolster its launch library with improved versions of Switch classics.

"For a limited time, Amazon is offering the popularINIU 10,000mAh USB power bankfor just $8.99 after clipping the 10% off coupon on the product page and applying promo code ""4WJNEP2X"" during checkout. This is a new lower price than what we saw earlier this week. INIU power banks have solid reviews and are less expensive than equivalent Anker models.

This INIU power bank features a 10,000mAh (37Whr) capacity, which can charge a Nintendo Switch OLED from completely empty to full about 1.9 times, an iPhone 16 about 2.2 times, and an iPhone 16 Pro Max about 1.7 times. Note that this power bank doesn't have high speed Power Delivery, which means you're getting a maximum charging rate of about 15W. That's not quite fast enough to max out the charging rate of the iPhone or Switch (both cap at about 18-20W), it's not that much slower, and for $10 there's little reason to complain.
With a power bank this small, you don't need to worry about being stopped at airports. The 10,000mAh capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh carry-on limit. The INIU power bank is also slim and compact  so it's unlikely anyone will take notice in the first place. If a TSA official actually does take the initiative to test the wattage, you are well in the clear.

"Fans quick to celebrate the reveal of a Microsoft Flight Simulator PlayStation Store page were left let down after it was discovered that the actual product is little more than “copycat shovelware.”

Xbox and PlayStation fans gathered to discuss a potential port for the popular flight simulation game afterReddit user CreativeRaspberry314 sharedTrophy information related to a potential PS4 and PS5 version earlier today. It would be exciting – ifnot somewhat unsurprising– to see Microsoft bring more Xbox titles to PlayStation fans, butthe spotted store pageisn’t officially related to Microsoft Flight Simulator in any way, shape, or form.
“Sadly, this is just a copycat shovelware game,” oneReddit user added. “Straight up shovelware,” anotheradded. “Actually mental tbh, the picture is a straight up rip-off. If it was MSFS, it'd have the same achievements as the Xbox/Steam versions.”
Instead, the Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation is being published by a company named Grizzly Games Limited. As spotted byEurogamer, the company shares a name with Thronefall developer Grizzly Games but is also completely unrelated to that entity. While that team is responsible for other titles like Superflight and Islanders, theGrizzly Games Limited websitereveals a catalog of what appear to be mobile games featuring glossy, AI-generated materials. The art for its Flight Simulator 2025 project also appears to be generated by AI judging by some of its muddy plane parts and strange designs.
The Thronefall team, meanwhile, provided a statement to Eurogamer related to the discovery of Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation and Grizzly Games Limited. Grizzly Games says it is not associated with the company, adding that it is using “both our name and logo illegally.”
“Furthermore they seem to incorporate the absolute opposite of our values, of what we stand for and what we’re trying to give to the gaming community,” Grizzly Games continued. “Unfortunately our legal resources are limited as a two-person indie team, but honestly I'd love to see this kind of stuff being stopped, especially since it's not only happening to us but lots of indie devs that just lack the legal power.""
As of this story’s publication, the Flight Simulator 2025 page remains live on the PlayStation Store. It describes an experience that “sets a new standard in aviation simulation, combining ultra-realistic flight dynamics with breathtaking visuals.” No gameplay for the project has been revealed.
“Can shovelware just be banned from the store please? It’s packed to the brim with it and makes browsing an absolute chore,” anotherReddit user added. “I don’t remember it being this bad in prior generations.”
PlayStationtook a standagainst what many refer to as “spam” titles in 2022. At the time, it was believed the move was made to fight back against easy-to-Platinum games, or titles that exist almost solely for the purpose of increasing players’ Platinum Trophy count. However, many shovelware titles still exist on the PlayStation Store andother digital storefrontstoday.
Webrought a magnifying glass up to the issue last monthto take a closer look at how shovelware titles impact both gamers and developers. We spoke to multiple developers to learn more about not only how these games find their way onto digital storefronts but PlayStation, Nintendo, Xbox, and Valve’s vetting process.

"The globe-trotting World of Assassination trilogy of IO Interactive's Hitman series is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 asHitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition. And alongside arriving in the Switch 2 launch window, Agent 47 will also be donning some new, appropriately Nintendo-themed duds.

OnIO Interactive's site, the developer confirmed Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition will go up for pre-order soon, for both digital and physical editions. A pre-order of the digital edition will get you the Signature Pack, which includes two red-and-white outfits for Agent 47, a golden wrench, and a mushroom. Mushroom effects unknown at this time.
Physical pre-orders, meanwhile, offer both the Signature Pack and the Quack Pack, which offers a Luigi-themed green-and-grey suit and a green rubber duck. Much like a bald guy in a red tie and suit at a Paris fashion show, nothing unusual to see here.
Less-than-subtle references aside, it's fun to see Agent 47 get some Nintendo attire. Other games likeBayonettaandThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrimgot their own Nintendo crossover cosmetics, and Agent 47 certainly has earned a bit of Nintendo theming of his own.
The World of Assassination spans a trilogy of games, as Agent 47 undertakes a number of missions to assassinate targets and complete contracts for his clientele. Starting with 2016's Hitman, the WoA trilogy runs up through Hitman III, whichIGN gave a 9, saying: ""Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is one of the barcoded butcher's best appearances.""
Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition combines all of it together into one package. This includes the main campaign, contracts mode, escalations, Elusive Target arcades, and featured live content for Hitman, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3. Also included is the Freelancer game mode, a roguelike option for those who want even more variety and options in their Hitman experience.
Currently, Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition is due to arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in June 2025. Its also available now on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, the original Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation PS VR2.

"Toby Fox has been a busy guy. During today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, the small white dog dev showed the first full trailer for Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4, revealing that chapters 3 and 4 will launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5. It will also be available on all other platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.

Deltarune's first two chapters are mysterious little RPGs following a character named Kris through their adventures in a ""Dark World"" with their classmate Suzie and a prince named Ralsei. They borrow a number of characters and themes from Fox's previous work, Undertale, but thus far it's been unclear if there's any relationship between the two stories. Trailers lately have been referring to it as a ""parallel"" story to Undertale.
In today's trailer, we got our first-ever look at Chapters 3 and 4, though the look was cryptic as is Fox's wont. There was a brief look at the Castle Town with all the characters we've met so far hanging out together (including Queen!), a new battle that looked like some sort of rock show with Guitar Hero-like controls, Suzie throwing Kris into what looks like a chapel with both characters slightly off-color, and a look at two new villains. One, for Chapter 3, appears to be a creepy smile in a static-y TV (recalling the tease at the end of Chapter 2), and the other, a bit less comprehensibly, seems to be a pile of...weird jellyfish? That Suzie and Kris are running from? No idea.
Deltarune has thus far been released chapter by chapter, with chapter 1 coming out on Halloween 2018, and Chapter 2 debuting in September of 2021. Both of the first chapters were free. The total number of chapters is still unknown, but the menu screen has previously seemed to hold room for seven total, meainng that two more may be on the way. The anticipation for these latest chapters has only grown in the last year, withFox confirming last Halloween that 3 and 4would ""100% come out in 2025"". The Nintendo Switch 2 version will include all four chapters, including the two previously released.
Though we haven't yet reviewed the beginnings of Deltarune, we gave Fox's previous game, Undertale, arare 10/10, calling it a ""masterfully crafted experience.""

"Nintendo has announcedthe live-action The Legend of Zelda movielaunches on March 26, 2027.

Confirmation comes fromthe recently released Nintendo Today! app, which was unveiled during theNintendo Direct March 2025. No other information on the movie was revealed.
Video game legend Shigeru Miyamoto spilled the beans on the company’s latest news push as a last-minute stinger during the showcase. This all-in-one phone application comes with a variety of perks for die-hard Nintendo fans to be aware of.
This hub for all things Nintendo serves as a daily calendar and news machine to drip feed information directly to players as it happens. Miyamoto used the example that, after the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct premieres next week, fans will be able to log into the Nintendo Today app to catch all of the updates, with more news arriving “daily” from there.
But the big news has started early, with the Zelda movie release date confirmation sure to drive plenty of fans to download the app hoping for similarly seismic announcements in the days to come. It was telling that Nintendo's news app was first with the Zelda movie news, ahead of the company's own social media channels.
Nintendo and Sony Pictures first made the massive announcement about a live-action The Legend of Zelda movie in November 2023, with Wes Ball (The Maze Runner, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes) set to direct and Avi Arad and Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto producing.
We know next to nothing about the movie itself, though.Ball has said he wants it to be ""live action Miyazaki,""referencing beloved filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, the director of Studio Ghibli and creator of myriad anime classics such as My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle, and Spirited Away. Ball stillplans for the Zelda movie to be a ""serious"" adaptationthat feels real, and has made clearhe doesn't intend to use much motion capturein the ""grounded"" film.

"Nintendo has officially unveiled the Switch 2 in asuper-sized 60-minute Nintendo Direct. While preorders were originally set toopen on April 9 in the US, new tariffs led to aSwitch 2 preorder delay. When preorders will go live is still up in the air. However, Nintendo said the tariffs won't affect the Switch 2's launch date, which is still scheduled for June 5, 2025. Initially, Nintendo announced the upcomingconsole would cost $449.99alone, or $499.99 bundled with Mario Kart World (a game thatwill retail for $79.99if bought separately). However, the developing tariff situation will likely end up affecting the price, so a lot is still up in the air at the moment.

💥 Don't forget tobookmark our Switch 2 pre-order guidefor the latest updates & be the first to know about where you can buy the new Switch!💥
If you’re hoping to secure a Switch 2 on day one, you’ll want to act fast. Nintendo is offering aregistration system through My Nintendo Store, where invites to purchase will be sent out on a first-come, first-served basis. Priority will go to Nintendo Switch Online members with at least 12 months of paid membership and 50+ gameplay hours as of April 2, 2025.
All major retailers are also expected to open up preorders on April 9, 2025, as well. With demand expected to be high, here are some key tips from the IGN commerce team to improve your chances of getting a Switch 2 at launch.
Since the Switch 2 preodrer situation is still developing, news could break at any time. Plus, when a major piece of gaming hardware goes up for preorder at a retailer, there’s no telling how long it will be available. We’ve seen sought-after hardwaresell out in seconds. The best and most reliable way to know when a listing goes live is to followIGN Deals on XorBlueskyand keep an eye on those accounts in real time. (Wario64andCAGare also reliable sources of real-time information).
From now through the launch on June 5, 2025 and beyond, we’ll keep followers posted on any preorder news. And when preorders go live – whenever that happens to be – we'll post links the moment they become available.
There’s no point in clicking a live preorder link early if you’re not logged in. The precious seconds it takes to enter your login name and password could make the difference between you getting a Nintendo Switch 2 at launch and not. The retailers below are all likely to have Switch 2 preorders, so create an account if you have to, and make sure you’re logged in and ready before Switch 2 preorders go live.
The next step is to make sure your credit card info is entered in at the above retailers so you don’t have to type numbers with your excited fingers as everyone else on the planet buys a Switch 2 before you can.
With big ticket items like the Switch 2, the preorder links rarely go live at the same time across all the retailers. Often, Best Buy's link goes up first, followed a few minutes later by GameStop and Walmart. Amazon is usually the wild card of the bunch, sometimes going live hours (or even days) later. So if you miss the chance to preorder from one retailer, stay tuned to see if others will have Switch 2 preorders in stock a little later.
There's even a chance a given retailer will get additional preorders after its initial stock has run out. And even if you miss out preordering at all of the retailers, local brick-and-mortar stores may get stock on launch day. And failing that, even if stock is scarce at launch, Nintendo will catch up with demand at some point, so remain steadfast.
Anytime a hard-to-buy piece of gaming hardware goes up for preorder, out come the opportunists. You can bet shady sites and resellers on eBay will be primed and ready to capitalize on this moment. Some sites will make their original Switch stockseemlike Switch 2 stock. Others will take their actual Switch 2 preorders, crank the price sky high, and re-sell them at a massive profit. If you fail to secure a Switch 2 preorder at a legit retailer when they go live, please don’t pay large sums of money to these people looking to make an easy buck. It’s almost always better to wait until more stock becomes available at a site you trust.
In case you missed it, here's the full rundown of what wasannounced at the latest Nintendo Switch 2 Directon April 1st:

In retro news, I'm lighting a 30th birthday cake forIndiana Jones' Greatest Adventures, a SNES treasure that belongs in your museum. Developed by Factor 5 and published by JVC/LucasArts, this SNES gem took the tried-and-trueSuper Star Warsformula and applied it toRaiders of the Lost Ark,The Temple of Doom, andThe Last Crusade. With tight controls, detailed sprite work, and a John Williams-fueled chiptune soundtrack, this was a must-have for 16-bit adventurers.
Back in the day, it was pretty amazing stuff to become Indy as he punched, whipped, and jumped his way through jungles, temples, mines, and deserts—all while avoiding Nazis, cultists, and booby traps. The level variety was impressive, with bonus segments including mine cart chases, boulder dashes, and even some Mode7 dogfighting in a biplane.

"Nintendo Switch 2 features new game cards that come with a sleek new red look and faster data reading speeds.

Nintendo dived into the details on how physical game cards will work for its upcoming console during today’s special Switch 2 Direct. In addition to a first look at these updated game cards, the company detailed how additional storage will work.
The Switch 2 will only becompatible with microSD Express Cards, meaning you won’t be able to bring your old storage cards over when you pick up the console this summer. SanDisk has its128GB($44.99), and256GB MicroSD Express Cards($59.99) already available on Amazon.
No one was surprised to see Nintendo showcase how the Switch 2 ups the ante with new features and games, but we also got a good look at some of the controllers it will support. An updated pro controller is one of the new tools players can use to better enjoy the next generation of Nintendo gaming, as it comes with a variety of upgrades, including a C button located between the d-pad and right analog stick, GR and GL back bumper triggers, and an audio jack.
Today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct also cleared the air about how data transferring will work, with the company explaining that a new feature will allow original Switch owners to bring over their old save data, and digital games to Switch 2. For a better look at everything else Nintendo had to show during today’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, you can clickhere.

"Anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch will know about Joy-Con stick drift. It’s when the Joy-Con Control Sticks stop responding correctly, or suffer from ""drifting.""

Complaints aboutJoy-Con driftwere so loud that Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa apologized for the ""inconvenience"" and launched a free repair program. Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has talked about the ""battle against"" Joy-Con drift, insisting Nintendo was making continuous improvements. It was such a big problem that parents in the U.S. tried to sue over Joy-Con drift in a class-action lawsuit, although Nintendo ended up fending that off.
In 2022, a UK consumer group allegedNintendo Switch's Joy-Con drift issue was caused by a fundamental design flaw. A report from Which claimed that, even after just a few months of use, the Joy-Con's plastic circuit boards show significant wear on the joystick slider contact points,causing Joy-Con drift.
This week, Nintendo fully unveiled the $449.99 Switch 2 in a Nintendo Direct, showing off the new Joy-Con 2 and its extra functionality. InNintendo Switch 2 tech specspublished by the company, there is no detail on the sticks themselves. So as of now, we don’t know for sure if Joy-Con 2 use the hall effect sensors Nintendo fans are desperate for.
As Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto described in a new 'Ask the Developer' interview, the Switch 2's Joy-Cons have “larger and more durable” analog sticks “with smoother movement.”
It was a similarly vague response when Nintendo was asked about Joy-Con drift improvements at a hardware-focused roundtable Q&A in New York yesterday, attended by IGN.
Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, told the assembled media that the new Joy-Con 2 controllers were redesigned “from the ground up,” but failed to say anything specific about drifting.
“As you may have witnessed and felt, the new Joy-Con 2 controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been really designed from the ground up, from scratch, and they've been designed to have bigger movement and also smoother movement,” Sasaki said.
In the 'Ask the Developer' interview, Kawamoto talked about the new Switch 2 Pro Controller and its sticks, saying they’re ""quieter.""
“Aside from the color, the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller may look indistinguishable from the previous controller at first glance, but it was also redesigned from scratch,” Kawamoto explained.
“In particular, the left and right control sticks are quieter and don’t make noise, even when they’re moved quickly to the edge. Also, they glide very smoothly, so we've taken to calling them ‘smooth-gliding sticks.’ (Laughs)”
Sasaki added: ""As they’re calling them ‘smooth-gliding sticks,’ we made efforts to reduce the feeling of bumping when you tilt them. In fact, there's been a long-running project at Nintendo with the grand ambition of developing the ‘pinnacle of all controllers,’ and we’ve been researching it hard for a long time now.”
The proof of the pudding is in the eating, of course. We won’t know how the Switch 2 Joy-Con hold up under strain perhaps until years after the console comes out. But hopefully, based on what Nintendo is saying now, Joy-Con drift will be a thing of the past.

"Ever since Nintendo officially revealed the Switch 2, all eyes have been on the upcoming April Direct. That’s when we’ll presumably get an official Switch 2 release date, price, and confirmed line-up of games. So the last thing I was expecting was for Nintendo to dropanotherDirect the week before then, packed with big names like Pokémon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4. But maybe given Nintendo’s commitments to backward compatibility, I shouldn’t be too surprised.

Prior to this week’s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo was careful to temper expectations by declaring “There will be no updates about Nintendo Switch 2 during the presentation.” While that’s technically true – Switch 2 wasn’t mentioned apart from a reminder about the upcoming Direct and the new Virtual Game Card sharing system – it’s not a huge leap to say that everything we saw this week will be playable on the Switch 2, even if, officially, thesegames are coming to the original Switch.
It’s a win-win situation for everyone involved - those sticking with the OG Switch still have plenty to be excited about as the console enters its eighth year, and anyone upgrading to Switch 2 can do so safe in the knowledge it will have an extensive back catalogue of games right from the get-go.
Nintendo’s commitment to backward compatibility is contributing to what I think will be one of the smoothest transitions we’ve ever seen between console generations. Of course, most are excited to see what the Switch 2 can do and what new games are incoming, but byplaying it safe with the hardware, Nintendo has all bases covered. Based on the most recent Nintendo Direct, you wouldn’t think Nintendo is trying to sell as many Switch 2 pre-orders in the run-up to launch and convince people to upgrade. And that inclusive approach should be applauded. Nintendo is essentially saying everyone is welcome, whether you’re looking to buy a Switch 2 at launch, upgrade further down the line, or are content to keep the Switch you already own.
That’s why there was no risk in showcasing the multitude of Switch games less than a week before a dedicated Switch 2 Direct drops, even when just beneath the surface of the Direct Nintendo was putting down even more groundwork for the coming succession. I’m talking aboutthe Virtual Game Card system, which is an update that allows Switch owners to link two consoles together and share digital games. It’s a useful feature, especially with digital games sales on the rise, and it’s similar to the family sharing system Steam has. But why announce it at the very end of the Switch life cycle when the Switch 2 is literally weeks or months away? Presumably to make the transition to Switch 2 even smoother.
Some have pointed out that the fine print for the Virtual Game Card indicates the existence of a “Switch 2 Edition” for certain games. Whether that means there are exclusive enhancements to Switch 2 Edition games that make them unshareable with the older Switch, exclusive re-releases that will only work on Switch 2, or something else entirely, is still a mystery. But in the same way Nintendo said “Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported or fully compatible with Switch 2” when it was announced, this fine print likely covers Nintendo’s bases in the case of there being any unshareable games.
Whatever that fine print means, it feels like Nintendo is treating the road to Switch 2 almost like a procession, a bit like the way Apple moves from one iPhone to the next. You don’t have to upgrade but there are definitely benefits if you do, and you can bring whatever games you had before along for the ride.

"It feels like we've been speculating for years about what the specs of Nintendo's long-rumored Nintendo Switch upgrade might be. Now that we finally know, the results are a bit more impressive than many would have thought, including supporting 120fps and up to 4K resolution when the system is docked.

In a segment during today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo showed off a number of elements of the system. For starters, the Nintendo Switch 2 has a bigger built-in screen than the Switch 1, at 7.9 inches. It's the same thickness (13.9mm), but with about double the pixels, supporting a 1080p screen in handheld at up to 120fps. And it's an LCD screen, supporting HDR. Docked, it can support up to 4K resolution and HDR as well.
The Joy-Con 2 controllers are connected via magnets and detached by pressing a release button on the back. The SL and SR buttons on the side are bigger, so they're easier to play with horizontally, and the left and right sticks are also larger. And this segment officially revealed the mouse control support in the Joy-Con controllers, too.
The handheld Switch 2 has a built-in microphone with noise canceling technology and 3D audio for compatible games. And it has a larger, sturdier stand than the Nintendo Switch that can be adjustible to different heights. There's also top USB port that can be used for external camera connectivity, or to charge the system while in tabletop mode.
Finally, we learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage.
The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, and will cost $449.99 USD, or $499.99 if you buy a bundle with Mario Kart World. You can catch up on everything announced at the Nintendo Direct todayright here.

"Kirby’s racing spinoff Kirby Air Ride is making a tremendous comeback after more than 20 years, thanks to a new entry for Nintendo Switch 2:Kirby Air Riders.

The project made its grand debut during today’s special Switch 2 presentation, revealing a cast of colorful Kirbys and new spacey vehicles to travel with. No gameplay was revealed, with Nintendo instead choosing to reveal the project with a cinematic trailer and the promise of a 2025 release window. We likely won't have to wait too long to see how the sequel builds on the original GameCube game, but we can at least rest easy knowing Kirby creator and Super Smash Bros. mastermind Masahiro Sakurai is serving as the project's director.
You can see the Kirby Air Riders reveal trailer below.
Nintendo released its originalKirby Air Ridespinoff for GameCube players in 2003. It's an off-the-wall entry for the all-powerful pink hero that sees him trading out platforming challenges for fast-paced racing gameplay. It's unclear how exactly Kirby Air Riders will shake up the formula, but after more than two decades of waiting, Sakurai and his team will surely have plenty to reveal at a later date.
The last original new Kirby game was Kirby and the Forgotten Land for Nintendo Switch. This was Kirby's first adventure in a full 3D perspective, andwe gave it an 8/10. We said that it ""successfully warps the series’ already fun mix of ability-based combat, platforming, and secret hunting into the third dimension. The post-apocalyptic setting may not be as thematically interesting as Planet Popstar, but it is still lovely and vibrant, with cleverly designed levels that make consistently smart use of Kirby’s abilities.""
The Switch 2 is currently scheduled tolaunch June 5, 2025. You can catch up on everything announced at today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct righthere.

"As any younger sibling who grew up on Mario platformers knows, Luigi is gaming's ultimate Player 2. Nintendo's green-capped member of the Mario Bros. has lived a lifetime in the shadow of his older twin Mario, only stepping out for a taste of solo stardom in his ghostbusting Luigi's Mansion series.

As we move closer toSwitch 2, we’re celebrating another console generation of Luigi and Player 2s everywhere with a complete list of every Luigi game on Switch.
There are 17 games on Switch that let you play as Luigi. He’s the main character in only two games (Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD and Luigi’s Mansion 3) and the co-lead in one (Mario & Luigi: Brothership).
Luigi’s first starring role on Switch was inLuigi’s Mansion 3, the third entry in the character’s only solo series to date. Luigi’s Mansion 3 sees our timid hero and his green gooey clone team up with Professor E. Gadd to battle ghosts and save his friends from King Boo’s haunted hotel.
Luigi’s Mansion 2 HDis a remake of the 2013 Nintendo 3DS game Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon. This second game in the spooky series sees Luigi ghostbusting his way through the mansions of Evershade Valley to once again capture King Boo and save his brother.
Sure, it's not exclusively a 'Luigi game,' butMario & Luigi: Brothershipcertainly puts the brothers on even footing. Brothership is the first release in the Mario & Luigi series since Paper Jam in 2014. Players take on the role of both brothers, who must traverse puzzles and platforming challenges to restore the kingdom of Concordia.
The first Switch game to feature Luigi as a playable character wasMario Kart 8 Deluxe. Luigi appears as a middleweight racer with a well-balanced stat distribution that slightly favors speed and handling. His appearance in an ad for the original Wii U version of Mario Kart 8 spawned theLuigi Death Stare meme.
Luigi next appeared in the Nintendo-Ubisoft collaborationMario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. The tactical RPG features both Luigi and Rabbid Luigi, a Rabbid who dresses (and often behaves) like his human counterpart, as possible party members.
Luigi hit the court as one of 16 playable launch characters in 2018’sMario Tennis Aces. As is often true for Luigi in Mario sports games, he’s a balanced, “all-around” character in Aces. His specialty shot, Pipe Cannon, blasts him into the air to set him up for a powerful spike.
Luigi is one of 20 playable characters inSuper Mario Party. The younger of the Mario Bros. has appeared alongside his brother in every Mario Party game to date, including the two others further down this list. This is the first Mario Party game released for Switch and Nintendo’s ninth best-selling game on the platform,according to the company.
Luigi appears inSuper Smash Bros. Ultimateas an unlockable character. He is one of 12 characters to be playable in all five Smash games. According toLumiRank’s2025 tier list, which compiled the opinions of 93 ranked Smash players, Luigi is an A+-tier fighter and the 18th best overall.
Luigi is a playable character in the 2019 platformerNew Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe. This is an expanded version of NSMBU for Wii U that includes the expansion New Super Luigi U. Luigi stars as the main character in this expansion, which incorporates his higher jump, remixes levels from the base game, and adds a 100-second timer to each level.
Alongside Mario, Toad, and Toadette, Luigi is one of four playable characters inSuper Mario Maker 2. The level-building platformer allows players to create their own Mario levels using assets from Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, New Super Mario Bros. U, and Super Mario 3D World.
Like the original Wii U release,Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Furycan be played entirely as Luigi. Here, he controls similarly to Mario, albeit with a slightly higher jump and slightly less traction, making him play a bit more ‘floaty’ and ‘slippery’ than his red-capped counterpart.
Luigi hit the links with Mario and friends inMario Golf: Super Rush. One of 22 playable characters, he boasts decent control and excellent speed stats, making him a great option for Super Rush’s new Speed Golf mode. His special shot, Ice Flower Freeze, freezes the ground upon the ball’s impact, creating a hazardous area for opponents.
Luigi returns for the second iteration of Mario Party on Switch:Mario Party Superstars. Unlike Super Mario Party before it, Superstars is not an original game but rather a modern collection of minigames, boards, and mechanics from the series’ past.
Mario Strikers: Battle League Football, the latest Mario soccer/football game, features Luigi as one of 16 playable characters. Luigi is a well-balanced footballer who excels in technique, a skill that determines a character’s ability to dribble, curve their shot, and shoot accurately.
Luigi (and Rabbid Luigi) returned for Ubisoft and Nintendo’s tactical sequel,Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Luigi is labeled a Sneak Attacker due to his ranged weaponry and low health.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the latest 2D Mario platformer, features Luigi as a playable alternative to Mario. The difference between the two characters here is purely aesthetic, as the Mario Bros. play identically to one another.
Unsurprisingly, Luigi is playable inSuper Mario Party Jamboree, the biggest and arguably best game in Nintendo’s flagship party series. In addition to being a playable character, Luigi appears as part of Jamboree’s new Buddy mechanic, where he has the chance to change a player’s dice rolls from their initial numbers to 10s.
The next time you'll be able to play as Luigi is anew Mario Kart game, expected to release alongside theSwitch 2, that features double the usual amount of racers. Yes, that means24 racerson each track. Otherwise, I'm sure Mario will bring Luigi along for whatever his next adventure is. Plenty more games arerumoredto be releasing with Nintendo's next console generation, and the next updates will likely come out of aNintendo Direct scheduled for April 2.

"FromSoftware unveiled a new exclusive for Nintendo's new console during this week's Switch 2 Direct.The Duskbloodshad an ominous trailer, showing lots of action, horrors, and magic. In a new interview, we're now learning much more about FromSoft's plans for this multiplayer experience.

Nintendo posted athree-part interview serieswith The Duskbloods director Hidetaka Miyazaki, going over what The Duskbloods is, and how it's different from other FromSoftware games.
Despite the multiplayer PvPvE focus, Miyazaki has assured fans thatFromSoftware will keep making single-player focused games. But with The Duskbloods, the studio is experimenting, with everything from general game type tohaving a cute hub keeper.
Here are some of the major takeaways we've learned about The Duskbloods from this new set of interviews.
While the name, aesthetic, and constant mention of blood might bring to mindanother FromSoftware title, Miyazaki said The Duskbloods refers to the Bloodsworn themselves. These Bloodsworn—the characters players control—are people who have achieved superhuman abilities through special blood, similar to vampires.
""We tried to extract the sort of romantic aspects we found interesting from concepts such as vampires and 'blood' and reinterpreted them as the Bloodsworn,"" Miyazaki said.
The Duskblood is a collective term for these characters, who all partake in a bid for First Blood, which flows during an event known as the ""Twilight of Humanity.""
Because the Twilight of Humanity takes place across different times and locales, there is no ""fixed era or location"" to pin down when or where The Duskbloods takes place.
""There are more traditional Gothic- or Victorian-style maps as well as those depicting the closing years of the early modern period, like the one glimpsed in the trailer with the train running through it,"" Miyazaki said.
In a manner that sounds similar to the upcoming Elden Ring Nightreign, players can choose from ""over a dozen"" characters in The Duskbloods. Each character can also be customized, and you'll swap between those options in a main hub area.
While characters will each have their own abilities, it sounds like some skills are universal. The Bloodsworn fighters are essentially superhuman, so they can sprint, super jump, and double jump. Additionally, every character is equipped with ""some means of attacking from a distance,"" which Miyazaki said he feels is one of The Duskblood's ""unique aspects"" when compared with previous FromSoftware games.
A key component of The Duskbloods is the PvPvE set-up. Online matches support up to eight players, vying for a win. Miyazaki said online matches are ""generally"" last player standing, but there are ""certain cases where victory conditions differ."" He gave the example of players being tasked with teaming up to take down a powerful boss, or ""other special circumstances.""
""Regardless of whether it’s PvP or PvE, the idea is to provide players with an experience that allows them to learn and hone their skills as they play,"" Miyazaki said. ""We’ve therefore designed the PvE boss encounters to present a tough challenge and a sense of accomplishment upon defeating them.""
Obtaining ""Victory Points,"" which ultimately decide the outcome of a match, can happen in a few different ways. Direct combat is one, but engaging in more ""opportunistic behavior"" is also an option. And Miyazaki noted that when players return to the hub after a match, they receive a reward whether they won or lost.
There will be world events through the event system, which has the potential to shake up a match. This can range from special enemy spawns to additional objectives, all with bonus rewards offered.
Miyazaki drew attention to a portion of The Duskbloods trailer, where a giant stone face loomed in the sky. ""This is one example of the events that can occur in a match,"" Miyazaki said. ""In this case, the appearance of this stone face affects the environment and changes match rewards, which can have an immediate impact on player motivations and objectives.""
While First Blood is something worth chasing, Miyazaki said there will also be ""personal objectives"" to provide separate rewards for players.
It's unclear whether these fully tie into another system Miyazaki also mentioned, called ""roles."" While online, roles offer players unique circumstances and opportunities to interact with each other. He outlined a few examples, like the ""Destined Rival,"" which tasks a player with finding and defeating another player. Doing this will count as a personal goal, separate from the overall victory conditions.
Roles can be assigned to characters through customization, so players can roleplay a bit and, as Miyazaki said, add to the ""drama"" of these engagements.
FromSoftware is no stranger to putting some deep lore in its games. And there will, of course, be lore in The Duskbloods.
""One thing I love doing in any game I direct is leaving fragments of lore and worldbuilding details, allowing the player the fun of using their imagination to make connections,"" Miyazaki said. ""The Duskbloods is no exception to this.""
However, for The Duskbloods, Miyazaki said the team is going about it a little differently from previous games. Fragments are found in character customization items, the ""blood history and fate."" Customizing characters, analyzing and altering their blood history and fate, will reveal more information about the world and its story.
""Focusing these elements on the concept of 'blood' or 'blood history and fate' allowed for a deeper exploration of customization and is another reason we placed the Bloodsworn as the protagonists,"" Miyazaki said.
FromSoftware is certainly painting an interesting picture, but we'll have to wait a little bit to see the image fully realized, as The Duskbloods is currently planned to be a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive sometime in 2026.

"This is a guest column fromNintendo Life, the world’s most-visited independent Nintendo website. It covers the world of Nintendo from all angles: the games, hardware, and history with in-depth reviews and features, and also the fan community, culture, and conversation that’s formed around gaming’s most beloved company and characters.

For Nintendo fans the world over, time seems to be passing slower than ever. Sincethe January revealof Switch 2 (the official Nintendo one, notthe leaksweeks before) we've all been crossing days off the calendar counting down tothe April Nintendo Direct, when we'll finally get a proper deep dive at the hardware, a look at new games, and perhaps even a release date. Well, hopefully.
Ravenous as we are for solid Switch 2 details — ones that don't come from coverage-hungry case manufacturers or a 17-second peek of a newMario Kart— there's one I’m confident of: from day one, Switch 2 will be the ultimate Nintendo console.
I can already sense some '?' Blocks popping off but hear me out – even at this early stage it's hard to argue that Switch 2 won't be the ultimate portal for Nintendo games past, present, and future.
It's largely thanks to Nintendo Switch Online and the huge, historic catalogue steadily assembled sinceSeptember 2018. You get access to 182 games with a regular sub, or a whopping 290 with the 'Expansion Pack'. It’s not just Nintendo games either, the 47-strong selection ofSEGA Mega Drive/Genesis gamescovers some of that system's absolute best too. Plus the rubbishVirtua Fighter 2port.
Hey, they can't all be winners, but from classics to cult curios (seriously, check out the late-cycleSutte Hakkunfor Super Famicom if you haven't already), NSO is a vast buffet of historical video game nuggets served on a single handy device, a perfect introduction for younger gamers unfamiliar with the olden days. Grizzled vets can baulk at the idea of whippersnappers not having playedYoshi's IslandorOcarina of TimeorGoldenEye>Bunker>Power Weapons - no Oddjob, but time marches on and it's only natural. NSO's boon is offering so many iconic, formative games on a platter. We can debate the quality of the emulation (and we have), butthe library is impressive, despite gaps, and it's still growing.
That's all before we get to backwards compatibility with the current console; its lineup of series-bests should almost all be playable on the new Switch. Calls of recency bias will ring out for a generation or two yet, but the towering quality ofBreath of the Wildand its direct sequel Tears of the Kingdom,Super Mario OdysseyandSuper Mario Bros. Wonder,Animal Crossing: New Horizons,Splatoon 3,Pikmin 4, theMetroids, theXenoblades,and more is undeniable. If they're not the pinnacle of their respective series, they're in the conversation, and they'll all almost definitely be playable on Switch 2.
But what about third parties? What about indies?The specifics are hazy at this stage, but we're assuming that everything's coming over, so historians can still access Hamster's enormousArcade Archivesseries and Digital Eclipse's masterful work on various collections, not to mention its excellentGold Masterline.
The vast ocean of incredible indie games should speak for itself at this stage; one of Nintendo's greatest strengths this gen has been fully embracing the community of smaller devs. More surprisingly, Switch has also held its own with larger third-party devs, too, and signs point to that support expanding on Switch 2, and that includes games from other platform holders.
Switch isn't far off becoming a brilliantPlayStation history lesson, and even first-party Sony is starting to turn up withMLBandLEGO Horizon. Throw in potential support from Microsoft withCall of Dutyandrumours of other ports, plus the wider world of modern games and other firms eager to mitigate rising production costs across multiple platforms, and we're entering an era of unprecedented cross-platform support. Another win for anybody with a Switch 2.
There's also the small matter of whatever Nintendo's got bubbling on the stove in its Kyoto kitchens. Internal devs have been beavering away while partner studios have handled most first-party output since Mario Wonder. I'm expecting the biggest hitters on Nintendo's bench to come out swinging in April. A 3D Mario, naturally (it's the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros., remember), but anything except a full-blown 3D Zelda is possible. And there area couple of potential Wii U portsthat could tide us over nicely in the Hylian department, too.
Switch sales have slowed dramaticallyin the last year- not unexpectedly considering the system's age (it's going into itsninthyear in March). As any Captain F. Obvious can tell you, Nintendo needs the energy, excitement, and profit that new hardware generates, but day-one demand is likely to be colossal. Stockpiling inventory makes eminent sense, even ifanalysts, investors, and fans alikeare gagging for it ASAP.
Could the next mainline Mario be total toilet? Of course. Past evidence suggests it'll probably be quite good, though, and Switch 2 will likely have other quite good games. Nintendo's software batting average isquite good.
Even considering that history, though, Switch is the only console I remember buying on launch day. I got a Wii in its first month, but I'd never walked out of a store carrying the new hotness on the very first day before. It worked out rather well but a day-one purchase felt like a real gamble given the fate of Wii U, even for a card-carrying Nintendophile desperate to play BOTW on the bus.
Conversely,thisNintendo console feels like the surest possible bet for fans of the medium, even knowing practically nothing about its launch lineup. The historical library that took years to build up on previous systems is all just going to be there!
Well, almost all. As Nintendo hasmentioned(though not yet detailed), there will be""exceptions"". A background graphic on its website showsvarious games presumably playable; the likelihood is that onlyoutliersemploying peripherals and modes involving the IR sensor will be technically incompatible. Pour one out forLabo.
Beyond that, all signs point to Switch 2 being a brilliantly comprehensive overview of Nintendo history from launch day. Despite many unanswered questions, and not forgetting my professional obligation to get involved from the beginning (a golden excuse, granted), the possibility of buyer's remorse has never been lower for a Nintendo console. I've never been more eager to get stuck in on day one.
Whenever that is.

"There was aton of new info to take in from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. Luckily, we’ve picked out the most important details about the console, including when you can play it and the technology behind it, in this handy article. So, let’s get straight to it. Here are 23 new details about the Switch 2 console and its new GameChat feature.

1. Let’s start with the big one. We finally now know that theNintendo Switch 2 will arrive on June 5th, 2025.
2. It will beavailable to pre-orderon April 8th in the UK and Europe, but one day later on the 9th in the US.
3. The Switch 2 is a larger version of the original hybrid console, with the screen measuring 7.9 inches – a considerable increase compared to the Switch’s 6.2 inches.
4. The screen itself is a 1080p LCD monitor, with double the amount of pixels of the original screen. It also supports HDR (High Definition Range) and 120fps for an even smoother gameplay experience.
5.4K resolution will be available on Switch 2 when dockedand a suitable TV is connected via HDMI. The new dock also has a built-in fan this time around.
6. The Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage, a mammoth eight times the amount of space the original came with.
7. If you simply have too many games and need even more room, MicroSD Express cards are the only type that can be inserted for extra storage. Frustratingly, original Switch microSDs won’t work.
8.The Switch 2 will also be using a new type of game card. They’re red as opposed to their predecessor’s grey, and have a faster reading speed.
9. The audio capabilities of the Switch 2 appear significantly improved, with better quality speakers allowing for increased range, as well as 3D audio available when using headphones. Great, now we’ll be able to hear that blue shell coming for us directly from behind.
10. There’s also a built-in microphone on the top of the console that comes into its own when using the Switch 2’s brand-new GameChat feature (more on that later).
11. It also possesses two USB C ports. One on the bottom, just like the original Switch, and one on top to make charging easier when in tabletop mode, or if you want to take advantage of the new Nintendo Switch Camera 2 accessory.
12. The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera will be available on the same day as the console. It will cost  $49.99/£49.99 and can be used to put your face into games, such as Mario Party Jamboree, or as an overlay when playing with friends.
13. The Switch 2 joy-con connects magnetically to the console via the bigger, metallic SL and SR buttons, and also has larger analog sticks.
14.Each joy-con can also be used as a mouse too. Some examples of games that have were shown to use this functionality are Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Civilization 7.
15. A new Pro Controller will also be available for the Switch 2. It comes with programmable GL and GR buttons on the grips and will be available for $79.99/£74.99.
16. Other official accessories revealed at this time include Mario Kart steering wheels, a Switch 2 carry case, and an “all in one” carry case that can store and carry all equipment needed to play in TV mode. This includes the Nintendo Switch 2 system, Nintendo Switch 2 dock, Joy-Con 2 controllers, various cables, and up to six game cards.
17. Amiibo also make their return and are confirmed to be compatible with the Switch 2. Three new Street Fighter Amiibo – Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly – are due at the console’s launch.
18.The standard Nintendo Switch 2 console costs $449.99/£395.99and comes with the following in its box: A Nintendo Switch 2 console, Joy-Con 2 controllers (L+R), Joy-Con 2 Grip, Joy-Con 2 Straps, Nintendo Switch 2 Dock, Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable, Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter, and a USB-C Charging Cable.
19. A Mario Kart World Bundle will also be available at launch. It comes with all of the above, plus a copy of the game. This will cost $499.99/£429.99.
20. And finally, the big mystery of the Switch 2’s C button was finally solved.GameChat is a new party voice channel systemfor the Nintendo console that will allow players to talk to friends, and all begins with a press of that button.
21. The microphone on the top of the console promises to pick up players’ voices over the top of background noise, whether be busy traffic or a vacuum cleaner on the other side of the room.
22. It will also allow players to share their screens with others, much like PlayStation’s share screen tech, so that you can see what your friends are up to or even help them with a particular puzzle.
23. GameChat, of course, comes with a price, though. And that admission fee is a Nintendo Online membership. That will only be the case after March 31st, 2026, however, as before then it will be available to all Switch 2 owners for free.
And that’s all the quickfire information we picked out from Nintendo’s extensive Switch 2 Direct. Are you planning on picking up a Switch 2 at launch? Let us know in the comments. And for everything else Switch 2, stick with IGN.

"Nintendo just revealed so much about the Nintendo Switch 2 during its latest Direct, but we have learned even more since the hour-long presentation ended, including the new console's tech specs. While we still have a lot of questions, let's break down what's new with the Switch 2.

This had been touched on before, butNintendo reiteratedthat this new system will feature a 7.9-inch wide color gamut LCD screen that is capable of outputting at 1080p (1920x1080). This is a big upgrade from Switch 1's 6.2-inch screen, the Switch OLED's 7-inch screen (although we will miss OLED!), and the Switch Lite's 5.5-inch screen.
There is also support for HDR10 and VRR up to 120 Hz, which means games can jump up to 120fps if they and your setup allow it.
It was also confirmed that slotting the Switch 2 to its new dock will allow games to be played in 4K (3840x2160) at 60fps or 1080p/1440p (1920x1080/2560x1440) at 120fps. We know these higher-end graphics are made possible by a ""custom processor made by NVIDIA,"" but sadly we are currently given no further details in regard to Switch 2's CPU/GPU.
What was revealed, however, was the battery life. The Switch 2's internal battery is a Lithium-ion battery with 5220mAh, and this will allow for approximately 2 - 6.5 hours of battery life and a charge time of three hours when in Sleep mode. Nintendo noted these are ""rough estimates"" and that the ""battery life will depend on the games you play.""
This battery life is just about the same as the launch model Switch 1 as it boasted a range of 2.5 - 6.5 hours. On the other hand, the Switch 2's battery life is a downgrade from the three newer Switch models - Nintendo Switch (4.5 - 9 hours), Nintendo Switch - OLED Model (4.5 - 9 hours), and Nintendo Switch Lite (3 - 7 hours).
Elsewhere, we learn that the Switch is approximately 4.5 inches tall x 10.7 inches wide x .55 inches thick with the Joy-Con 2 attached. This translates to a weight of roughly .88 pounds without Joy-Con 2 and 1.18 lbs with them attached.
The weight of the Switch 2 is an exact match for the current Switch 1 model, but it is both taller and longer than any current model with Joy-Con attached;
Speaking of Joy-Con, we sadly don't get the confirmation that they are using Hall Effect joysticks that would likely preventthe drifting issues many Switch owners experienced.They very well may use them, asit was hinted at in a patent from 2023,but we'll have to wait to find out for sure.
On the audio front, the Switch 2 supports linear PCM output 5.1ch. If you want a surround sound effect, that can also be enabled via headphones of the built-in speaker after a system update.
For storage, the Switch 2 will feature 256 GB of internal storage, which is another upgrade from the 32 GB available on the Switch and Switch Lite and the 64 GB on the Switch - OLED Model. Another big difference here is that the Switch 2 will require microSD Express cards for up to 2TB of extra storage, meaning the microSDXC cards the current Switch models support will not be able to be transferred over to the new console.
To wrap up, it was also revealed the Switch 2 will support Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi 6), it will have 2 USB-C ports, a 3.5mm 4-contact stereo mini-plug (CTIA standard), and a built-in monaural microphone with noice cancellation, echo cancellation, and auto gain control.

"Nintendo revealed all of thejuicy details about the Switch 2during its April Direct. Theprice of the new consolewasn't too much of a surprise, but the reveal of the cost of first-party Switch 2 games at launch was definitely an eyebrow raiser. Most notably,Mario Kart World is going to cost $80on its own at launch. In addition to that, Nintendo is launching a new line of Switch 2 accessories that have gotten similar price increases compared to the original Switch.

The only Switch 2 accessory I was concerned about was the new Switch 2 Pro controller, which is now priced at a whopping $80. I already have multipleSwitch Pro controllersat home and would prefer not to  have to buy a new version. Thankfully, Nintendo confirmed in its developer interview that the original Switch Pro controllerwill be compatible with Switch 2.
While many folks will choose to opt for the newer Switch 2 Pro controller, it's not going to be necessary for most games. If you already have a Switch Pro controller, you should be fine holding onto that so you can save $80 to spend on new games. If you don't already have a Pro controller and are planning on buying the Switch 2, the standard Switch Pro controller is still a cheaper option right now at $69.99.
It's possible these older controllers could sell out before the Switch 2 arrives to make room for the newer controller. Amazon already has a signifcant lack of stock and is currently only offeringthird-party alternatives. Alongside compatiblity for the regular Switch Pro controller, Nintendo has also stated that the original Joy-Con controlllers will also be compatible – though we generallyrecommend the Switch Pro controller over Joy-Confor most games.
If the only accessory you really care about getting your hands on is the new Switch 2 Pro controller, you're going to have to wait until the console launches. The new controller will be officially available alongside the launch of the Switch 2 on June 5. You should be able topreorder the new console starting on April 9, which is likely when the official accessories will also become available for preorder. The Switch 2 Pro controller will only be compatible with the Switch 2, however, so you won't be able to use it on the standard Switch.
Listings for the Switch 2 Pro controller have already started to go live at Walmart and Best Buy, but with no preorder date shown. Walmart also includeslistings for the Switch 2 gamesyou'll be able to preorder soon.

"Nintendo has confirmed that those sleek new Switch 2 game cards won’t always carry an actual game and will, instead, sometimes simply contain a key for a game download.

The Super Mario Bros. company detailed how it will update its approach to physical game cartridges in acustomer support postpublished shortly after this morning’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. It explains that, when the Switch 2arrives this June, you’ll be able to carry on purchasing physical Switch games just as you’ve done for the last eight years, but there are a few things to keep in mind.
The post in question focuses on game-key cards: physical cards that only contain a key to download your chosen game. That means there’s no actual game data on the card you insert into your Switch 2, so you’ll need to download it once the card is inserted. Every game-key card case will be appropriately labeled on the lower portion of the front of the box, so if you’re concerned about what exactly you’re purchasing, you should have a heads-up right away.
News that Nintendo will utilize these game-key cards for Switch 2 has already taken hold of physical gaming fans who prefer the simplicity of plug-in-play without the need for lengthy download periods and an internet connection to get set up. The concern is that these are little more than fancy key holders that will soon replace all standard cartridges, but there are few reasons to believe this is actually the case for now.
Many have already taken to social media to point out that, while some early looks at Switch 2 box art, including covers for games likeStreet Fighter 6and theBravely Default remaster, do indeed feature that game-key card disclaimer, others, such asMario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananza, do not.
It appears the game-key card approach will likely be reserved for a few especially hefty games that might benefit from the key strategy, such as something like Hogwarts Legacy or Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Even then, developer CD Projekt Red hasalready confirmed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will ship with a game cardthat comes in at a whopping 64 GB on the Switch 2’s launch day.
Additionally, as explained during the Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo seems pretty proud ofthe new tech its upgraded red game cards support. They’re said to come with faster data reading speeds than what was seen with the original hybrid console from 2017, a fact the company wouldn’t need to point out if all of its cartridges were simple key containers. Let's not forget that Nintendo has bent the definition of what a game card offers before, with some notable original Switch examples beingLA NoireandNBA 2K18, which both required additional downloads out of the box.
It’s far too soon to tell just how many Switch 2 games will rely on game-key cards, but we know all will be revealed as launch draws closer. For now, the Nintendo Switch 2 is primed to click into action come June 5, 2025. For everything revealed during today’s all-encompassing Direct, clickhere.

"As Nintendo had teased, Nvidia has now discussed the custom GPU powering the Nintendo Switch 2, although it failed to go into the level of detail tech enthusiasts were hoping for.

In ablog post, Nvidia confirmed what IGN had reported earlier today from Nintendo itself: that its GPU enables AI upscaling via DLSS and ray tracing.
Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is an AI-powered technology that uses machine learning to upscale lower-resolution images in real-time, enhancing both performance and image quality in games.
There is a little more detail on offer here on the Switch 2’s GPU. Nvidia described it as a “custom Nvidia processor featuring an Nvidia GPU with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements.”
Nvidia continued: “With 1,000 engineer-years of effort across every element — from system and chip design to a custom GPU, APIs and world-class development tools — the Nintendo Switch 2 brings major upgrades.”
Those upgrades include up to 4K gaming in TV mode and up to 120 FPS at 1080p in handheld mode. Nintendo Switch 2 also supports HDR, and AI upscaling “to sharpen visuals and smooth gameplay.”
The new RT Cores bring real-time ray tracing, delivering “lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows for more immersive worlds,” Nvidia continued.
Tensor Cores, meanwhile, power AI-driven features like DLSS, “boosting resolution for sharper details without sacrificing image quality.”
Interestingly, Nvidia said the Tensor Cores also enable AI-powered face tracking and background removal in video chat use cases, “enhancing social gaming and streaming.”
During the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed the C button, which is used for new chat functionality that incorporates an external camera and the microphone in the Switch 2 itself. Nintendo made a point of saying the tech is smart enough to pay attention to the player’s voice and filter out background noise.
And here’s the big claim from Nvidia:
“With 10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2 delivers smoother gameplay and sharper visuals.”
There’s no detail on how it’s determined that graphics performance. It will no doubt be left to experts such asDigital Foundryto run the numbers once the Switch 2 launches in June.
Elsewhere, Nvidia said the Tensor Cores “boost AI-powered graphics while keeping power consumption efficient,” and the RT Cores “enhance in-game realism with dynamic lighting and natural reflections.”
Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) via Nvidia G-SYNC in handheld mode “ensures ultra-smooth, tear-free gameplay.”
In a hardware-focused roundtable Q&A in New York yesterday, attended by IGN,Nintendo representatives confirmed the Switch 2 uses DLSS, but did not specify which version of the tech, or whether it had been customized for Switch 2. It was a similarly vague response when Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2’s GPU is capable of ray tracing.
And what about the GPU itself? Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, chimed in to say Nintendo prefers not to get in the weeds on things like the GPU.
“Nintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec,” he said. “What we really like to focus on is the value that we can provide to our consumers. But I do believe that our partner Nvidia will be sharing some information.”
In January, the internet spotted a patent, filed July 2023 but published for the first time earlier this year,that described AI image upscaling technologythat would help keep video game download sizes small enough to fit on a physical game cartridge while offering up to 4K textures.

"One of my main frustrations with playing the Nintendo Switch in handheld mode is how uncomfortable it gets. The Joy-Con controllers that come with the Switch are great in a pinch, but they just weren't built for longer gaming sessions. I love theNintendo Switch Pro controllerfor playing games on my TV, but whenever I play on the go I use the Nitro Deck.

I purchased my CRKD Nitro Deckduring Prime Day last yearwhen it dropped in price, but Amazon has just discounted the price on the white model even further. Right now, you can pick up this great Switch accessory for 24% off its normal price.
Multiple colors of the Nitro Deck are currently on sale, but only the white versionhas dropped to its lowest-ever price. You can purchase the black, gray, blue, and pink versions for just $2 more. There are also various special editions that are quite a bit more expensive that are discounted.
The selling point of the Nitro Deck is comfort. The grips fit my hands wonderfully, and the controller itself includes gyro compatibility and rumble support. There's also a convenient kickstand that lets you set your Switch upright on a flat surface. Unlike some Joy-Con, the joysticks offer zero stick drift. You can also remap the buttons if you want to take customization further.
See more design options:
IGN had the chance to review this controller back in 2023. Here's a quick snippet of what we said in ourhands-on CRKD Nitro Deck review:
""For many, simply having a solution to the Nintendo Switch’s infamous stick drift is enough to warrant an upgrade to the Nitro Deck, especially when factoring in that the entire unit is less than the cost of a new pair of Joy-Con controllers. However, the upside gained with a more durable shell, customizable back buttons, better ergonomics for handheld play, and a sturdier kickstand makes the Nitro Deck an easy recommendation for hardcore and casual gamers as it makes your Nintendo Switch feel practically like a new console. The added heft and weight certainly take getting used to compared to the stock Nintendo Switch, but the upgraded experience it provides in nearly every way is well worth your time.""
Now that we know the Nintendo Switch 2 is coming out later this year, you may be wondering if this particularSwitch accessorywill be compatible with the new hardware. The answer is no. TheSwitch 2 will be largerthan the standard Switch, so the Nitro Deck will not be compatible with it. You will only be able to use it with the standard Switch model and the Nintendo Switch OLED.

"Here's our first look at Nintendo's newly designedNintendo Switch 2game boxes.

While the OG Nintendo Switch's game covers simply boasted a small Nintendo Switch logo in the top left-hand corner, the Switch 2's branding is far more prominent, with a red band stretching across the entire width of the case and a larger Nintendo Switch 2 logo.
There's also a change for Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives, too. While Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive game covers don't have any further information or branding on them, covers for games playable on both the original and Switch 2 systems all include a clear statement about Switch 2's upgrade information.
For instance, The Nintendo Switch 2 edition ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wildincludes the text: ""Includes the Nintendo Switch game and the Nintendo Switch upgrade pack. Upgrade pack also available separately.""
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games,some of which cost $79.99, clearly mark the boxes as such to let buyers know what they're getting.
You can see the new designs for yourself in the slideshow below:
There's now also a QR code on the bottom right of all game covers that takes you swiftly to the official Nintendo website.
At last, theNintendo Switch 2 has a release date. It's coming on June 5, 2025, with prices starting at $449.99. A bundle is also available withMario Kart Worldincluded for $499.99, although if you want to buy Nintendo's signature racer separately,it's $79.99.

"Both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are getting Nintendo Switch 2 versions for the new console. Alongside the in-game upgrades, Nintendo's adding a number of additional features through the new Zelda Notes option in its Nintendo Switch App, including achievements.

The Nintendo Switch App (formerly known as the Nintendo Switch Online App) will get an update adding Zelda Notes, a game-specific service exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 versions of both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.
This app wasshown off in the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, allowing players to use GPS-style navigation to reach landmarks in the Zelda games. For achievements, the app will track your play data and allow players to earn in-app medals based on their records. These account for opening chests, earning rupees, and more.
In the Achievements section, Nintendo lists categories such as ""Quests and Adventures Cleared,"" ""Shrines of Light Cleared,"" ""Locations Visited,"" ""Lightroots Unlocked,"" and others. Alongside tracking those numbers, the app will also let you see how you match up with other players on a global scale.
While the achievements seem geared towards completion, it's interesting to see Nintendo experiment with these options. Granted, they exist in a phone app rather than on the Switch 2 console by itself, but I am curious to see whether other games get similar treatments in the future.
Other features of the Zelda Notes app include a Daily Bonus option for helpful resources, a Voice Memories section which adds more story and lore to the world as you explore, and an Autobuild Sharing tool. These do seem like handy tools, and especially geared towards people playing through this Zelda duology for the second time on their Nintendo Switch 2.
The Nintendo Switch 2 has a launch date set for June 5, 2025. Both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom will have Switch 2 editions at launch, alongside a slew of other games both new and refreshed. Previews dropped this morning for some of the launch window games for the Nintendo Switch 2, includingMario Kart World,Donkey Kong Bananza, andgeneral hands-on impressions of the console.

"Nintendo has finally given usall the info on its new console, the Switch 2. During the hour-long Direct, there was a LOT of info on both new and old games coming toNintendo’s new console. From expected arrivals such as Mario Kart World to the complete surprise of what looks like a spiritual sequel to Bloodborne, here are 72 new details about the Nintendo Switch 2 games library as we know it right now.

1. The Switch 2’s flagship launch title looks set to be Mario Kart World, the first open-world Mario Kart game that will allow you to “drive almost anywhere”.
2. Many new tracks were seen in the trailer, including one based on the original Donkey Kong game and a metropolis that could be Super Mario Odyssey’s New Donk City.
3. The overworld’s roads and track conditions will change due to the environment’s changing weather and a day/night cycle.
4. Up to 24 drivers in a race were confirmed, almost certainly leading to even more Mario Kart havoc.
5. A new mode for Mario Kart World called Knockout Tour will be introduced. These will be longer races where you follow the checkpoints and have to remain near the leaders to avoid elimination and ultimately take the crown.
6. You can also drive freely around the open world and meet up with friends. A photo mode will help document these adventures.
7. New racing mechanics look set to be introduced. We see wall-riding and grinding in the trailer, as well as what looks like Birdo transforming into a semi-truck and Mario eating a burger to transform into a different version of himself? I’m sure we’ll find out what the hell is going on here soon enough.
8. And that time could be 6am Pacific Time on the 17th of April, when Mario Kart World will be having its very own Nintendo Direct stream.
9. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be getting its very own Switch 2 version, which allows you to take advantage of the new joy-con mouse controls.
10. Metroid Prime 4 will also be available to play in two different graphics modes. Quality Mode allows for  4K 60FPS with HDR enabled when docked and 1080p 60fps handheld. Performance Mode offers 1080p with HDR at 120fps docked, but 720p 120fps HDR when handheld.
11. A new 3D Donkey Kong platformer called Donkey Kong Bananza is heading to the Switch 2 on July 17th. It appears we’ll be able to smash everything in it.
12. Kirby Air Riders, a follow-up to GameCube racing spin-off Kirby Air Ride, is also coming to the Switch 2. It will be directed by legendary Super Smash Bros. developer, and Kirby creator, Masahiro Sakurai.
13. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour will offer a “virtual exhibition” of the new hardware, as well as being filled with minigames. This will not be packed into each Switch 2 at launch, though, but a paid-for game in its own right.
14. Drag X Drive is a launch game that uses the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con mouse controls to enable three-on-three basketball-style matches.
15. Then there are a bunch of existing Nintendo-published games that will be getting Switch 2 upgrades. These won’t be free for existing owners, however, with paid upgrade packs being the barrier to entry. The list of Switch 1 games getting these upgrades so far includes:
16. Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV, the latter being an expansion centered around the Switch 2 camera and GameChat additions.
17. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, with both receiving enhanced resolution and frame rates, as well as HDR implementation. A new Zelda Notes section on the Nintendo Today app will also be added to let you look at Hyrule’s map and easily share TOTK creations with other players.
18. Kirby and the Forgotten Land will be receiving an upgrade, as well as a new Star Cross World story expansion.
19. And Pokemon Legends Z-A will get its very own Switch 2 version with enhanced resolution when it arrives later in 2025.
20. But that’s not it. During the Switch 2 direct a whole host of third-party games, both new and old, were revealed to be making their way to Nintendo’s upcoming console. We’ve got them all for you here:
21. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the whole direct, FromSoftware is making what looks like a spiritual successor to Bloodborne exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2. Releasing in 2026, The Duskbloods is officially described as “a brand-new multiplayer game"" from the Dark Souls developers and we look forward to hearing much more about it when a Creator’s Voice article from Hidetaka Miyazaki himself drops on the Nintendo Today App on April 4th.
22. FromSoft’s last game, Elden Ring, will also be making its way to Switch 2 with its Tarnished Edition.
23. Hades 2 will arrive (presumably once out of early access)
24. We finally got another little peek at Hollow Knight Silksong, which is listed for 2025.
25. Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition will be available on day one.
26. Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion will launch on September 5th.
27. Split-Fiction will also arrive at launch.
28. Both the EA FC and Madden sports sims will be on Switch 2.
29. Hogwarts Legacy, complete with mouse controls, will be available at launch.
30. The Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 Remakes will arrive in summer, as well as what looked like a tease for a Spongebob level (?)
31. The Hitman World of Assassination Signature Edition will let us carry out contracts on the go.
32. James Bond will make his way to Switch 2 when Project 007 is released by IO Interactive.
33. A Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster will launch alongside the Switch 2.

36. Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4 are also set for launch day.
37. And Borderlands 4 will fire its way onto Switch 2 alongside its thousands of different ridiculous pieces of weaponry.
38. Civilization 7 will be taking advantage of the Switch 2’s mouse controls at launch.
39. And both WWE 2K and NBA 2K will both be making their way to the console as well.
40. Survival Kids, a colourful co-op survival game, will be arriving at launch, too.
41. Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition is on the way from CD Projekt Red, complete with its Phantom Liberty expansion.
42. And Square Enix will also be bringing Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade to Switch 2 in all its glory.
43. There were also MANY more games shown to be on their way to the Switch 2. Let’s rattle them off here, starting with Enter the Gungeon 2.

67. There will be three titles at launch, including The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. Yeah, it’s not the HD remaster that many have been crying out for but at least it’s a way of replaying the fantastic GameCube adventure on the go.

"Mario Kart Worldwill launch with at least 60 different playable characters and outfits when it releases on June 5th, 2025.

We recently got hands-on time with the Switch 2 launch game, and you cancheck out our impressions of Mario Kart World here. As part of playing it, we got a good look at the character select screens and noted down all of the starting drivers and the alternate looks for each. Here they are:
Quite the list! Looks like we'll be doing a lot of racing (and throwing food around?) when Mario Kart World launches alongside the Nintendo Switch 2. Although impressions are positive around the look and open-world ambitions the game,questions have been raised around its $80 price tag.

"Nintendo has confirmed some of its Switch 2 game sizes, and, thankfully, they’re relatively small.

The Japanese My Nintendo Store lists a number of Switch 2 games alongside their file sizes.
The Nintendo Switch 2 features 256 GB of internal storage, which is a significant upgrade on the 32 GB available on the OG Switch and Switch Lite and the 64 GB on the Switch - OLED Model.
Another big difference is that the Switch 2 requires microSD Express cards for up to 2 TB of extra storage, meaning the microSDXC cards the current Switch models support cannot transfer over to the new console.
But, based on the file sizes revealed on the Japanese store, that 256 GB of internal storage should keep most players going for a while.
The biggest file size here is, as you’d expect, Mario Kart World, but at 23.4 GB it only takes up around 10% of the Switch 2’s total internal storage.
Mario Kart World is relatively slim compared tothe beefy Cyberpunk 2077, which weighs in at 64 GB on Nintendo Switch 2. That's a chunky 25% of the Switch 2’s internal storage.
Nintendo also recently confirmed that several newSwitch 2 game cards won’t always carry an actual game, but instead contain a key for a game download. This isn't the case for Cyberpunk 2077, though.
For context, one of the biggest games on the original Switch, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was just 16 GB.
It’s worth noting that the GameCube app’s size is expected to grow as new games are added to the library. At launch, the GameCube app contains The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and SoulCalibur 2.
So, how is the Nintendo Switch 2 able to get away with relatively small game sizes while offering up to 4K resolution?
In January, the internet spotted a Nintendo patent, filed July 2023 but published for the first time earlier this year,that described AI image upscaling technologythat would help keep video game download sizes small enough to fit on a physical game cartridge while offering up to 4K textures. It was thought at the time that this applied to the Nintendo Switch 2, and could relate to Nvidia DLSS graphics technology.
Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is an AI-powered technology that uses machine learning to upscale lower-resolution images in real-time, enhancing both performance and image quality in games.
This week, in the wake of the Nintendo Direct,Nintendo and Nvidia confirmed the Switch 2’s custom GPU enables AI upscaling via DLSS and ray tracing.
Nvidia described it as a “custom Nvidia processor featuring an Nvidia GPU with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements.”
Those upgrades include up to 4K gaming in TV mode and up to 120 FPS at 1080p in handheld mode. Nintendo Switch 2 also supports HDR, and AI upscaling “to sharpen visuals and smooth gameplay.”
The new RT Cores bring real-time ray tracing, delivering “lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows for more immersive worlds,” Nvidia continued.
Tensor Cores, meanwhile, power AI-driven features like DLSS, “boosting resolution for sharper details without sacrificing image quality.”
Details are thin on the ground, however. In a hardware-focused roundtable Q&A in New York this week, attended by IGN,Nintendo representatives confirmed the Switch 2 uses DLSS, but did not specify which version of the tech, or whether it had been customized for Switch 2. It was a similarly vague response when Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2’s GPU is capable of ray tracing.
And what about the GPU itself? Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, chimed in to say Nintendo prefers not to get in the weeds on things like the GPU.
“Nintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec,” he said. “What we really like to focus on is the value that we can provide to our consumers. But I do believe that our partner Nvidia will be sharing some information.”

"GameCube games coming exclusively to the Switch 2'sexclusive online library is one of the best features of the new console. To make those membership costs just that little bit easier, UK retailerShopTohas NSO at 35% off right now, and there's an extra 5% when you use code SPRING at checkout. As you get yourNintendo Switch 2 preordersin, this is an absolute bonus bargain to consider.

While some Nintendo Classics catalogues are unlocked with the base online subscription, you'll also need the Expansion Pack to play GameCube titles on Nintendo Switch 2. What's more, while you can subscribe to a monthly model for just Nintendo Switch Online, the Expansion Pack is only available on the 12-month plan, so make a note when purchasing.
Currently, the individual versions of these combined 12-month subscriptions cost either £34.99 on the Nintendo eShop or £39.99 at retailers like ShopTo. But now, it seems like ShopTo are keen to get on the Switch 2 hype by slashing £14.14 off the individual plan and £15.14 off the family plans respectively.
So, if you're the only Nintendo Switch players in your household, you can buy theindividual Online + Expansion Pack plan for £24.55or theFamily Membership for £43.55with the promo code SPRING.
Overall, the family version is fantastic value as you can have up to eight Nintendo Accounts under a Family Group sharing the same membership, and you don't have to be in the same household either.
Under ShopTo's new price, that's as low as £5.60 per person getting to enjoy Nintendo Switch Online and the entire Expansion Pack's catalogue of games—including GameCube gemsPokemon XD: Gale of Darkness,Soulcalibur 2, andThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker— for a whole year.
If you're like me, though, and have already have a basic Nintendo Switch Online membership active until next year, the only way to upgrade is through Nintendo themselves—either on their website or the eShop—without a direct discount from retailers like ShopTo.
However, a way to get around that is by purchasingdiscounted digital Nintendo eShop gift cards from Currys. Buy entering the code ""NINTENDODIGITAL10"" at checkout, you'll get 10% off on£15,£25,£50,£75, and£100amounts of eShop credit—saving you as much as £10.
In the case of upgrading your 12-month Nintendo Switch Online membership, the cost of which varies depending on how much is left, you can buy the closest amount you need or a larger amount at a bigger discount, and use any extra credit you have on digital games or save it to put toward your subscription next year.

"TheNintendo Switch 2has finally been revealed, and while it brings huge improvements over the original console, it doesn’t exist in the same vacuum that the original handheld did. With the introduction of devices like theSteam DeckandAsus ROG Ally X, a ton of handheld gaming systems out there can play AAA PC games on the go.

So, while the Switch 2 will automatically have a niche carved out for being a system that plays, well, Nintendo games likeMario Kart World,anyone that’s buying a Switch 2 to play multiplatform games will have to reckon with devices like the Steam Deck – especially with the Switch 2’s $449 price tag.
Now that Nintendo has given a sneak peek into the hardware that’s running its new console, we can take a look at how exactly it will run, and whether or not its 4K promises are more than empty words.
The SoC (System on a Chip) that runs the Nintendo Switch 2 is probably the most important part of the console, but it’s the thing we know the least about. We do know that it’s a “custom Nvidia processor” thatsupports DLSS and ray tracing, but beyond that, neither Nintendo nor Nvidia have revealed any specifics. Luckily, there are a ton of leaks that suggest the Nintendo Switch 2 is using the aging Ampere graphics architecture behind theRTX 3080.
Going all the way back to 2023, there wereleaks suggesting that the Nintendo Switch 2 would be using the Nvidia Tegra T239 SoC. This APU uses 8 ARM A78C cores, combined with an Nvidia Ampere GPU with 1,536 CUDA cores. Napkin math puts that at 12 Streaming Multiprocessors, which would be significantly smaller than even the smallest Ampere GPU – the RTX 3050 for laptops. However, assuming Nvidia didn’t nerf the Ampere SMs in the T239, each SM would have four Tensor Cores and an RT core, making for a total of 48 and 12, respectively.
To be fair, the Steam Deck is using a custom AMD APU that’s built on 8 AMD RDNA 2 GPU cores, which is smaller than what Nintendo is offering here. But, you have to keep in mind that the Steam Deck has a lower resolution display, and pumps more power into it. Plus,AMD Z2 processorsare coming out over the next year, with the Z2 Extreme featuring 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, which will be a huge upgrade. Though, systems with that chipset are going to bemuchmore expensive than the Switch 2.
That small of a GPU basically makes 4K gaming an impossibility natively, but because the Tensor Cores are there, DLSS is going to be a major factor in how the Nintendo Switch performs when docked – assuming this is the SoC that’s actually in the system. However, with so few Tensor Cores, even upscaling to 4K is going to be a stretch in everything but the most lightweight games.
Instead, most games are likely going to target 1080p, even if they don’t natively render at that resolution. There are games like Donkey Kong Bananza that do seem to be rendering at a native 1080p resolution, according toDigital Foundry’s hands-on demos. However, third-party games like Cyberpunk 2077 seem to be relying heavily on upscaling, with native resolutions as low as 540p. I wouldn’t expect the Nintendo Switch 2 to ever be able to handle Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K, even with DLSS, though Nintendo will definitely have better luck with any game it can get running natively at 1080p.
The Ampere cores in the rumored T239 also have RT cores, which should theoretically allow for ray tracing in Nintendo Switch 2 games. Though, again, this will be heavily constrained by the processor’s 12 RT cores. Ray tracing will be possible, but don’t expect any jaw-dropping implementations of the technology, and especially don’t expect it in games likeCyberpunk 2077.
Even with RT cores, ray tracing is an extremely expensive workload for the GPU, and the T239 is limited by more than just its small SM count – power is a huge limiting factor, too. I spoke withRichard Leadbetter over at Digital Foundry, who told me that the entire system likely consumes as little as 10W, including the display, the SoC, and the mainboard. We won’t know exactly what the T239’s actual TDP (thermal design power) is until someone finds a way to measure it, but it likely leaves only 5-6W for the SoC itself – a third of the power of the Steam Deck’s AMD APU.
However, while the Nintendo Switch 2 might not be able to produce the same amount of power as ahandheld gaming PClike the Asus ROG Ally X, that doesn’t mean there won’t be gorgeous games running on the system. After all, games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza look stunning, and it goes to show how clever Nintendo developers are at getting the most out of the hardware in the Switch.
After all, the original Nintendo Switch was powered by the Nvidia Tegra X1, which was built on thenow-ancient Maxwell graphics architectureand only packed 256 CUDA cores. Ampere is orders of magnitude more efficient than Maxwell even on its best days, and there are six times more cores in the Switch 2’s GPU. The Nintendo Switch 2 should bewayfaster than the original console, which bodes well for cross-generation ports like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
While a total system power budget of 10W means the system isn’t quite as fast as it could be, it does mean the battery will have a much better time keeping up. Nintendo has come out and said it should last around 2 hours at a minimum. That’s less than was quoted for the original Switch, but that shouldn’t be too surprising, due to its higher-resolution display and more powerful processor.
The Nintendo Switch 2 has a 5,220mAh battery, a large step up from the 4,310mAh battery in the original console. That’s a sizable jump, and if its battery has the same voltage of the original Switch, that would equate to around 19Whr. That’s a smaller battery than theSteam Deck, which is probably why Nintendo quotes a similar battery life to the Steam Deck, despite its less power-hungry processor.
Nintendo probably could have put a more powerful battery in the Switch 2, but its decision likely came down to size constraints. There’s only so much battery that’ll fit while retaining the same thickness as the original Nintendo Switch, after all.
The most striking difference at first glancebetween the Switch and Switch 2is probably going to be the display. While it doesn’t have the OLED screen that made theSwitch OLEDsuch a marvel, the display is bigger and has a higher resolution. The Nintendo Switch 2 sports a 7.9-inch LCD display with a resolution of 1920x1080 with HDR 10 support. The display is also fast, supporting variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. That’s honestly a bit overkill considering the silicon powering the thing, but it does mean that older games or indie titles will feel extremely smooth – assuming they have unlocked frame rates. 120Hz is also a useful refresh rate for games that target 40fps since that makes for a clean ratio that won’t result in excessive stuttering.
Nintendo hasn’t released any information about the brightness of the display, but the HDR 10 certification means it needs toat leasthave a peak brightness of 1,000 nits, so it’s going to be a bright screen. We don’t know exactly how color performance will turn out either, but Nintendo does claim that it supports WCG, or Wide Color Gamut.
The display is probably going to be the thing that lifts the Nintendo Switch 2 above its competitors. The Steam Deck LCD has an 800p display with a peak brightness of 400 nits, and it doesn’t support WCG. The Steam Deck OLED does offer a much nicer display, but it’s still an 800p display. The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is also a huge upgrade over the original, which had a 6.2-inch, 720p LCD display.
In a vacuum, the Nintendo Switch 2 is massively better than the original Nintendo Switch. It’s leagues faster, has a screen that’s bigger, brighter and sharper, and has Joy-Con that you don’t have to wrestle with to disconnect. The only problem is that the Switch doesn’t exist in a vacuum anymore.
There are a ton of handheld gaming systems out there now, and while most of them are more expensive than the $449 Nintendo Switch 2, they likely offer a better gameplay experience in multi-platform games. The real appeal of the Switch 2 is going to be Nintendo’s catalog of first-party games, just like with the original console. Nintendo is known for making great games that make the most of its – relatively – weak hardware. If you’re the type of gamer that falls in love with Nintendo games, then the Nintendo Switch 2 makes a lot of sense. However, if you’re just going to get this thing to play Cyberpunk or Elden Ring on the train, there arebetter gaming handheld optionsout there.

"Amazon UK opened preorders to everyonelooking to preorder the Switch 2 today, dropping its previous invite-only system, but it is now out of stock. Argos is also back with a fresh round ofSwitch 2 preorders back in stock today, including not just the console, but games and accessories too.

If you missed out last time, now’s your chance to lock one in without the faff. But, note that the Switch 2Mario Kart World bundleis currently out of stock at Argos. For the latest updates on new drops, bundles, and restocks, be sure to follow@IGNUKDealson Twitter/X orBluesky.
Meanwhile, Nintendo's official UK preorders also began today, with retailers like EE, GAME, and Smyths experiencing rapid sell-outs. Unfortunately, this has already led to scalpers appearing on eBay with inflated prices. Currently, Amazon and Argos seem to be the most reliable options for securing a Switch 2 in the UK.
For future reference, as it's a common FAQ, Amazon won't charge you until your console ships, making it a low-risk way to guarantee your purchase. While some users initially saw aJune 7th delivery estimate when preordering last week, Amazon support has clarified this is an error, and the current plan remains for launch day delivery on June 5th. Argos, on the other hand, will charge you for your purchase immediately. Stay tuned for more updates.
Here's what Logan Plant had to say inIGN's Nintendo Switch 2 preview: ""Switch 2 is a more premium product and the price tag reflects that. It’s also a better version of a great thing, and it’s trying to pull off a bunch of cool new tricks at the same time, like mouse controls. Obviously we’re both buying Switch 2 on day one, and I did really love our hands-on time with the console. But I’ll be honest and say I have some concerns about if the general public is willing to adopt a $450 Nintendo console with an $80 Mario Kart.""
""It’s a big ask for a company that traditionally targets families and younger players, and I feel like the high cost of entry limits the Switch 2’s potential to take off in the way its predecessor did. But for those of you that do decide to take the plunge, you’ll be getting what’s shaping up to be a great hybrid console that makes a ton of worthwhile improvements on the original Switch and adds some fun bells and whistles for good measure.""

In a surprise move,Nintendo has delayed the start of Switch 2 preorders in the United States, just days before they were set to go live. The decision comes in response to ongoing tariff concerns and what the company described as ""evolving market conditions""—a direct reference to the revived threat of Trump-era import duties on electronics.
Preorders were originally scheduled to begin on April 9 in the US, but Nintendo has now put them on hold indefinitely. While no new date has been provided, the company has reassured fans that theSwitch 2’s global release date—June 5, 2025—remains unchanged.
The official statement Nintendo shared with IGN: ""Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”
For now, the preorder freeze applies exclusively to the US market. UK preorders remain on track, with no changes to pricing or availability. In fact, retailers like Amazon UK are actively sending out preorder invitations, all the while launch-day stock is already starting to dry up across major outlets.
Nintendo had announced that theSwitch 2 is priced at $449.99 USD, while theMario Kart World bundle—which includes the full game—is set at$499.99 USD.Mario Kart World will also be sold separately for$79.99 USD.
If you're not keen on paying upfront,Amazon still remains your best optionin the UK. When available to buy retailers like Argos require immediate payment, but Amazon won’t charge a penny until dispatch—making it a safer bet if you're budgeting ahead of June. How the invites work merely seems to be a ballot system where invitees are selected at random.
For preorders at theNintendo Store, where access is limited to long-timeNintendo Switch Online subscribers with high playtimes and shared usage data, Amazon’s invite system is far more accessible. It appears to operate on a simple ballot, meaning anyone has a fair shot—regardless of play history or membership status. Currys and Smyths are also expected to offer more preorder opportunities later through email alerts and queue systems, similar to their successful PS5 launch approach.
With Currys and Smyths, it looks like it will simply be a case of sending out an email when preorders are opened, followed by a queued ordering system. This was the method Currys used when taking PS5 preorders, and it worked without any site crashes at least. This means you could be in for a longer wait from these alternative retailers, but it's a lot less frustrating if you're certain you don't meet the strict requirements to order from Nintendo directly.

"It’s been a wild news roller coaster for U.S. gamers this week. It began with the celebratory full reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 in all its glory and games, followed closely by audience dismay over its $450 price tag and $80 for Mario Kart World, only for everyone to reel once again this morning as Nintendo announced it would hold off on pre-orders for the system until it could assess the impact of the Trump Administration’s sudden, sweeping, unprecedented tariffs on just about every nation in the world.

We’ve written elsewhere aboutwhy the Nintendo Switch 2 cost so much to begin with, and what impactthe industry’s trade association thinks these new tariffs are likely to have on games writ large. But right now, the real question on everyone’s minds is, what’s Nintendo going to do? When pre-orders do open, will the Nintendo Switch 2 be even more expensive?
Normally, when there are questions to the tune of “what is going to happen with video games?”, I go ask a panel of expert industry analysts. While they can’t literally predict the future, most of the time, they have a pretty solid consensus understanding, backed by evidence and data, of what’s most likely to happen, and I turn around and write about that. I’ve already done it twice this week.
But for the first time since I started interviewing analysts on such topics, every single analyst I spoke to was effectively stumped. Several had guesses one way or another: Nintendo will raise the price, or won’t. But every single one of them heavily caveated their response with an emphasis on the chaos of the moment. This has never happened before, it’s all happening very fast, and absolutely no one can accurately predict what Nintendo, Trump, or anyone will do tomorrow, next week, or months down the road.
So with that rather astonishing disclaimer in mind, here’s what all the analysts I spoke todidsay:
With everyone I spoke to taking their best wild guesses on what was going to happen, I ended up with a pretty divided panel. On the side of “Nintendo will raise prices” was Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games. Though he says he at first thought it was too late for Nintendo to raise prices after it had announced them, this delay has changed his mind. At this stage, he doesn’t think Nintendo has much of a choice.
“It is very difficult to predict, but Nintendo will likely take a few days to run simulations and then announce hikes, not only for the system itself but also games and accessories,” he said. “I hope I am wrong but if sustained, these sky-high tariffs leave them no choice. Would you be surprised now to see Switch 2 hit US$500 for the base model? I wouldn't.
“What I also want to add is this: Why on earth did Nintendo not wait for the US to fix their tariffs first and then decide on pricing during a Direct a few days later? This made no sense.”
Mat Piscatella, senior analyst at Circana, heavily caveated his opinion (as did basically everyone else) with a reminder that this is all unprecedented and unpredictable. But ultimately, he too came down on the side of games prices generally, including Nintendo prices, likely going up. But how much, and on what is anyone’s guess. “Based on the conversations I'm having, the breadth and depth of the tariffs surprised everyone, not just consumers,” he said.
Piscatella told me that Nintendo likely had some assumptions in mind about what the tariffs would be when it set the price originally. But when the actual tariffs came in on Wednesday, it was probably much higher than Nintendo, or anyone, anticipated.
“Every reasonable and responsible business that relies on international supply chains will be reevaluating its US consumer pricing at this point. They have to.
“Some territories and regions globally have historically been subject to higher pricing than other parts of the world when it comes to video games. The US could certainly be joining that group because of these tariffs. The haphazard and chaotic nature of the tariffs and their announcement obviously has many scrambling to navigate the fallout.”
Manu Rosier, director of market analysis at Newzoo, also predicts that hardware prices will increase, though he suggests software will likely not be impacted in the same way.
“While physical versions might be subject to tariffs, the growing dominance and lower cost of digital distribution would likely limit any broader effect,” he said.
“Regarding hardware, however, the situation is more sensitive. If a 20% tariff—or any substantial increase—were to be introduced, it’s unlikely that companies like Nintendo would absorb the additional cost by cutting into their margins. In such cases, the burden could shift to consumers in the form of higher retail prices.”
On the other side of speculation, again with a heavy dose of telling me how unprecedented this is and how no one really knows what will happen, I find Joost van Dreunen, NYU Stern professor and author ofSuperJoost Playlist. He acknowledges that a price increase on the Nintendo Switch 2 is possible, especially given the high tariffs on Vietnam. But he thinks the company will try very, very hard to avoid that.
""I believe the volatility from the Trump tariffs was already considered in the Switch 2's $449.99 pricing,” he said. “Given the first Trump administration's impact, Nintendo, like other manufacturers, has since restructured its supply chain to mitigate such geopolitical risks. Historically, Nintendo has aimed for a launch price around the $400 mark, adjusted for inflation, suggesting that the current price already reflects an anticipation of potential economic challenges stemming from ongoing trade disputes.
“Nevertheless, the unpredictable nature of these tariff decisions—exemplified by the recent situation in Vietnam—injects a significant amount of uncertainty into the market. This could compel Nintendo to find ways to absorb or offset additional costs, especially when initial product margins are typically narrower. While I expect Nintendo will strive to maintain the $449.99 price point, the external economic pressures may eventually force a reassessment if the trade landscape deteriorates further.""
Piers Harding-Rolls, games researcher at Ampere Analysis, agrees, saying that Nintendo runs the risk of consumer backlash if it raises prices further:
“The extent of the tariffs and its impact on Vietnamese exports are really bad news for Nintendo,” he says. “The company is now in between a rock and a hard place, having already announced the launch price. I have already suggested that the pricing would stay as announced until 2026 at the earliest but then might be adjusted if the tariffs stay in place. This delay in pre-orders is to give the company more time and it will be hoping some sort of solution will be found over the next few weeks. This is a pretty fluid situation after all. Nintendo will not want to change the price having announced it, but I think everything is on the table now. If the pricing does change, it will impact the brand and the US consumer’s view of the product at launch. I don’t think that will put off loyal fans, but it might put off broader consumers who will take a wait a see approach. That’s particularly important during its first holiday season.”
Finally, I spoke to Rhys Elliott, games analyst at Alinea Analytics. Elliott joined the first camp of analysts in predicting higher prices on both Nintendo hardware and software due to Trump’s tariffs. He also pointed back to hiscomments in my previous analyst piece, where he spoke on Nintendo announcing cheaper digital editions of Nintendo Switch 2 games in certain markets. “It seems the lower prices in other markets were to nudge Switch 2 buyers to digital, as I mentioned my comments to IGN about Mario Kart World’s pricing. Nintendo might have wanted to do something similar in the US, but the tariff situation is so chaotic that Nintendo was in ‘wait and see’ mode — and decided to hedge its bets to see if it needed to offset the tariffs.”
Elliott went on to project a rather grim picture of what will happen to the games industry more broadly as a result of the tariffs, with his predictions in line with whata spokesperson from the Entertainment Software Association warned me of earlier this morningon the same topic. He says that the tariffs will result in a “weaker, poorer nation”, with consumers ultimately paying the price. Here’s the rest of Elliott’s take on this:
“Some manufacturers – Nintendo included – have been shifting their manufacturing to non-tariff-impacted markets,” Elliott says. “And even if companies can afford to switch up (no pun intended!) their supply chains, who knows which markets will get tariffs next – as recent news supports. Companies cannot just lift up their whole supply chain and move everything to the US. It’s just not logistically possible. Under current law (I can’t believe I have to qualify this, but here we are), Trump would not be in power anymore by the time such a move would be completed – for Nintendo and other manufacturers. We are living in … there’s no other word for it .. unhinged times driven by an unhinged man (and other forces).
“These extreme tariffs will also be bad for consumers in the US but are positive for the US administration’s populist façade. Policies that lead to higher prices for everyday people amid a cost-of-living crisis are deplorable. They're bad for gamers and the games business. I won’t comment on the real reason for the US tariffs, but ‘a much stronger, much richer nation’ is not it.
What’s more, time and time again, data has shown that tariffs harm the economy. Comparative advantage is a core principle of international trade theory. Basically, consumption and economic well-being are stronger when countries focus on producing goods they can efficiently produce (at the lowest cost compared to other goods) –  and trade for goods they are less efficient at producing. The trade war flies in the face of these core economic principles.”

This Iniu power bank holds a 10,000mAh, or 37Whr battery capacity. If you factor in 80% power efficiency, here are the approximate number of times you can fully recharge each gaming handheld:
The Iniu power bank has three output ports: one built-in 45W USB Type-C cable, one 45W USB Type-C port, and one USB Type-A port. The 45W of Power Delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch (18W) and Steam Deck (40W) at their fastest rate. This power bank is also a solid choice for charging your Apple iPhone 16, sinceChargerLAB has shown that the maximum charging rate caps at about 30W, even for the Pro Max model.
We don't yet know what the maximum charging rate for theNintendo Switch 2will be, but we are hoping that it will be greater than the 18W maximum of the original Switch.We do know that the battery capacity is higher(5,220mAh vs 4,310mAh), so it's only natural to assume that the charging rate will also be higher to maintain the same recharging time. The Nintendo Switch 2's 5,200mAh capacity should translate to about 20Whr, which means this power bank will be able to charge it about 1.5 times.
The built-in cable is a popular feature on newer and generally pricier power banks because you no longer have to bring along your own USB Type-C cable. When you're on the go, the USB plug can be clipped onto the power bank to form a handy little lanyard. The cable itself is quite sturdy with a respectable break strength of 44 pounds and the lanyard loop when clipped to the power bank itself has a break strength of 13 pounds.

"A sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie is more than a year away, but there's already a name being floated for Wario: The Last of Us Season 1 star and Ron Swanson himself, Nick Offerman.

Speaking to IGN on the red carpet ahead of The Last of Us Season 2 premeire, showrunner Craig Mazin floated Offerman's name as a potential Mario antagonist.
HBO's The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin thinks Wario is misunderstood – and that Nick Offerman should voice Wario in the next Mario moviepic.twitter.com/Idui04BOtB
""Nick Offerman would actually do a really good job I think,"" Mazin said. ""Just to bring some gravitas. Because I love Wario and I think he's misunderstood.""
Mazin previously said that Wario was his favorite character in Mario Kart. ""I want people to understand Wario is the way he is for reasons,"" Mazin continued. ""He's Wario! He's-a gonna win!""
Offerman is perhaps best known for his seven-season run as Ron Swanson on the NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation. He won an Emmy for his guest role playing Bill in the first season of The Last of Us.
A sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie is set to be released next year. In October, Toad voice actor Keegan-Michael Key teased that the follow-up filmwill feature some Nintendo characters that are “really deep cuts.”
The record-breaking The Super Mario Bros. Movie features a long list of Nintendo characters, but still some were left on the table. In an interview withMen's Journal, Key said the sequel will include characters that weren’t in the first film, some of which should please the most hardcore of Nintendo fans.
“I feel like what they've done creatively is they've really widened out the universe that these characters live in and we're going to meet some new folks,” Key said.
“We're going to meet some new folks that are old favorites and some folks that I think are really deep cuts, but because of the way the story's laying itself out right now, those characters are going to be very intriguing.”
But who? Nintendo fans have speculated about all sorts of characters who’d fit the ""deep cut"" bill, ranging from more well-known picks such as Bowser Jr and Rosalina to Tatanga and Toadette. For now, we don’t know who exactly to expect, but Key did say the second movie is “a little broader in scope, and where it takes place is very intriguing lore and the Mario world.”
Nintendo and Illumination announced the next Super Mario Bros. Movielast year with a release date of April 3, 2026. While not much was revealed, it was confirmed that The Super Mario Bros. Movie directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic will return.
Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto said at the time: ""We'll let you know the details once we're ready to share more. This time too, the staff at Illumination and Nintendo are working together. We're thinking about broadening Mario's world further, and it'll have a bright and fun story. We hope you'll look forward to it!""
Before the sequel was confirmed, Bowser voice actor Jack Black, who's set to star in A Minecraft Movie as Steve, said he’d like to show off more of his vocal chops in any follow up,as he had pitched the idea of a musical titled Bowser's Revenge. ""I think it should be a full musical, like what Todd Phillips is supposedly doing with Joker 2,"" he said.
Bowser's romantic ode to Princess Peach in The Super Mario Bros. Movie became an instant hit,landing a place on the Billboard Hot 100, but Black was initially hesitant about singing in the film. He toldIGNthat he tries ""not to do too many crossovers"" where his characters sing, but he couldn't pass up a love song.
The Last of Us Season 2, meanwhile, debuts April 13, 2025.

"The Legend of Zelda live-action movieis in active development at Nintendo and Sony Pictures fora March 2027 release. It’s early days yet for the hotly anticipated feature film adaptation of the blockbuster video game franchise – which, after years of rumors, wasofficially announced in November 2023– so here’s what we know for sure about the movie so far.

The film is being produced by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Avi Arad, chairman of Arad Productions and former founder and CEO of Marvel Studios. Sony Pictures Entertainment will handle theatrical distribution in addition to co-financing the movie with Nintendo. Jurassic World’s Derek Connolly is writing the screenplay.
Wes Ball, who made the Maze Runner movies and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, is directing Zelda. As if he was fated to land the job,Ball actually tweeted about wanting to make a Zelda movie way back in 2010.
At that time, Ball said he envisioned his Zelda as being another mo-cap endeavor like James Cameron’s Avatar. More recently, the filmmaker said he wants his Legend of Zelda to be “this awesome fantasy-adventure movie that isn’t like Lord of the Rings, it’s its own thing. I've always said, I would love to see a live-action Miyazaki. That wonder and whimsy that he brings to things, I would love to see something like that.""
In a later interview, Ball backed off of his 2010 notion of making it a mo-cap movie. In May 2024, Ball said makingan all mo-cap Zelda movie “probably isn't his choice”since he was just coming off of the CG-heavy KIngdom of the Planet of the Apes. Ball’s aim is to make Legend of Zelda feel ""grounded"" and ""real."" He added, “We're working hard, and we're gonna make something great.""
Ball has also said: ""I want to fulfil people's greatest desires. I know it's important, this [Zelda] franchise, to people, and I want it to be a serious movie. A real movie that can give people an escape. … [The film has] ""to feel like something real. Something serious and cool but fun and whimsical.""
A die hard Zelda fan who said he grew up on the franchise, Ball unintentionally stirred up other fans whenhe refused to tell IGN last year what his favorite Zelda game was.
No one has been cast yet but The Sixth Sense’sHaley Joel Osment expressed his desire to land a role in the Zelda moviewhen he appeared onIGN Arcade. Euphoria’sHunter Schafer has expressed interest in playing Princess Zelda.
Euphoria star Hunter Schafer is a fan of the Nintendo series, saying, “I love the game, personally. I played it as a kid and I still play it now. Who knows! That would be pretty cool.”pic.twitter.com/lDNB1BkEqJ
Fan reaction when the movie was officially announcedback in November 2023 was swift and opinionated. Some took umbrage at Avi Arad – the former boss of Marvel Studios who also produced Ghost in the Shell and the early Spider-Man movies – being involved (“Can't believe they were able to get the producer of the hit film Morbius!!”). Others weren’t thrilled by the selection of Wes Ball to direct.
The decision to make the Legend of Zelda a live-action movie was met with trepidation: “People can say Zelda plot doesn't work in live action but action films have hardly ever relied on deep, complex plots to engage people.” “Animated would have been the way to go if you ask me.”
IGN editors also expressed their thoughts aboutwhy Zelda should be an animated movie instead of live-action. “And while hand-drawn art may be the best fit for a Zelda movie in my opinion, there are plenty of animation styles that would serve as a better vehicle for Zelda than live-action,” IGN’s Logan Plant wrote at the time the movie was announced.
“Think about all the gorgeous animated projects we’ve seen in the last several years: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Dragon Quest: Your Story, the Castlevania anime, or even a claymation look come to mind as visual styles that would perfectly suit the wonderful world of Hyrule. I can visualize what all these versions of Hyrule would look like, but I can’t say the same thing about live-action.”
“There are so many oddities in Zelda that come across as charming when animated, but could easily be seen as off-putting when done in live-action. This is a franchise where a literal enormous pig is the main villain, after all. But Zelda is also full of surprising horrors, from zombies that wrap their entire bodies around Link to try and kill him, to disembodied giant hands that swoop down from the ceiling. I have a hard time seeing a lot of Zelda enemies make it into a live-action movie without seriously frightening the little ones.”
IGN’s Matt Kim also opined at the time thatit would be “a trap” if Nintendo and Ball tried to adapt Breath of the Wildfor the silver screen: “If you’re going to make a Zelda movie, I’d adapt one of the games where the story is a bit more center-stage, whether it’s the pirate adventures of Wind Waker, the classic sword and sorcery of A Link to the Past, or arguably the most cinematic Zelda game of all-time, Twilight Princess.”
“Game devs have marveled at the power of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom’s engineering, calling the way its systems interact with each other near-magic. It’s not just showing audiences Link’s cool abilities but playing within an entire world, with its own laws of nature that just simply cannot be conveyed by looking at a screen alone. While there are plenty of fun moments a Breath of the Wild movie could include as fun easter eggs — like Link discovering he gets a stat bonus when he cooks during the blood moon for example — the game’s sense of discovery can never truly be captured on camera. … Breath of the Wild turns players into theoretical physicists, experimenting with how the interlocking rules of the game play off one another – which, unless the director plans on making a movie similar to Oppenheimer, would make for not a lousy Zelda movie.”
For their part, the filmmakers acknowledge the risk inherent in making a live-action Zelda movie. ""Regarding the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda,I know we face an extremely high hurdlein producing a film that will not disappoint the global fan base,"" Shigeru Miyamoto told Nintendo investors during a Q&A in November 2023. Miyamoto added that he had been developing the Zelda movie with Arad for ten years prior to the official announcement.
Sony Pictures will release The Legend of Zelda in theaters on March 26, 2027. In order to make that date, fans should expect filming to commence in 2026 or maybe even late this year to allow for enough post-production time to pull of the film’s visual effects.
There isn’t one as nothing has been filmed yet. However, IGN pranked the Internet on April Fool’s Day 2008 when we releaseda faux live-action Zelda movie trailer(which can be viewed below). Until there’s a real movie trailer to watch, ours will have to do:
Who do you think should play Link, Zelda and other key characters in the upcoming movie? Let us know in the comments."
"Rejoice, fellow Nintendo fans. On Wednesday, the clouds parted, the sun rose, and the divine spectra; hand of Miyamoto reached down from the sky to grace us with Nintendo’s newest handheld carnival of joy, the Switch 2. After years of speculation, we finally have a clear look at the mysterious console hybrid.

Sadly, while sleek, compact, and powerful, the rumours are untrue. The Switch 2 does not in fact pack a tiny little Reggie into every GPU. But after we spent an hour during the Direct glued to every word: dissecting it, screenshotting every image, poring over captured video for tiny clues to its form and function, we can finally apply something besides guesswork and give you some solid facts, including all the ways it leaves its beloved predecessor in the dust.
This is probably the least-surprising revelation as practically every next-gen Nintendo console has been significantly improved over its predecessor (yes, even the Wii). Still, when released in 2017, Switch was hardly a cutting-edge powerhouse in comparison to Sony and Xbox consoles, and eight years later it noticeably struggles under demanding games. Nintendo and its partners were increasingly running up against the limitations of the hardware.
This week we saw elements on display promising us a vastly improved experience: handheld resolutions up to 1080p, docked up to 4K, both with HDR, and framerates extending up to 120 fps. It’s a welcome upgrade that should allow a wider variety of games to come to Switch 2. We may already see some of the fruit in EA’s decision to host soccer and football games on Switch 2, and 2K’s intention to do the same with wrestling and basketball.
Third parties revealed all manner of current-gen games to give us some idea of the Switch 2’s increased capabilities, and what we saw was encouraging: a console/handheld capable of handling Elden Ring, Street Fighter 6, and other demanding software. And what Nintendo showed of their new first-party offerings was simply gorgeous.
The little purple lunchbox that could finally comes to Nintendo Switch Online, exclusively available on Switch 2. Nintendo has effectively drawn a fence between online experiences on Switch and Switch 2, and that means that from this point forward those who want to play some of Nintendo’s best retro games are going to have to shell out for better hardware. Sure, it’s only three games right now, but those three games are absolute bangers: The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and, holy crap, Soul Calibur 2, complete with Link.
Okay, seriously. Soul Calibur 2 is incredible. If you’ve never played it with a friend you are in for such a treat.
When humanity later reviews and catalogues the glorious day in video game history, the opening chapter won’t be about how Mario Kart is now like Forza Horizon, or about Donkey Kong’s return in Bananza, or even about the announcement of the until-now secret project called Duskblood. Instead, the book will open and perhaps also close with the most significantly un-Nintendo thing to happen this week: easy integration of online features commonly available on other platforms.
The company that brought us Friend Codes now graces us with GameChat, a feature-rich communication and visual sharing feature set for Switch 2. A noise-cancelling mic picks up your voice and shares it with friends. An optional desktop camera allows you to share your face, both in window-corners and in compatible games like Mario Party. You can also share screens across consoles remotely. It’s much of what we gave up on asking Nintendo for years ago... a simple, straightforward tool for playing with friends. I’m looking forward to seeing how it actually plays out.
So much potential awaits with this feature. Where my mind keeps going is Monster Hunter, with teams of four benefitting from shared screens as they pursue and trap their prey. It’s simply become unthinkable for Nintendo to voluntarily offer fans such a useful array of online features, but here we are living in the future at last.
Okay, we’d already guessed this but it’s still really cool. Joy-Cons now magnetically snap to the Switch 2 body rather than slotting in. Nintendo showed off how the steel shoulder buttons on each controller attract to the magnetic facing along the sides of the screen, locking them together. A press of a button releases the magnetic grip.
This is a pretty great feature for my home setup, where a shelf top obstructs removing the Joy-Cons without removing the entire Switch from the dock, which sometimes leads to knocking the whole thing down. I’m a fan.
Bigger isn’t always better with handhelds, but given the sharper resolution of the 1080p portable screen and the nature of most Switch games, the slight increase in size to 7.9 inches should be a net gain for most players. The first Switch sacrificed screen real estate for portability but I think Nintendo is making the right call in giving these elaborate, feature -rich games more space to shine.
Nintendo was weirdly excited to show off its innovative Joy-Con mouse features. A Switch 2 Joy-Con laid on its side can be scooted across a tabletop, and its telemetry tracked to provide precise pointing and rotation. It looks to be heavily-supported at launch by games like Drag x Drive, Civ 7, and Metroid Prime 4.
I do love wacky Nintendo. My guess is the mouse feature won’t see much use past launch window (much like the microphone on the old DS) but I’m actually 1000% in on playing Metroid Prime 4 with a mouse. As a PC gamer, I rarely enjoy FPS games that force me to use a controller, so this surprising option feels a bit liberating. Hopefully we get Mario Paint 2.
This one is more of a double-edged sword. Nintendo crammed the Switch 2 with 256GB of external storage, much more than the original Switch. But with all the Switch 2’s extra graphics capacity, those asset-rich game files are going to be much bigger too, so it may be close to a wash. The memory is quicker as well to deal with larger game files, which means you’ll need a new, faster memory card for your supplemental storage.
Nintendo tweaked the Switch hardware in response to nearly a decade of feedback. Switch 2 now features two USB-C ports, with one added on top to assist in charging while playing in kickstand mode. Nintendo added a fan to the doc to aid in cooling consistency. Sticks are larger and sound capabilities are improved.
Even the Switch 2 Pro Controller is a step up, with an audio jack (at last!) and assignable buttons. No telling yet if the new controller contains the same miniaturized star that exists at the core of every Switch Pro Controller, giving it near-unlimited battery life.
And one of the most subtle features might be most useful. I do a fair bit of Switch playing on my tabletop. The fact that the Switch 2 screen angle is adjustable in kickstand mode is a huge deal for me. Too often, ambient light at an airport or the angle of a tight airplane tray table make playing in kickstand seem like an exercise in futility. But with the ability to subtly shift angles, coupled with the new mouse feature, leads me to believe I might actually be able to enjoy a serious game of Civilization 7 on the go.
So first off, Switch 2 is backward compatible. That’s always good. Microsoft has already blazed a pretty amazing trail toward optimized backward compatibility on Xbox, and Nintendo has also wisely taken a note from its own Gamecube to Wii to WiiU history, making most Switch games a snap to play on new hardware. Backward capacity helps sell consoles their first year.
While the Nintendo Switch 2 is backward compatible with Switch games, it also supports special new Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of certain Switch titles like Metroid Prime 4. These enhanced titles offer new features including a selection between a higher-res Quality Mode or a faster frame rate in Performance Mode.
One really cool feature of these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions is that if you already own the original game on Switch, you will be able to purchase a simple Switch 2 Edition upgrade and enjoy all the new features on your new hardware.  Let's hope it's not too expensive.
It’s also possible that Switch 2 Editions of Switch’s notoriously-janky Pokemon games could be improved by these features. Let's hope so. Throwing hardware at things can’t solve every problem but sometimes it really helps.
Mario Kart World does everything we expect of Mario Kart and adds two key elements. The first is the ability to traverse a continuous world Forza Horizon-style, racing from course to course, free mode exploring, fooling around, and so on. The second is the swelling of the field size to 24 carts, which is, well, a lot to get one’s head around when the shells start flying. It sounds like absolute bedlam. I can’t wait.
Nintendo took its time showing off new games but toward the end of the show we bought about a minute tease of a new Kirby’s Air Ride game, Kirby’s Air Riders, an announcement that would likely have resulted in a thunderous snooze were it not for the surprising involvement of one Mr. Sakurai, known equally for his self-immolating work ethic and his status as god of Smash Bros. I love Kirby, but Air Ride sucked... BUT it’s Sakurai so I’m now 100% in.
Then there was The Duskbloods, a trailer that produced some hysterics in me. At first I thought it was Bloodborne 2, then I thought it was a licensed FROM Software take on Castlevania, and then finally I accepted that what I was seeing was an entirely original Miyazaki game exclusive to Switch. My friends, remember: FROM Software does not miss. Probably you will die. Probably you will dodge roll. Certainly you will have a blast.
And of course; the real King of Kong makes his triumphant return to 3D with Donkey Kong Bananza. It’s a moment of absolution for Nintendo: 26 years after dropping the barbequed turd Donkey Kong 64 on an unsuspecting planet, a wiser, more skilled Nintendo has returned to the drawing board with what’s sure to be a landmark adventure.
Nintendo devs have been absolutely murdering 3D platforming on the Switch, not just with Odyssey and Bowser’s Fury, but also with Kirby’s incredible journey to the shores of the Forgotten Lands. Bananza was constructed to showcase far more capable hardware than these modern-day classics, which means that the devs had opportunities to iterate on ideas that wouldn’t have been possible on a basic Switch.

"For the last several years it’s felt like Nintendo just hasn’t cared that much about Donkey Kong. As Nintendo gifted pretty much every one of its cherished characters their best outingeveron Switch, the great ape who once stood high atop the girders of Nintendo’s essential arcade cabinet faceplanted hard on the concrete with a litany of ports, remakes, and remasters. But on Switch 2, Nintendo is finally giving one of gaming’s biggest icons the love he deserves with abrand new, flagship, launch window 3D action-platformer, and if the first 30 minutes we spent with Donkey Kong Bananza are any indication, Mario’s original rival is looking poised to stand tall once again.

It’s hard to talk about Bananza without referencing that darn plumber as just seconds after jumping into its Underground World, the significant parallels to Super Mario Odyssey became abundantly clear. While Nintendo hasn’t confirmed the developers of Bananza, after playing it we’re willing to bet Odyssey developer Nintendo EPD Tokyo is behind it.
Bananza’s setup will feel instantly familiar to anyone who’s spent hours throwing Cappy and collecting Power Moons. DK is joined by an adorable assistant (this time in the form of a purple rock who talks and sings) to scour self-contained explorable sandboxes for Golden Bananas, some of which are found by completing story missions while others are sprinkled across the landscape just waiting to be found. As you explore, you find isolated linear challenge rooms that dial back the exploration in favor of testing your combat and platforming abilities. There are other collectibles to find too, like gold presumably playing the role of coins, dozens of fossils (which we didn’t find a use for during our demo) and currency  we’re hoping will be used to outfit Donkey Kong in the local flavor. Even the UI is reminiscent of Mario’s globetrotting adventure! So if you were disappointed  the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct lacked a big, flashy 3D Mario, I'm here to tell you that Donkey Kong Bananza feels like the sequel to that formula we’ve been clamoring for, it just happens to star the giant monkey instead.
Like the best Nintendo games, Donkey Kong’s brand new moveset completely suits him as a character and feels right the moment you step into his shoes (okay, big hairy feet). Bananza is furiously fast and delightfully destructive as Donkey Kong can demolish most of the terrain in his path, and we spent our demo transforming the lush opening area filled with grass, trees, and lakes into DK’s personal chaotic excavation site. DK punches forward, upward, and downward, instantly destroying most materials and oftentimes carving a makeshift path to follow that can lead to entirely new areas. At one point I was punching through a mountain just for the heck of it and a valuable collectible fell into my lap, so there’s definitely value to breaking ground everywhere you can – it may lead to a groundbreaking discovery.
If pulverizing every stone wall in sight sounds overwhelming, it really didn’t feel that way in the moment, which is likely due to how much fun we had controlling Donkey Kong. In addition to turning everything to rubble, Donkey Kong can also pick up giant stone boulders from the ground, walls, or wherever, and hurl them to obliterate nearby enemies. Or, he takes a page out of Link’s book and can use the stone slab to boogie board at a rapid pace across the landscape. There are surely dozens of unique moves and chain combos waiting to be discovered and I can imagine how much fun speedrunners will have trying to master DK’s moveset, which already feels ripe with expressiveness and possibility.
Bananza’s central theme of exploration via destruction was present throughout every second of our demo, even down to the map screen. Instead of a simple top-down overview of the landscape, the map here is a fully-rendered 3D model of the entire areain its current state,meaning when you pause to get your bearings, you can see all of the walls you’ve punched and caves you’ve carved. It’s like the Hero’s Path feature in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom cranked up to 11, and it felt like an incredibly impressive touch.
That map helped us track down challenge rooms which rewarded us either with Golden Bananas or a ton of cash. And unlike Odyssey, there’s no more wondering if you have a Moon left to find and going inside to wait for Cappy to tell you, because the entrance to each bonus room tracks how many Golden Bananas you’ve found and how many more are waiting within. We saw three of these rooms in Bananza’s opening area, with each focusing on either platforming, combat, or destruction: we had to monkey bar our way through an obstacle course, take down three stone enemies before time ran out, and blast through as much gold ore as possible to take home a big payday. They were all fun and unique and left me excited to see what other challenges are in store.
I also think Bananza is on track to be one of the most gorgeous Nintendo games I’ve seen. It really does take advantage of Switch 2's hardware – the environments are beautiful and DK’s animations are wonderfully expressive, and I left feeling like the next generation of first-party Nintendo games had truly arrived.
Donkey Kong Bananza is out July 17 for $69.99, and I might destroy my entire house if I have to wait that long to play it again.
Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager & Playlist Editor. He played the entire Donkey Kong Country series earlier this year and is so excited for a brand new DK game. It's way overdue!"

This Iniu power bank holds a 10,000mAh, or 37Whr battery capacity. If you factor in 80% power efficiency, here are the approximate number of times you can fully recharge each gaming handheld:
The Iniu power bank has three output ports: one built-in 45W USB Type-C cable, one 45W USB Type-C port, and one USB Type-A port. The 45W of Power Delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch (18W) and Steam Deck (40W) at their fastest rate. This power bank is also a solid choice for charging your Apple iPhone 16, sinceChargerLAB has shown that the maximum charging rate caps at about 30W, even for the Pro Max model.
We don't yet know what the maximum charging rate for theNintendo Switch 2will be, but we are hoping that it will be greater than the 18W maximum of the original Switch.We do know that the battery capacity is higher(5,220mAh vs 4,310mAh), so it's only natural to assume that the charging rate will also be higher to maintain the same recharging time. The Nintendo Switch 2's 5,200mAh capacity should translate to about 20Whr, which means this power bank will be able to charge it about 1.5 times.
The built-in cable is a popular feature on newer and generally pricier power banks because you no longer have to bring along your own USB Type-C cable. When you're on the go, the USB plug can be clipped onto the power bank to form a handy little lanyard. The cable itself is quite sturdy with a respectable break strength of 44 pounds and the lanyard loop when clipped to the power bank itself has a break strength of 13 pounds.

"It’s been a wild 48-hour news cycle if you follow economics at all, and wilder still if you’re a Nintendo fan.

On Wednesday, we learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 would cost $450 in the United States, a painfully high price thatanalysts saywas partly due to expectation of tariffs, and partly due to other factors like inflation, competition, and component costs.
Then, last night, the Trump Administrationannounced wide-reaching 10% tariffson essentially every country, with much higher tariffs on numerous nations such as China, the EU, Japan, Vietnam, Canada, Mexico, and many, many others. In response, Chinaannounced this morninga 34% reciprocal tariff on all U.S. goods. And just hours ago, in the wake of all this, Nintendo announced it would bepostponing Nintendo Switch 2 pre-ordersin the U.S. while it evaluated the impact of tariffs on its console plans.
It’s an unprecedented situation for everyone, both within and outside of gaming, and one that analysts, experts, and the general public are still trying to make sense of. Which is why just a short 30 minutes before Nintendo dropped its shocking pre-order news, I was on the phone with Aubrey Quinn, a spokesperson for the Entertainment Software Association, to discuss the impact these tariffs would have on the industry writ large.
The ESA, like everyone else, is still trying to figure out how all this is going to play out. Broadly, she says, they have some expectations. They knew tariffs of some sort were coming – both due to Trump’s past actions in his first administration and his repeated discussion of them on the campaign trail. And, once implemented, Quinn says they expected there would be risk of retaliation from other countries like China, as well as even more future tariffs and levies from the U.S. But the jury is still out on how this will ultimately play out.
What the ESA does feel confident saying, though, is that these tariffs will have a negative impact on video games:
“We really are, at this point, just watching and trying not to have knee-jerk reactions, because we don't think that what President Trump announced this week is the end of the story, but what was announced this week and the tariffs as outlined, we do expect these tariffs will have a real and detrimental impact on the industry and the hundreds of millions of Americans who love to play games,” Quinn says. “And so our goal is to work with the administration, to work with other elected officials to try to find a solution that doesn't damage U.S. industries, U.S. business, but also American gamers and families.”
When Quinn says there will be a detrimental impact, she doesn’t just mean the cost of systems, though she says it’s “hard to imagine a world where tariffs like these don’t impact pricing.” She says consumer spending will also be impacted, which will in turn impact company revenue. If companies see their profits drop, that will in turn impact jobs, as well as investment in research and development, and even what the next generation of consoles looks like. “The entire consumer ecosystem is connected,” she says.
So what’s the ESA doing about it? Well, a few things so far, but Quinn acknowledges it’s been difficult to get started. Even though the tariffs didn’t come as a surprise to anyone, she says the Trump Administration hasn’t been back in office for long – really just two months. Trump’s cabinet and administration is almost entirely made up of new people, too, so the ESA hasn’t been able to leverage relationships from his last term in office. And some of them were only appointed weeks ago.
“But yes, the short answer is we know who the conversations need to be happening with, and we are working on making connections and making sure that they understand that we are eager to work with them to find solutions that this is about public, private sector conversations happening, so we can understand and make sure that they see the impact and the risk of impact to business, to consumers, and really everything that's happening within the US borders,” she concludes.
Quinn points to the recent news that the ESA had already joined a coalition of trade associations to reach out to U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer and express their concerns prior to the tariff news earlier this week. And they’re asking for meetings with a number of legislations and members of the administration to discuss similar topics.
Is it working, I ask? Are they being heard?
“Yes. I can tell you conversations are happening with... I don't want to say every level,” she responds. “I've not met with Trump, right? So I don't want to say every level of government, but certainly we've met with members of the administration. We've met with employees at the White House, we've met with employees at USTR [the office of the United States Trade Representative], so yes, we are having conversations and we're also doing that in partnership with other associations to make sure that... This isn't a video game issue. I represent the video game industry, so I'm very aware of the impact on the video game industry, the potential impact, but it's not a video game industry. This is going to affect all consumer products from food to fashion to electronics.”
So what can consumers do about it if they’re concerned? Reach out to their representatives, Quinn responds. Write letters, call, send emails, tweets, whatever it looks like to let their elected leaders know they’re concerned. “I think the more members of government, elected officials, and their staff who hear that their constituents are concerned, the more likely we are to be heard and to potentially make an impact.”
Nintendo announced its hold on Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders due to the tariffs just minutes after our conversation had concluded. When I reached out to Quinn for further comment on that, she said the ESA doesn’t comment on what individual companies will do. But I did mention the Nintendo Switch 2’s already-high pricing at the end of our conversation, and Quinn had this to say:
“You know what? It's been interesting with media coverage around video games and tariffs because just unfortunate coincidental timing that the Switch [2 reveal] was the same day as President Trump's announcement. There are so many devices we play video games on. There are other consoles, but as I was saying, VR headsets, our smartphones, people who love PC games, if we think it's just the Switch, then we aren't taking it seriously. This is going to have an impact.
“And even American-based companies, they're getting products that need to cross into American borders to make those consoles, to make those games. And so there's going to be a real impact regardless of company. This is company-agnostic, this is an entire industry. There's going to be an impact on the entire industry.”

"If your wallet has been pleading for mercy, it might just have to hold on a little longer because today’s gaming deals are too good to ignore. Whether you're into high-speed hijinks, fantasy epics, or quirky co-op chaos, there's something to tempt every kind of gamer. With discounts this tempting, now’s the time to grab a controller, a mouse, or a magic paintbrush and dive into something new!

In retro news, I'm using a NOS burst to light 26 candles on a cake forNeed For Speed: High Stakes. This beloved racing game wasn't just about sating one's velocity requirements while unlocking new whips; lose a High Stakes race, and you'd perma-lose your car. Us launch adopters loved that risk-versus-reward structure and the groundbreaking damage system that would go on to influence the future of racing simulations.
Better yet, we had I highly localised Aussie version with Holden VT Clubsport and Ford AU Falcon XR8 featured prominently on the cover. Even cooler, winning the special HSV Pro Cup would unlock Craig Lowndes' MHRT VT Commo'. Using it to evade the fuzz down Durham Road (preferably in split-screen PvP) was mighty boss stuff.

"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is one of my overall favorite games. I first started playing it back in 2020 like everyone else and have been started up a new island several times since then. The series is just so cozy and stress-free, and LEGO has done a great job of capturing that aesthetic. LEGO has released quite a few Animal Crossing sets as it continues to build up theLEGO Nintendo brand, but the one that I personally like the most has just dropped to its lowest ever price.

The LEGO K.K.'s Concert in the Plaza set has dropped down to only $41.20 as part of theAmazon Spring Deal Days Sale. That's a 48% discount that drops the price lower than we've ever seen it before.
This LEGO Animal Crossing set wasfirst released back in August 2024alongside the Fly with Dodo Airlines set and various new LEGO Mario options. Tthe price has only recently started to drop, and with this discount it'slower than it has ever been beforeon Amazon. It's unlikely we will see a lower price than this, even for Prime Day or Black Friday, so right now is a great time to buy if you've already been considering it.
The set itself is only 550 pieces, so it can be easily put together in an afternoon. The centerpiece of the set is the classic Plaza and Resident services where Tom Nook is usually located, but it also comes with K.K's driveable camper van, a café, and a little tree permanently stuck in fall. You also get a little minifigure K.K. Slider (guitar included), Isabelle, and Audie. AlthoughK.K. Slider songsare not included, you could always have them play in the background while you put it together.
LEGO has been fairly consistent in releasing new Nintendo sets each year. Last year there were several months where new LEGO Animal Crossing sets came out, and most recently we hadthree new sets arrive in January 2025. That being said, there are currently no new Animal Crossing sets that have been announced for this year. More may arrive in the second half of the year, but right now, there are still only 10 sets featured on theLEGO Animal Crossing page."
"Mario Kart Worldis the first new home console Mario Kart game in a decade. We went hands-on with this Nintendo Switch 2 launch title and played a ton of it across several different modes, so let’s break it all down!

Mario Kart’s biggest new addition centers around a huge, new Forza Horizon-style world filled with tons of courses to race against friends and enemies on. Instead of just having a series of tracks you select from a menu (although you’ll have that option too) Mario Kart World features a massive playground you can explore at your own pace on your own or with friends. You use this place to cruise around for fun or launch into races, Grand Prix tournaments, and more. It’s also packed with collectibles and hidden secrets and areas, and while we don’t know just yet what the rewards will be for finding things hidden throughout this world, we’re hoping it’s stuff like karts or costumes, or that you’ll be able to spend coins in some kind of shop for cool cosmetic stuff. Poking around here between races led me to what looked like a strange Peach-themed coin, stacks of smaller, regular coins, a huge evil cloud, a ton of grind rails to practice on, hidden back alleys and pathways, and so much more. It’s grand, utterly gorgeous, and incredibly smooth. We got used to how great Mario Kart 8 looked, but this one is even prettier and more stylish, with better draw distance, more detailed characters and environments, and generally just a ton of stuff happening at once.

Mechanically, everything felt really tight and satisfying so even if there isn’t a ton of reward for exploring it’s still really fun to explore. But knowing Nintendo, they’ll definitely be reasons to poke around here. In general, the gameplay feels like a slightly tighter and more forgiving version of Mario Kart 8, so if you spent a ton of time there you’ll feel right at home here. When your kart gets smashed by an item or another player, your recovery time is snappier and you’re back in the competition quicker than in previous Mario Kart games. When an opponent cuts you off and steals an item box right before you can get to it, don’t stress it because they respawn almost immediately, giving you a chance for instant green shell vengeance. Gliders have been replaced with planes, underwater sections have been replaced with Wave Race-like boating areas, and you don’t customize your kart anymore, at least in the version I played. There were a lot of preset kart options to start with and presumably many more to unlock, though, so it seems like having lots of ways to show off your kart or character won’t be limited.
You can play Mario Kart World with up to 24 human players at the same time and there are tons of returning characters from the Mario series, although none from other Nintendo games like Mario Kart 8 had. It’s safe to say that Mario Kart World will be THE Mario Kart game for years to come, though, so who knows which characters from other series will show up here eventually. My favorite new character was Cow from Moo Moo Meadows, who is here to get revenge for all the times you drove into his family on the N64, probably. Most characters have different costumed versions  you can choose from the character select screen, but where things get a bit more complicated is that you can also change their costume mid-race by finding certain power-ups that appear to alter your stats. Lots of these items are food-based so you’ll get to see Cow eat a burger. Look, it’s his first time driving a kart and it’s crazy out there. Go easy on him.
We also noticed a bunch of characters that appear as racers against you but you can’t choose yourself just yet, like the Piantas from Super Mario Sunshine and the Conkdors from Super Mario 3D World, so we suspect they’ll be unlockable and the roster will only get bigger. There’s also some great new items like throwable hammers and a question block that gives you a ton of coins in a row. Some classic items even have altered functionality, like lightning not lasting as long or blue shells having cartoon phrases pop up when they hit you, but the coolest new upgrade we noticed is that every throwable item now automatically drags behind your kart without you having to hold down a button to do it. It’s one less thing to worry about, which is nice because you now have so many new things to worry about!
Knockout Tour is the biggest race mode ever included in this series and it feels awesome. You start out in the open world, driving around and hanging out with friends while your race populates with 23 other players. Then, you’ll all choose a set of interconnected Grand Prix tracks you want to race on. Once the race kicks off, you need to stay out of the bottom four in each segment or you’ll get eliminated and booted back to the open world. So, the field is culled each lap from 24, to 20, to 16, all the way until there are only four racers left for the final segment. It’s incredibly fun and the tracks, endless items, kart racers, and general chaos make every race feel absolutely frenetic. Think the final lap of Baby Park on Mario Kart: Double Dash where it’s chaos and clutter everywhere, but with the aggressive goal of making sure you’re taking down others constantly to advance.
This mode was incredibly fun. Going from 4th place to 12th place in a Mario Kart game has been a thing for ages, but going from 2nd to 22nd because a series of bad luck or poor decisions put you behind the pack is a brand new feeling, and watching that happen and then getting instantly eliminated from the entire race (or doing it to somebody else) is absolutely hilarious. Generally, this feature adds some much needed urgency and aggression to Mario Kart and it’s utterly thrilling. Nintendo has been experimenting with this elimination style gameplay with lots of their franchises in the past few years, like Mario 35 and F-Zero 99, but it feels like such a perfect fit for Mario Kart and we suspect it’s gonna be a massive hit with both kids and the streamer crowds. Knockout Tour modes last much longer than a typical race, assuming you don’t get knocked out of the whole thing super early.
Mario Kart World is $80!Everything we’ve seen and played is awesome and we can’t wait for it, but nothing about this game so far really screams “eighty dollar product.” Nintendo experimented with a $70 price tag on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and we suspect we’ll spend just as much time (or more) playing Mario Kart World throughout the Switch 2 lifespan, but it’s hard not to feel cynical about about this price, like Nintendo knows that Mario Kart 8 was the best-selling Switch game and one of the best-selling games of all time and that the successor will be a guaranteed hit, so hey, might as well upcharge us. If it came with a year of Switch Online or some sort of season pass of unlockable content it’d be a slightly easier pill to swallow, but as far as we know it doesn’t. Getting the game bundled with a Switch 2 drops the price down to $50 and since it will be there on the system’s launch day that’s likely how most players will get it, but still, the whole thing definitely stings a bit.
Regardless, Mario Kart World feels like the definitive Switch 2 launch game and will certainly be one of the defining games of the Switch 2 generation. The new open world format and Knockout Tour modes are massive new additions to the franchise, the visuals are gorgeous, the gameplay is a blast, and we can’t wait to play more, even if we wish it was a few bucks cheaper.
Brian Altano has been playing Mario Kart for 30+ years, and it's crazy that 10 of those years were spent with Mario Kart 8. We haven't seen Battle Mode for Mario Kart World yet, but he's still holding out hope that Block Fort can come back. Bring back Block Fort!"
"Thank your own personal deity—possibly Kratos—it’s Friday! Even though it’s Autumn for Aussies, it’s time to spring into ludicrous Spring Salesavings on Steam. If the picks of that litter don’t interest you, I’ve sniffed out console-based bargains on grand adventures, pulse-pounding action, or quirky indie gems; there’s a little something for everyone.

In retro news, I'm (somehow) celebrating the 23rd birthday of the OG Xbox, a console that blew my mind at launch (even though I was happily married to a PS2). This was the chunky vehicle that brought Microsoft into the console gaming world. And while it didn't have the prettiest design or the greatest library of games, it gave us two important contributions to gaming:Haloand Xbox Live.
While some N64 enthusiasts may argue thatGoldenEyepaved the way for quality console first-person shooters, it wasHalothat revolutionised the genre. Almost every FPS that came after Halo utilised its control scheme and a modified version of its health system. But where Halo truly succeeded was in providing console gamers with the first-of-its-kind 16-player LAN battles. This was the first shooter that made my PC gaming mates jealous, and I still own and adore myLimited Edition Crystal Xbox. Even though ants once tried to take it over and turn it into a very expensive vivarium.

"If your game library is looking a little sparse, now’s the perfect time to grab some absolute bangers at heavily discounted prices! Whether you’re after high-speed action, epic RPG adventures, or deep strategy experiences, this week’s deals have something for every kind of gamer.

In retro news, I'm celebrating the 21st birthday of a series black sheep that still sold many a GameCube,Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. As a remake of the '98 PS classic, this was a pretty surreal (and, in parts, misguided) love letter. It was as if Snake had emerged from a time machine, equipped with the control scheme and acrobatics ofMGS 2: Sons of Liberty. Helmed by Silicon Knights and injected with the ""cinematic flair"" of Hollywood action director Ryuhei Kitamura, the end result divided fans quicker than a cyber-ninja disarming Ocelot.
Upgrades like first-person aiming and being able to hang/drop from ledges were a double-edged sword. While they made Snake more powerful and adaptable, they also turned sections of his Shadow Moses op into a cakewalk. The level design, originally built for the PS1’s limitations, just wasn’t fully rebalanced to accommodate these new mechanics, and some re-recorded voice performances weren't ideal. Be that as it Mei [Ling], I still recall loving this at launch and adore the copy I own.

PC gamers have some stellar choices today. Cyberpunk 2077 ($36, down 60%) is the comeback king of gaming, having gone from a rocky launch to one of the most critically praised RPGs of recent years. And if you prefer grand strategy, Stellaris ($16, down 77%) is a steal.

"Star Wars Hunterspublisher Zynga has announced plans for the game to shut down entirely just nine months after it was released, and it appears plans to launch a PC version of Steam are scrapped.

The NaturalMotion-developed, free-to-download team-based battle arena game launched on Nintendo Switch and iOS and Android in June 2024. IGN’sStar Wars: Hunters reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Star Wars: Hunters’ lighthearted PvP fun is like a party at the Death Star: Impressive for a bit, but probably not a place you’ll want to hang around for too long.”
It seems the review was prescient, asZynga announcedthat “after careful consideration” it had decided the final content update for Star Wars: Hunters across all platforms would be released on April 15, with the game remaining playable until October 1, 2025.
“We understand this news may be disappointing and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly,” Zynga continued. “Your passion and dedication to the game and its community have meant the world to us, and we are committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process.”
Here are the logistics: on March 25, Season 5 will be extended by three weeks. Zynga will re-run events and shop bundles from the Season, and the Ranked Season will also be extended, giving players more time to hit Kyber 1 rank.
On April 15, the game’s final content update will be released for free and in-game purchases will be disabled across all platforms. New Support Hunter, Tuya, will join the game as part of the final update. Tuya will be available and playable for all users immediately at no cost, along with a slate of additional in-game content. Zynga will continue to run a final Ranked Mode leaderboard for players to compete in and run all battlefields and game modes in rotation.
And then, on October 1, online servers will officially shut down, and Star Wars: Hunters will no longer be playable beyond this point.
There’s no mention of the PC version,which was announced to launch on Steam in early access form this year, in the shutdown notice. Its Steam page now includes a notice that the game is “no longer available on the Steam store.”
Take-Two-owned Zynga is best known for mobile games FarmVille, Words with Friends, and CSR Racing, but with Star Wars: Hunters it branched out to console for the first time. Similarly, Star Wars: Hunters was meant to be the first Zynga-published game to launch on PC.
“The success of Star Wars: Hunters on mobile and Nintendo Switch devices has led to our decision to expand the game to PC,” said Yaron Leyvan, executive vice president, games, at Zynga, back in November.
“This is something our community of fans have been asking for and we are very excited to welcome even more players to Vespaara. This moment also marks a milestone for Zynga as we bring one of our games to PC for the first time.”
There are still a number of Star Wars video games in the works, including Respawn Entertainment's third Star Wars Jedi game andBit Reactor's turn-based tactics game set to be revealed at Star Wars Celebration 2025.

"It's official: TheNintendo Switch 2is coming very soon.June 5, to be exact! Following a lengthyNintendo Directthat showed off new games for the highly-anticipated console alongside more information on the Switch 2 hardware itself, some items are starting to go up for preorder. This includesmicroSD Express cards, which are the only storage cards theSwitch 2 will be compatible with.

Quite a few of these cards have already started to sell out, but there's a shining light at the end of the tunnel coming from GameStop. The retailer has created its own line of microSD Express cards that are available to preorder and come in varying capacities, from 256GB ($49.99) to 512GB ($84.99) to 1TB ($149.99). These are set to release on June 5, the same day as the console. You can preorder these cards below, but to stay up to date on more cards as they come back in stock keep ourhub page for microSD Express cardsbookmarked.
The microSD Express cards have been disappearing fast from online retailers, so if you've been hoping to secure a storage upgrade ahead of the Switch 2's release you'll want to be quick to get your preorders in. If you're unsure if you'll need the extra space, it's worth noting that the Switch 2 is set to come with256GB of internal storage, which is quite a bit more than the original Switch's 32GB. If you have an ever-expanding library of Switch games, it's always worth it to pick up some extra storage.
Outside of the additional storage, if you're curious when preorders will pop up for the console itself, make sure to mark your calendar for April 9. It's worth keeping ourSwitch 2 preorder guidebookmarked as well so you can stay up to date on when it drops and where it's available to purchase on the day. We've also put together a list full of tips tohelp increase your chances of getting a Switch 2. The countdown has begun, and we're here to help you secure a Switch 2 on day one.

"We live in an era of getting things shipped straight to your home, without needing to leave your house. Pretty much anything I could ever want can be sent directly to me in seemingly no time flat. It's an incredible thing, and yet part of me still yearns for the experience of getting something in person. It feels like it's more of an actual event and a memory you'll have forever.

With theNintendo Switch 2 preordersstarting soon, Best Buyhas announcedthat customers will have the option to pick up the new console at their local store at the stroke of midnight EST. It's the earliest possible time fans can get their hands on the Switch 2, withWalmart offering free deliveriesbefore 9 a.m. on June 5. While having it shipped directly to me would be the easiest path, the idea of actually going somewhere to secure the console with my own two hands appeals to me a lot more. If I do end up getting a preorder for the Switch 2, I'm going to choose to wait in line and make a big deal out of it.
Editor's Note: Due to tariffs in the U.S.,Switch 2 preorders have been delayedat Best Buy.
Best Buy preorders for the Switch 2 console, Switch 2 games, and its accessoriesbegin on Wednesday, April 9. If you're able to secure a console before stock disappears, you'll be able to choose preorder pickup at your local Best Buy location. You cansign up to get notificationsdirectly from Best Buy about all things Switch 2. Best Buy stated that most stores will be open at midnight ET on launch day— June 5— for pickup.
You can always use Google Maps to find your local Best Buy, but you can also use the tech retailer'sstore locater pageto find all locations in your surrounding area. You can widen the range of your search by simply expanding the map and see if the closest store is actually worth the drive.
In case you aren't familiar with Best Buy's memberships, there are a total of three. There's the free My Best Buy membership (which you'll need to preorder), My Best Buy Plus, and My Best Buy Total. Only the Plus and Total memberships are offering rewards for Nintendo purchases, but the rewards themselves are worth considering. You'll get a $20 certificate for every $150 you spend on Nintendo games and gear.
This sounds great in theory, if the Switch 2 itself was a qualifying purchase, but thefine print of the offer statesthat all Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 hardware is disqualified. With the price of someNintendo Switch 2 gamessitting at $80, though, you could easily spend over $150 with just two new game preorders.

"It's Mario's big day, and Nintendo's plumber is getting a new Lego set with quite a few pieces in the box. Lego has revealed a new Mario Kart Lego set today, March 10, with almost 2,000 pieces and an ""18+"" age recommendation, arriving on May 15, 2025. It's available topreorder now at the LEGO Store.

Originally spottedpopping up on some store listings, Lego has officially unveiled the set, which includes both Mario and his Standard Kart from the Mario Kart series. It's a detailed model, meant for display and decor, with a special stand meant to showcase Mario and his kart at various angles.
OnLego's site, the company clocks the Mario Kart build at 1,972 pieces with a recommended ""18+"" Ages rating. This is due to the complexity of the build, it seems, and the intention of the product versus sets meant for play. ""This building kit is part of a large assortment of LEGO Sets for Adults designed for people who enjoy hands-on creative activities to relax,"" Lego said in its description.
Here we go! 🏆 Launching May 15th 🏁#LEGOSuperMario#MarioKartpic.twitter.com/NZ13sCIFHo
The tenor of this build certainly seems aimed at the older, ""advanced"" builder of Lego. It also works with the Lego Builder app, which offers in-app building instructions and tools that let builders zoom and rotate around a 3D image of the model as they build. The final result is a posable, Lego-made Mario in his Kart.
Lego and Mario have built up a solid relationship over the years, with the collaboration resulting in numerous crossover sets. There's the Lego Super Mario line, which erred more on the side of interactive play andincorporated some game elements into its set design.
Still, some other options were aimed more at the older crowd who might like to build for relaxation and display over interactivity, likethe Pirahna Plantandthe Lego Super Mario World set featuring Mario and Yoshi. Some offer activities for the kids, while others offer nostalgia and complex builds for the adults.
The Lego Mario Kart build is up for pre-order now, at a price point of $169.99 / £139.99 / €169.99. The set will fully launch on May 15, 2025.

"Palworldhas a big new update that adds crossplay across all platforms among many other new features.

Update v0.5.0 also lets players store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds. A new storage system has 10 times the capacity of the regular Palbox. Not only can guild members access it, but it can be used as a personal storage with private settings.
Elsewhere, you can now change your character’s appearance without affecting armor stats (transmog), there’s a photo mode, blueprint upgrading, and dedicated servers for Mac, among other changes detailed in the patch notes below.
Developer Pocketpair said it’s working on adding dedicated servers for the PlayStation 5 version and will release them at some point in the future.
Palworld has had an incredible32 million playerssince its early access launch in January 2024. The studio haslaid out a content roadmap for Palworld's 2025that looks fairly lengthy; alongside crossplay, there is an ""ending scenario"" and more new content on the way for the hugely popular creature-catching survival game.
Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC a year ago, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developercouldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success,signing a deal with Sonyto form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP, and launching the game on PS5.
Looming over all this isa lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, who seek ""an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages"" on the grounds that Palworld has allegedly infringed on ""multiple"" patent rights.Pocketpair has provided an update, identifying the patents the studio is allegedly infringing, and it has since tweaked how players summon Pals in Palworld, apparently in response. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in court, saying: “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”

"Final Fantasy VII Rebirthis now available at its lowest price so far.Woot is offering the game for $32.99for PS5, a significant drop from its regular price of $69.99. For those who have been waiting to pick it up, this is a great opportunity to do so at a significant discount, and potentially one of the best deals of the year.

It's hard to imagine the game dropping any further in price anytime soon, making this likely the best opportunity to buy it at the lowest price possible in 2025. With such a steep discount, I wouldn't be surprising if it sells out quickly, so if you're interested in picking it up, don't wait too long.
In our 9/10 review, Michael Higham called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth“a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth,” and “an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long.” While it takes some creative liberties in reimagining the classic, he described it as “thrilling and unexpectedly impactful.”
Woot, an Amazon-owned online retailer, is known for offering limited-time deals on video games, tech, and more. It's a trusted source for deep discounts, and one we frequently recommend on IGN for finding some of the best gaming bargains around.

"Nintendo is updating how digital Nintendo Switch games work with what it’s calling Virtual Game Cards ahead of the impending launch of Nintendo Switch 2.

The company explored how Virtual Game Cards will have players rethinking their purchases during today’sMarch 2025 Nintendo Direct. We’ll surely have a better understanding of this feature update when it rolls out with a system update in late April, but for now, it appears digital Switch games will now be more clear about where they’re allowed to be played and who you can play them with.
The idea is that Virtual Game Cards allow players to link two of their Switch consoles together and transfer their games between them. If you buy Super Mario Odyssey digitally on your original Switch, for example, it sounds like you'll be free to bring it over to another Switch family device with little to no issue (after the consoles are first paired). Managing your digital Virtual Game Card library can be done on a separate page that connects your consoles together, and it seems choosing where you're playing your games is simple.
Adding to the newfound functionality is a very Nintendo take on what many players refer to as game sharing. The company says you'll be able to ""lend out"" your purchased games to other members of your Family Group. It's a feature that gives gamers the freedom to choose one game, one of up to eight of their group members, and let them borrow that game for up to two weeks. A single game can only be shared with one member at a time, and it appears you'll lose access to your game for that period, but it is a streamlined way to let friends and family try out some of your favorite titles.
The headline here is that Nintendo wants Virtual Game Cards to be “as flexible and convenient” as physical game cartridges. Digital game owners will be free to move their titles not only between another Switch device but, for a limited time, with friends as well. It's unclear how exactly Virtual Game Cards will work with Nintendo Switch 2, specifically, but it's clear the feature was made with the upcoming sequel console in mind.
We'll hopefully learn more about how Virtual Game Cards might work whenthe Switch 2 Direct premieres next week. For everything else revealed during today's March 2025 Nintendo Direct, you can see everything else announcedhere.

"Here are the best deals for Tuesday, March 11. HIghlights include rare discounts on PS5 Dualsense controllers from Lenovo, an Asus Chromebook for just over $100 from Best Buy, the coveted AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D back in stock on Amazon at a non marked-up price, big savings on speedy Samsung SSDs, power banks for your handheld gaming PCs, and more.

Lenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.
Last year the 9th generation iPad was the least expensive iPad you could get brand new and with warranty. It was regularly priced at $179, but it went out of stock pretty much everywhere starting from Black Friday. Fortunately, it's back for one final harrah; right now, Walmart has it available for delivery for only $179 shipped. Seriously though, this deal probably won't last much longer so don't hesitate.
Amazon is offering this Iniu 20,000mAh 65W USB Power Bank for only $21.59 after you clip the 40% off coupon on the product page (if you don't see it, try applying promo code ""WN9GQJRA"").

Samsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99.

If you're in the process of building out a new gaming PC and you're looking for the best gaming processor, this is it. Right now, the recently releasedAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DAM5 desktop processor is back in stock on Amazon and Best Buy at its retail price of $479 shipped. This is the official launch price with zero markup, and it's not bundled with anything you don't want or need. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming processor currently on the market (across both AMD and Intel) and a better choice for gamers than the more expensiveIntel Core Ultra 9 285K.
AMD's new Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards have been released, but just like their Nvidia counterparts, they're mostly out of stock and impossible to find at retail pricing. Don't fret, however, because you can still get these GPUs equipped in a prebuilt gaming PC for a reasonable price. The Radeon RX 9070 GPUs are the new mid-range champions of this generation. Both cards offer phenomenal performance while undercutting their Nvidia competition.
Apple's best earbuds are on sale today. Amazon is offering the second generationApple AirPods Prowireless noise-canceling earbuds for only $169.99 shipped, a savings of 32% and the best AirPods deal so far this year. That's about $20 more than theApple AirPods 4 with ANC, down from its usual $70 price premium. Between the two, the AirPods Pro is stillthe superior earbudsbecause it offers better sound quality and noise cancelation.
Chromebooks aren't exactly gaming-minded PCs, but they're compact, lightweight, great for productivity on the go, and in this case, a bargain. As part of Best Buy's Deal of the Day, you can pick up thisAsus 14"" Chromebookfor just $119 shipped after a $180 off instant discount, although I'd say the MSRP is a tad inflated. Even so, that's still a fantastic deal for a chromebook that features a relatively recent 8-core MediaTek processor which pairs well with Google Chrome OS.
You can grab this 10,000mAh power bank for only $8.99 after you clip the 10% off and 40% off clippable coupons on the product page. We very rarely see 10,000mAh power banks listed for under $10 so grab this one while you can. This will charge a Nintendo Switch from 0% to 100% about 1.9 times.
For a limited time, Hulu is offering four months of Disney+ and Hulu Basic (Ad-Supported) Bundle for just $2.99 per month. The normal cost of this subscription is $10.99 per month. This deal only comes around a handful of times per year and worth it for just the Disney+ subscription alone.

"Nintendo Today is a new app from the Super Mario Bros. company itself that aims to bring Nintendo news to players a bit more directly than ever before.

Video game legend Shigeru Miyamoto spilled the beans on the company’s latest news push as a last-minute stinger during today’sMarch 2025 Nintendo Direct. This all-in-one phone application is available to download via the Apple App Store and Google Play today and comes with a variety of perks for die-hard Nintendo fans to be aware of.
This hub for all things Nintendo serves as a daily calendar and news machine to drip feed information directly to players as it happens. Miyamoto uses the example that, after the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct premieres next week, fans will be able to log into the Nintendo Today app to catch all of the updates, with more news arriving “daily” from there.
It’s a bit more direct than the average Nintendo Direct and encourages fans to keep up to date with news, even if there’s not a massive announcement to be made. As days roll on, you’ll see characters from Mario, Pikmin, Animal Crossing, and more show up to welcome you to a new day. The feed will also be updated not only with news but Nintendo-themed content, too. Highlights shown during the Nintendo Direct include a Pikmin 4 comic called “Too Stuck to Pluck” and Pearls of Wisdom from Animal Crossing’s resident shell-cracking Otter, Pascal.
Nintendo Today isn’t quite the Zelda or Super Smash Bros. bombshell many fans hoped to see round out today’s Direct, but it’s at least another channel for fans to tune into. For more onMetroid,Pokémon, and everything else announced during today’s March 2025 Nintendo Direct, you can click righthere.

"Today's Nintendo Direct announcement of anew Virtual Game Cards feature for sharing games between systemsis being met with surprise and interest from fans. But it's also raising some questions, most notably one about the Nintendo Switch 2, thanks to a fine print footnote on an official Nintendo webpage.

The question comes fromthis page, which explains how Virtual Game Cards work. Most of what's here is fairly straightforward (well, as straightforward as anything is). But there's a fascinating footnote at the bottom of the page, tied to the feature of moving games between Switch systems. It reads:
What's throwing people here is the phrasing ""Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games."" The part about ""exclusive games"" is straightforward enough, as we already knew there would be games that are only playable on the Nintendo Switch 2, and not the current Switch. But we also know thatthe Nintendo Switch 2 is backwards compatible with Switch 1(mostly). So what is a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition game?
Some fans are suggestingthis is a subtle confirmationthatthere will be some ""enhanced editions""of existing Switch games that add new features or improved performance, only for Switch 2. If that's the case, it would make sense that purchasing them on Switch 2 would not allow them to be shared with a Switch 1, because they simply wouldn't function correctly and would effectively be a different edition of the version on Switch 1.
That's not the only theory though. Some others are speculating that this doesn't confirm anything, merely suggests an unfortunate situation where users won't be able to use Nintendo's shiny new Virtual Game Card feature to send some or all Nintendo Switch 2 games backward to Switch 1, even if they're the same game. It's also possible this doesn't suggest anything in particular, but merely opens the door in the future for third-parties to release Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of games if they feel like it.
We reached out to Nintendo to try to get a clarification, but were told by a spokesperson they would have an answer for us on April 2,conveniently the day of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. Just hang in there a little bit longer, everyone.

This weekend at Amazon, you can take home a physical copy of the game for just $24. Over 60 new levels are featured in this installment, with dozens of new music tracks, too.

"In general, I am a very practical person when it comes to spending money. I buy the essentials I need and occasionally a video game when it goes on sale, but usually I don't really venture beyond that. It wasn't until just last year that I even considered buying something as unnecessary as a LEGO set. Even though I loved building LEGO sets as a kid, at some point I guess I just got older and stopped.

In part, that's probably becauseLEGO is really expensive. While there are some cool sets for under $25, anything tied to some sort of movie or video game franchise always comes at a higher cost. Which is why it took me so long to convince myself to buy the LEGO Super Mario Piranha Plant. It'sbeen on sale since October of last yearfor under $50 but I only recently decided my desk needed a new potted plant.
I first started considering this set after reading throughIGN's build of the Piranha Plant. I have been a fan of pretty muchevery Mario gamethere's been so far, and this set just seemed like the perfect way to display my love of the franchise. LEGO has a lot offlower sets in its botanical linethat would look great on my desk too, but none of them are as whimsically terrifying as this little guy.
Now that I've actually built the set, I am really happy to have it on my desk. Every time I look at it I can imagine that I'm somewhere in the Mushroom Kingdom with my little potted Piranha Plant I've been cultivating during work hours. And while I love the end result of the set, I enjoyed building it just as much. I was able to put it together in one afternoon, but it was still challenging enough to hold my attention the entire time. It's currently the onlyLEGO Nintendo setI own, but I'm definitely considering adding more alongside it after my experience.
Like I mentioned above, the world of LEGO is an expensive one. With the company releasing newsets targeted at adultsevery year with price tags of $200 or more, it can be tempting to spend way too much on something awesome. Unless you're made of money, there's a fine line between treating yourself to something you love and bankrupting yourself in an avalanche of plastic bricks.
The fact that this Mario LEGO set was under $50 was enough for me to feel good about buying it for myself. I got to spend hours building it and seeing it sitting next to me brings me a little bit of happiness each day. Is that little bit of happiness worth more than $50? Probably. But that's just how much I'm willing to spend.

"Amazon’s Big Spring Sale will soon reach its conclusion today, March 31, so you've got until the end of the day to secure a great deal. While it might not have the same hype as Black Friday or Prime Day, the discounts speak for themselves, and there's so many great offers to choose from still— including the lowest prices of the year on tech like Apple AirPods, Kindles, Fire TV Sticks, and must-have items like50 series GPUs, andPokémon TCG cardsback in stock for a limited time.

Amazon’s dedicatedSpring Sale hub has plenty of deals, but we’ve done the heavy lifting for you on the final day of the sale, highlighting only the best discountsactuallyworth your time. Every deal we feature is either at its lowest-ever price, matches its best price of the year so far, or is so hotly sought after we can't help but mention it. We’re keeping this list fresh with real-time updates, so you won’t miss out on the biggest savings before the sale ends.
There are already some incredible doorbuster deals in the Amazon Spring Sale 2025. One of the best is theINIU 10K power bank for just $9with code S7LY7824 and clipping the 50% coupon – a record low price. It’s an absolute must-buy, especially for iPhone users, but even beyond that, it’s just anoutstanding power bankat an unbeatable price. If you grab only one thing from this sale, make it this. You can findmore coupons worth clippingto score additional savings on books, robot vacuums and more.
Other tech deals include the standard slate ofApple products, likeAirPodsand thenewest Apple Watch, as well as Amazon devices likeFire TV.
It'd be silly not to mention thelatest round of Pokémon TCG stock at Amazonduring the sale, with elusive Elite Trainer Boxes like Twilight Masquerade available again, alongside a slew of other hot booster sets likeSurging Sparks.
One of our favorite deals during theSpring Sale is The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Editions, all at all time low discounts, and in thebuy two get one freedeal. It's one of the best offers we've seen all year.Sunrise on the Reaping, the new Hunger Games novel, should also be on your radar.
Other books in the sale include chart-topper Onyx Storm, and its fellow Empyrean series booksIron FlameandFourth Wing, alongside theHarry Potter Illustrated Books.
For just individual book deals, we also love theSkyrim Library, a three-volume collection of texts, now down to just$49.99 when clipping the coupon at Amazon. A gloriously good deal for a magnificent set of books. We've also seen plenty ofcomics, likeUltimate Spider-Man, and even select vinyl (also within the 3 for 2 promotion) included in the deals.
LEGO sets are getting more expensive, but they always seem to get solid discounts during these types of sales. Some of thebest LEGO dealsfrom the current sale include discounts on theLEGO Wednesday collaborationas well as some very cozyLEGO Animal Crossing sets. Some of ourfavorite board gamesfor both families and adults are included in the sale. We've also seen tons of deals on 90's comebacks includingaction figures,plushies,Nerf gunsand evenBop It! toys(that apparently still exist).
Amazon has also discounted tons ofindividual movies and TV shows, includingold-school Warner Bros. cartoonsandfilms directed by David Lynch.
It's always the right time to get accessories you actually need, but it's even better to get them on sale. That said, Amazon has discounts on variousPS Portal accessory deals. My other favorites that are worth considering includeAudible Premium Plus for $0.99, theApple AirPods Pro 2 for $169.99,Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth for $32.99, and65"" LG C4 4K OLED Smart TV for $1,397.
The Amazon Spring Sale (March 25-31) couldn’t come at a better time. With no major shopping holidays between now and Memorial Day, this is one of the best opportunities to score great deals before summer. WhilePrime DayandBlack Fridaymight bring even steeper discounts, those are months away – if you’re looking to save right now, this sale is your best bet.
That said, strategic shopping always wins. If you’re eyeing a big-ticket item like aTVorKindlebut don’t need it immediately, waiting for a larger sale could be worth it. Want to make sure you’re getting the best possible price? Tools likeCamelCamelCamellet you track pricing history, helping you spot real deals from the ones that justlookgood. It’s a trick we swear by to make sure every recommendation is truly worth your money.

And finally, there are plenty ofvideo game deals from Wootwhich also includes FF7 Rebirth, Metaphor: ReFantazio, Super Mario RPG and more.

"I didn’t think we’d see a proper Pokémon TCG restock this early in 2025. Honestly, I was betting on summer at best, but here we are with actual product showing up on Amazon and not behind some sketchy paywalled Discord server. While the internet’s currently losing its mind over Prismatic Evolutions and burning money chasing stock alerts for Rival Destinies, the smart play is scooping up the older sets that just hit Amazon Global. We’re talking Scarlet and Violet era stuff, Sword and Shield throwbacks, and boxes that were basically extinct six months ago.

This is the kind of flood the TCG community needed. Not just for collectors trying to complete sets, but for anyone who’s tired of battling bots for ETBs like it’s the Hunger Games. There’s a real mix available right now: Booster Bundles, Premium Collections, tins with actual storage value. And yes, even a few deals that make it feel like Amazon’s trying to keep the vibe positive. If you’re chasing big pulls like Greninja SIR or Pikachu ex SIR, or just need to stock up on sleeves and dice, this is the best stock refreshes we’ve seen in a while.
AliExpress is currently offering theSony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphonesfor only $225.18 after coupon code:IFP7FJZis applied during checkout. This product is stocked in a US warehouse, so it ships free and arrives within about a week. This is an import model with a warranty that won't be honored in the United States. AliExpress makes up for it with a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days.
In our glowingSony WH1000XM5 review, Kevin Lee wrote that ""The Sony WH-1000XM5 is hands down the best sounding and most impressive noise-canceling headphones around. They demand a high premium but the cost of audio excellence is well worth it with this pair of headphones.""
The real deal here is the fact that theTwilight MasqueradeElite Trainer Box is actually in stock. Seeing it available without a 200% markup or sketchy third-party seller feels borderline miraculous. You’re getting nine booster packs, a full-art Teal Mask Ogerpon promo, and all the usual ETB goodies like energy cards, condition markers, and themed sleeves.
It’s not every day you seeBrilliant StarsBuild and Battle Boxes in stock, let alone without having to navigate the wild west of resale sites. At $63.34, this one comes with four booster packs and a pre-release promo card, which makes it a solid pickup for collectors looking to flesh out their Sword and Shield era sets. Arceus VSTAR headlines the expansion, and the pull potential here still holds up.
Among Us 4-Pack on Steam is a sneaky little deal that gives you four copies of the game for the price of one, making it dangerously easy to rope your friends into a night of trust issues and vent-related betrayal. It supports cross-platform play, customizable settings, and chaotic emergency meetings that usually end with the wrong person getting ejected. If you’ve somehow missed the social deduction chaos, now’s the perfect time to catch up and take three crewmates down with you.
TheHisuian Electrode V Boxis back in stock at Amazon for $42.45, which is a win considering how sporadically these pop up. It's one of those V boxes that slipped under the radar when it first launched, but now that Sword and Shield-era product is drying up it’s worth grabbing. You get a foil Hisuian Electrode V promo, a regular Electrode foil, an oversized version (because why not), and four booster packs to rip through.
This limited-edition snack box is a flavor-packed tribute toAssassin’s Creed Shadows, blending premium Japanese treats with collectible game merch in a way that feels like an edible side quest. You get 15 unique snacks, a full bag of exclusive Kit Kats, a custom Tenugui towel, and even an in-game item called The Hourglass that’s only available through this box. With artwork prints, a detailed snack guide, and a box sleeve that transforms into a display-worthy poster, it’s more than just snacks.
Seeing theShining FatesPikachu V Box on Amazon again feels like spotting a shiny in the wild. At $49.96 it’s not exactly a steal, but having it in stock is the real value. This box comes with a foil Pikachu V promo, an oversized version for flair, and four Shining Fates booster packs. That means a legit shot at pulls from one of the most hype-filled sets of the Sword and Shield era.
TheSurging SparksBooster Bundle is actually in stock at Amazon for $47.95, which is kind of a miracle considering how fast this set’s been disappearing. You get six booster packs from the newest Scarlet and Violet expansion, which includes some major chase cards like Pikachu ex SIR and Latias ex. If you missed the chaos of launch day or couldn’t snag a bundle without battling bots, this is your chance to catch up.
I want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.
This phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.
I can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.
RimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.
This SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.
I never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.
I think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.

Whether you’re reliving the golden age of RPGs or playing them for the first time, this bundle is the ultimate way to experience Final Fantasy’s roots. The limited-time sale price of $52.49, down from $74.99, makes this an easy win for any RPG fan.

It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.
If you’re tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend.

Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.
Why buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend.

If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.
Still using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger.

These aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.
These Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.

For those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says ""powerful Pokémon"" like an angry robot penguin).
I'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.
If somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.
Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).
If you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, ""I really need to delete some games,"" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.
Samsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room.

Gamers get Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and VRR, plus four HDMI 2.1 ports. At $499.99, this is one of the best deals for an OLED right now.
Samsung’s S90D OLED TVis a beast, packing AI-powered 4K upscaling, Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for silky smooth gameplay, and Dolby Atmos for immersive sound. Real Depth Enhancer makes everything look more lifelike, and PANTONE validation ensures accurate color reproduction. At $300 off, this is a great price for a high-end 65” OLED TV.
Sony’s WH-CH520 headphonesoffer 50 hours of battery life, customizable sound settings, and a lightweight, comfortable design. Multipoint connection makes switching between devices seamless, and DSEE upscaling improves compressed audio. At just $35.95, these are one of the best budget wireless headphones out there today.
Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 bring top-tier noise cancellation, a Tensor A1 chip for AI-powered audio enhancements, and large 11mm drivers for rich bass.

Enshrouded is a survival RPG with deep crafting, intense combat, and massive co-op potential. Play solo or team up with up to 16 friends, build custom bases, and fight through a dark, mysterious world. It’s still in early access, but at $23.99, it’s worth jumping in now aswe gave it 8/10.

"Nintendo Switch 2 includes an all-new GameShare feature.

Previously, players could pass a second Joy-Con to a friend and play together locally, but now that feature has been extended to let you play locally with another Nintendo Switch 2 system with just one copy of a game.
Even ""games that require multiple screens"" can be played if one person owns a compatible game. You can temporarily share a game with up to three other local systems at a time, including OG Nintendo Switch.
GameShare also support online play with other Switch 2 systems, although it's only available with compatible games such as Captain Toad Treasure Tracker, Super Mario 3D World, Super Mario Odyssey, Big Brain Academy, and Club House Games 51 Worldwide Classics, which is getting a free update on Switch.
Please note, however, Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games can only be shared with Nintendo Switch 2 system.
You can catch up oneverything announced at the Nintendo Directtoday right here.

"It's the day before theNintendo Switch 2 Direct, with less than 24 hours to go until Nintendo reveals its plans for its next console. A new Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filing could, potentially, point to some of those plans, at least when it comes to its Switch 2 controller lineup.

As spotted onFamiboardsand picked up by Nintendo-centric sites likeGoNintendo, an FCC filing emerged yesterday, March 31, from Nintendo. Under product code ""BEE-008,"" it looks to be a registration for a new game controller. Some fans believe this to be the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.
It bears mentioning that this is speculaton, as Nintendo hasn't confirmed plans for a Switch 2 Pro Controller yet. However, a few features do seem to indicate this would be a Pro Controller, like Bluetooth and NFC capability.
The big thing to note about this filing, if this is the Switch 2 Pro Controller, is that it could include a headphone jack. The original Switch 1 Pro Controller didn't have a headphone jack of any kind, while controllers like the DualSense and Xbox Series controllers do feature a port.
This would be a nice quality-of-life feature, if this holds true for the Switch 2 Pro Controller.Past Nintendo filingshave given us a glimpse of the company's plans in advance, so there's some reason to entertain speculation about this controller. We've yet to see it though, so barring any more leaks between now and tomorrow, we'll likely have confirmation once Nintendo announces its full plans for the Switch 2.
The Switch 2 Directairs tomorrow at 6am PT / 9am ET on Nintendo's channels. We'll be getting a ""closer look"" at the Switch 2, after its initial reveal earlier this year, and hopefully a lot of solid information leading up to a potential release date.
Nintendo has confirmed the Switch 2 Direct will run for an hour. Two Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2 presentations with hands-on gameplay have been scheduled for April 3 and April 4 as well, starting at 7am PT each day.

"Today's Nintendo Direct ended in a surprising and rather strange way, with the announcement of a brand new Tomodachi Life game after over a decade-long hiatus for the series. It's calledTomodachi Life: Living the Dreamand it's not coming out until 2026.

The original Tomodachi Life was first released back in 2013 in Japan and 2014 overseas, and is a social sim game featuring Nintendo's Mii characters. Both in the original and now in Living the Dream, the Miis live in a small community together, and players are able to have Miis with different personalities and stats interact with one another. Over time, the Miis can form different kinds of relationships with one another, and watch their lives evolve through different activities. Miis can even get married and have kids.
From the trailer we saw, it looks like Living the Dream will feature a lot of the same things. We see Miis playing games together, dancing, smelling flowers, fighting one another, exercising, sleeping, shopping, and chatting in that goofy, bizarre robot voice way that they do. We don't have too many details on how Living the Dream will move the series forward, though it does look significantly prettier than its 3DS predecessor.
Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream won't be out until 2026, so we'll have to wait for more details on what it entails between now and then. For more, check outeverything announced at Nintendo Direct March 2025.

"It’s March 10, 2025, so that means Nintendo is back with a slew of Mario Day reveals revolving around everyone’s favorite Mushroom Kingdom mascot.

As highlighted by the MAR10 hashtag floating around social media today, March 10 has served as Nintendo’s official (and clever) Mario holiday for the last few years. The appropriately named celebration always features announcements and treats for fans of the iconic plumber, and this year is no different. Although we’ve not yet seen anything quite on the level of2024’s reveals, which included the promise thatThe Super Mario Bros. Movie 2 will arrive next year, 2025 has already delivered some exciting Mario news.
Just hours before MAR10 Day officially kicked off, Nintendo announced that the Super Mario Bros. 3 original soundtrack had been added to its Nintendo Music application for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. That means earworms like the World 1 Map tune Ground BGM are only a tap away, but there are even more deal sweeteners now available for Mario fans. Last Thursday, as an early surprise, Nintendo added the Game Boy releases of Mario’s Picross and Donkey to its library of Switch Online titles. It’s all available to help make MAR10 Day feel a bit more special right now.
Here we go! 🏆 Launching May 15th 🏁#LEGOSuperMario#MarioKartpic.twitter.com/NZ13sCIFHo
Nintendo hasn’t been shy when it comes to adding more Lego sets based on its iconic cast of characters. While Mario has gotten plenty of love in this department in the past, thenew Mario Kart buildrevealed as part of today’s festivities might be one of the toy line’s coolest yet. It’ll cost a whopping $170 when it drops May 15, 2025, but it also manages to pack in quite a bit of detail into the 1,972-piece kit.
If you’re looking for every way you could possibly celebrate Mario Day, this new sweepstakes has you covered. As seen on theMy Nintendo website, Nintendo account holders can now spend Platinum points to enter into a sweepstakes that will offer select users the chance to win a four-night stay at Universal Orlando Resort that includes access to each of its four theme parks. It’ll come with the freedom to enjoy Super Nintendo World when its Orlando location opens this May.
JetBlue has partnered with Nintendo to create the Cloudtop Cruiser, a sky-blue aircraft featuring Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and Bowser that will be used to transport fans. If flights aren’t your thing, you can enjoy more from Mario Day by participating in a Mario Kart 8 Deluxe community challenge that gives players until March 17 to complete 1 million in-game laps, collectively. A reward of 310 Platinum points will be gifted to those who participate in the challenge.
Meanwhile, Mario fans located in New York can visit the Nintendo store from 1pm – 4pm ET today to chat with Mario via an LED wall. Then, from 4pm – 7pm ET, the same location will offer meet-and-greet opportunities with Mario and Luigi. Those who can’t make the trek to New York may still be in luck, as starting March 15 from 12pm – 4pm. local time,select GameStop locationswill allow players to demo Nintendo Switch titles such as Super Mario Party Jamboree, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and more. The GameStop events will also include Nintendo-themed giveaways.
Another Mario Day tradition involves respectable discounts for some of the video game plumber's most iconic titles, and 2025 is no different. On the My Nintendo Store and eShop alone are a bevy of deals for games like Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Super Mario RPG, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, and more. You can see a list of a few of the MAR10 Day deals we spottedhere.
While die-hard Mario Bros. fans do what they can to celebrate Mario’s big day, others are simply taking the time to celebrate on social media. You’ll be hard pressed to make it out of today without seeing enough fan creations to stop an army of Koopa Troopas in their tracks, but we’ve gone through the trouble to include some of our favorites below.

"Nintendo fans are presumably eager to get their hands on theNintendo Switch 2. But one in particular seems a bit more eager than most, as he's already starting the line in front of the Nintendo New York store two months in advance to ensure he gets one.

YouTuber ChickenDog has started making the rounds as the ""first"" person to line up for the Nintendo Switch 2 at the New York store location. He started on April 5, two months before the planned June 5 launch of the new Nintendo console, andhe said he plans to camp outand record updates as he does so.
First in line for the Nintendo Switch 2 gonna be camping out for 2 months can’t wait to see what happens throughout my journey!#NintendoSwitch2#NintendoNYC#nintendostoreuspic.twitter.com/Vb7wrmk52y
The ""camping out"" is a little more in the colloquial sense, as ChickenDogclarified in an update videothat he has an AirBnB and hotel, as well as friends in the area, so he won't be braving the elements for two straight months. He's also got a crew of friends helping him hold the spot down when he's not physically there.
It’s raining for day 3 staying strong 💪pic.twitter.com/lkFVycX2xW
There's certainly a history of Nintendo fans camping out for big console and game releases,including a month-long wait for the Nintendo Switch. It seems like ChickenDog is looking to follow in those footsteps, waiting out the two months for Switch 2.
The YouTuber plans on recording and uploading content while he's out there, so head over to ChickenDog's YouTube if you want to follow all the updates day-after-day. Even without a tent or sleeping bag, waiting out for two months is a long, long time, so best of luck and some sunny skies to him.
Assuming ChickenDog stays the course, he'll need to hand over $450 just for a Switch 2, or $500 if he wants the Mario Kart world bundle. That is, unless the price goes up in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have already caused Nintendo to delay Switch 2 pre-orders.

"Netflix's President of Games, Alain Tascan, is expecting a future generation that relies less on gaming consoles as major players like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo push forward with new hardware.

The lead of the streaming giant’s video game division shared his thoughts on how gaming fans might soon play their favorite titles during an interview withThe Game Businessthat took place following a Netflix presentation in San Francisco. During the event itself, Tascan was asked if the streamer had any intention of taking a crack at console gaming, but he’s not so sure younger gamers are even interested in what something like a PlayStation 6 could bring to the table.
“[When it comes to] console, we started to look at the future where the platform is agnostic,” he explained. “Look at the younger generation. Are eight year-olds and 10 year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6? I am not sure. They are wanting to interact with any digital screen, whatever it is, wherever it is, even in the car. With console you’re thinking about high definition, you’re thinking about the controller […] If we look at this older model, I think it will restrain us.”
Tascan told The Game Business that he’s got a soft spot for console gaming despite his concerns, specifically calling out Nintendo’s Wii as a personal favorite. He’s spent many years at studios such as EA, Ubisoft, and Epic Games in the past, so the idea of more traditional console game releases is far from foreign for him. For Netflix, though, things are trending in a different direction.
While the company has a proven track record for creating game adaptations for its IPs with subscription add-ons like Stranger Things 3: The Game, Too Hot to Handle: Love Is a Game, and more, it’s also experimented with giving users access to notable, familiar games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition. Each game can be played straight from a mobile phone if a subscriber chooses, and as Tascan clarified during that recent event, Netflix will be doubling down on this strategy as it develops party games and establishes itself as a hub for kids and gamer families.
“I am very vigorous about lowering friction and eliminating it if we can,” he told The Game Business. “I see that the subscription is friction as well. Maybe good friction because it makes business sense, but still we did the test of eliminating subscription for [mobile game] Squid Game: Unleashed. And we may do other tests.”
He continued: “But the other friction is having enough controllers for family. Having a piece of hardware that might be expensive, that’s another friction. Waiting for a game to download, that’s another friction. I am [looking at] all the obstacles, and asking if we can reduce them as much as possible.”
Netflix said in early 2024 that games engagement had tripled throughout 2023, signaling that it would continue investing in the space in the future after a 2021CNBCreport suggestedless than 1% of subscribers were tapping into its gamesofferings. In October 2024, the streaming giant cut back on its gaming ambitions when itshut down its AAA studio headed by former Overwatch, Halo, and God of War developers. AGame Developerreport from last month said cuts had also recently hit Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, a teamNetflix picked up in 2021.
As Netflix seeks to tap into a market that it expects to be uninterested in game consoles, there’s little reason to doubt we’ll see something like aPlayStation 6ornext Xboxfrom Sony and Microsoft, respectively. Nintendo, meanwhile, is teetering on the edge of a brand-new console generation with itshighly anticipated Switch 2 device. It will pull back the curtain on its new tech with a focused Direct presentation next week, with many fans expecting to hear more aboutwhat features the Switch 2 brings to the table, its release date, andhow pre-orders are being handled.

"During today's Nintendo Direct, we saw some new gameplay for Pokemon Legends: Z-A, which showed off more footage of wild Pokemon, including wild Pokemon hanging out on rooftops, and a mysterious nighttime tournament called the Z-A Royale.

In the trailer, we learned that wild Pokemon don't just appear within designated zones in the city, but can also appear outside of them, including on rooftops. So you may encounter wild Pokemon that you can capture or battle when you're just wandering around Lumiose City.
More importantly, we learned a bit more about the cryptic tease at the end of the last Z-A trailer. At night, Lumiose City's streets are flooded with trainers battling in a tournament called the ""Z-A Royale"". You begin in the tournament at rank Z, and work your way up to rank A, with the promise of having a ""wish granted"" if you succeed.
With this feature, we got a look at more trainer battles, including the ability to ""surprise attack"" other trainers from behind to get an advantage in battle.
Pokemon Legends: Z-A was first announced atlast year's Pokemon Presents, with a cinematic trailer showing off a futuristicLumiose City. At the time, we were given very few details: just that it would be coming to Nintendo Switch this year, and some light Pokemon teases. We have sincegotten a longer look at the gamein a Pokemon Direct earlier this year, including seeing many of the Pokemon that will be available, a number of new characters, and the protagonist running all over the rooftops.
Since then, fans have been piecing together little hints from the trailer and their own experiences withPokemon Legends: Arceusand its unique spin on the Pokemon formula. While we can expect Legends: Z-A to have some similarities with Arceus, we're hoping it's a little more polished than both it and Scarlet and Violet when it launches later this year.

"Finding a good deal on Apple products is rough, which is why I focused on all of these daily deals today. Finding multiple Apple deals, plus discounts on Zelda and Final Fantasy collectibles? It's my gamer-tech jackpot. Right now, you can save onAirPods Pro 2, grab aMagSafe leather case for just $11.99, and even score afour-pack of AirTags for under $70.

If you’re in the market forwireless earbuds,power adapters, or anApple Watchband, there are plenty of options at all-time low prices. And you know by now I like to pop in some really cool gaming stuff. How about a full-sizedMaster Sword replicathat plays Zelda music when you swing it and aFinal Fantasy I-VI bundlethat brings the pixel-perfect RPG classics back to life?
Upgrade your tech, complete your Zelda shrine, or relive Final Fantasy’s golden era, these deals are worth checking out. Some discounts like the iPhone 14 Plus MagSafe case, are downright ridiculous at 80% off. But Apple deals never last long (Tim Cook loves that Apple tax), and limited collectibles definitely sell out fast. If something catches your eye, now’s the time to add to cart before the price jumps back up.
AliExpress is offering this Arzopa 15"" 1080p USB Type-C portable monitor for only $57 shipped after you apply coupon code ""IFPQHLH"". We've posted deals on this portable monitor in the past, but this is the lowest price we've seen thus far. The marketplace vendor is Arzopa itself so you're getting the full manufacturer's warranty on this brand new, retail packaged item. This monitor is primarily designed to be a secondary display for a laptop, but the S1's 1080p 60Hz panel is a great match for the Nintendo Switch's hardware, since the Switch only supports up to 720p @ 60Hz anyway.
For only $22 more, you can upgrade to the higher end Arzopa Z1FC USB portable monitor, now only $79.19 after coupon code ""IFPQHLH"". It's currently $117 on Amazon. The Z1FC's upgrades include a larger display (16.1"" vs 15.6""), a higher refresh rate (144Hz vs. 60Hz), and better color reproduction (100% sRGB color gamut). This is a better monitor than the S1 to pair with the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally because both gaming handhelds can support refresh rates up to 144Hz.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.

If you’ve ever dreamed of wielding the Master Sword, this Tamashii Nations replica brings that dream to life. At 41.3 inches, it’s a full-sized, collector-worthy version of Link’s legendary blade. It’s not just for display either thanks to authentic sound effects and vibrations activate when you grip and swing it, making you feel like the true Hero of Hyrule.
The hilt features three buttons that play eight iconic songs from Zelda’s history, including themes from Ocarina of Time, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom. The sword comes with a sheath and display stand, so whether you want to show it off or take it into battle (against your furniture), it’s ready. At $200, this highly allocated collectible is bound to sell out fast.
A genuine Apple leather case for $11.99? That’s not a typo. It’s an 80% discount. Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.

At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.

Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says ""powerful Pokémon"" like an angry robot penguin).
I'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.
If somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.
Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).

With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.

It retails for $199 new, so that's a substantial 20% in savings. A Sony warranty may or may not be included, but Amazon Resale items benefit from the same 30-day return policy you get for buying a new item. We expect this item to sell out pretty quickly.
Lenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart.

Amazon is offering a 6-foot INIU USB Type-A to USB Type-C cable for only $2.99 when you apply promo code ""C2ALZ6LN"" during checkout.

If you're thinking of jumping on the AMD bandwagon for your next upgrade, now is certainly the right time to do so.

Collectively, these processors represent the best gaming chips across both Intel and AMD.

Thenew iPad Airsits in the middle of Apple’s tablet lineup, with better specs than the baseline iPad, but it’s not as powerful as the iPad Pro. That said, if you need more computing power in a tablet than what the baseline device above offers, the new iPad Air with M3 chip will likely suit you just fine.

"And we don’t want to think about the Donkey Kong timeline
byMichael McWhertor
Donkey Kong Bananzamay have intriguing implications for the Donkey Kong timeline, based on a leak for the ape’s upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game. A piece ofartwork apparently leaked by Nintendo of Korea, and then spotted bya poster on Resetera, indicates that another well-known Donkey Kong character heretofore unannounced for the game may appear inBananza.
And her appearance could imply thatDonkey Kong Bananzais a prequel toSuper Mario Odysseyand perhaps even the originalDonkey Kong.
Or maybe not! Because what evenisthe Donkey Kong timeline? But let’s dig in… and wade into potential spoiler territory.
While official artwork and box art forDonkey Kong Bananza— seen above — shows DK being joined by a purple crystal blob known as “the Odd Rock,” nearly identical artwork for the game posted (and later pulled) by Nintendo of Korea shows what appears to be young Pauline adventuring with Donkey Kong. That version of Pauline wears a bracelet that matches the material and color of the Odd Rock.
So, what’s up with that?
Pauline is, of course, a character from the originalDonkey Kong, and the woman that Mario is tasked with rescuing from DK’s clutches in the 1981 arcade original. Pauline later appeared in Nintendo’s Mario vs. Donkey Kong games and was prominently featured in 2017’sSuper Mario Odysseyas the mayor of New Donk City. Pauline has been represented as an adult human woman in all of her Nintendo game appearances.
The Pauline seen in leaked artwork ofDonkey Kong Bananza, however, has childlike proportions. If she’s a child inBananza, that would mean the Switch 2 game is set before the events of the originalDonkey Kong. That, however, makes no sense, given that Donkey Kong encounters Cranky Kong inBananzain his aged, bearded form, and Cranky is — as established by Rare’sDonkey Kong Country— the original Kong that appeared inDonkey Kong. Cranky even references his early battles with Marioin dialogue fromBananza.
However, Nintendo has contradicted itself many times over regarding the relationship between Donkey Kong and Cranky Kong, and which of the two characters was the Donkey Kong that appeared in original arcade game. Suffice it to say, Nintendo’s Donkey Kong lore is a mess.
So there is a chance thatBananzais aDonkey Kongprequel, and that it establishes an early relationship between Pauline and her primate kidnapper. There’s also a strong chance that Pauline is also Odd Rock, made that way as part of a curse inflicted byBananzaantagonists VoidCo. Odd Rock is convinced to join Donkey Kong on his adventure inBananzathrough the power of music, and Pauline is famously an accomplished musician.
There’s also a chance that whatever magic VoidCo used to transform Pauline into a tiny purple rock also made her a child. That would still be weird.
But the Donkey Kong timeline, and the general Super Mario timeline, isextremelyweird. It was established in 2005’sMario & Luigi: Partners in Timethat Mario and Luigi have time traveled to the past and even interacted with infant versions of themselves. In the current Mario Kart canon, Mario and Luigi coexist with Baby Mario and Baby Luigi, indicating that the Mushroom Kingdom and adjacent kingdoms exist within some sort of time paradox. Baby versions of princesses Peach, Daisy, and Rosalina also exist alongside their adult counterparts, so maybe Baby Pauline does too…?
Maybe that’s not Pauline at all in theBananzaartwork. Maybe it’s a young relative who has adopted adult Pauline’s style of dress and makeup. This possibility almost seems the most logical, if Nintendo’s goal is to further confuse the Donkey Kong timeline.
The most important thing to take away from this thought exercise, however, is that the Donkey Kong timeline does not matter. Nintendo should not attempt toexplain it, devotea website to it, nor try to fit future Donkey Kong games into some sort of logical sequence.
Nintendo likely will explain Pauline’s role inDonkey Kong Bananzacloser tothe game’s launch in July. I think the best thing for the company to do at that stage is signal that Cranky Kong is actually Donkey Kong’s son, or that they’re baby and adult versions of the same ape, throwing the entire franchise into temporal chaos.

"See photos of Super Nintendo World, the How to Train Your Dragon rides, a new Harry Potter land, and much more
byJustin Brown
We’re less than two months away from the grand opening ofEpic Universe, the brand-new park at the Universal Orlando Resort. Originally announced in 2019, the park, which joins the existing Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure, and Volcano Bay and is estimated to have cost over$7 billion, has been highly anticipated by theme park nerds like myself. And, as it turns out, the name is incredibly fitting. During a media preview of the park, I experienced the new attractions, and the sights were truly epic.
Epic Universe is constructed as a series of hubs, connected by Celestial Park, a fantastical nexus. Branching off are the Isle of Berk from How to Train Your Dragon, a magical version of 1920s Paris inspired by Harry Potter, a horror-filled Darkmoor Village inspired by the Universal Monsters, and the world’s largest iteration of the now-infamous Super Nintendo World. Each world is accessed through a portal, all of which have unique special effects that transport travelers from Celestial Park to a completely new realm.
Here’s a peek at some of the standout experiences from each world (click to expand images):
The day started at The Chronos, the park’s imposing front gate that leads to Celestial Park, the central hub of Epic Universe. The area is a calming, lush landscape of gardens and fountains that acts as a nice palate cleanser when moving between the park’s four other elaborately themed worlds.
The marquee attraction of this area is Stardust Racers, a pair of intense dueling roller coasters that act as a spiritual successor to Islands of Adventure’s old Dueling Dragons coasters.
The two sides of Stardust Racers are color coded, yellow and green, and have unique layouts that flip, dive, and dodge one another endlessly.
As someone who can’t get enough of Islands of Adventure’s VelociCoaster, I personally enjoyed Stardust Racers even more.
The Isle of Berk is the park’s largest area and may be the most elaborately themed, all the way down to its unique benches carved like dragons and lampposts lit by piles of smoldering tinder.
Hiccup’s Wing Gliders, a family coaster that launches riders at a smooth 45 mph, gives the area a kinetic energy as it twists and turns throughout.
There’s also Fyre Drill, a wet and wild battle through the area’s lagoon where you’re absolutely guaranteed to get wet.
Elsewhere in Epic Universe’s Berk is The Untrainable Dragon, a stage show where Hiccup and Toothless fly over the crowd in their attempt to save Berk once more. It reminded me of a Broadway-style musical crammed into a tight 20-minute run time, complete with live Viking drummers, impeccable vocalists, and imposing, life-size dragons controlled by hidden puppeteers. Puppetry is all over the land, which is filled with character actors and large-size dragons with a similar vibe to Disney’s Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge.
My favorite ride in the land was the high-flying Dragon Racer’s Rally, where the intensity of the ride is completely up to each individual rider. Each vehicle sits a single person and can tip side to side freely, even rotating upside down. It’s completely up to you if you’d like a relaxing flight through the sky or a wild ride of endless barrel rolls. (And rest assured, tipping yourself upside down isnoteasy — I tried my hardest and only managed to do it once!)
Upon stepping through the Harry Potter-themed portal, I was transported to 1920s Paris with magical moments lurking behind every corner. In this world, inspired by the Fantastic Beasts and core Harry Potter films, visitors can browse a brand-new wand shop, eat at one of several magical eateries, and even catch a show at Le Cirque Arcanus, a magical circus that slowly devolves into a battle between its ringmaster and Newt Scamander’s beasts.
The centerpiece attraction of Epic Universe’s new Wizarding World is Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry, hiding in an entrance to the Parisian Metro.
Getting to the ride is an experience in and of itself. After traveling through the magical Metrofloo system in a burst of green flames, I walked my way through a jaw-dropping, four-story atrium with views into various offices throughout the ministry.
After passing by several rooms of talking portraits and hearing a warning from Umbridge’s elf Higgledy, I was led onto the ride vehicle: a 14-seat elevator that resembles Disney’s Tower of Terror.
The difference here is that this elevator does not drop, it moves sideways. The ride utilizes special effects to simulate a magical elevator ride caught in the middle of a battle to capture Umbridge and bring her to justice. No pics from inside just yet, as Universal is trying to keep a few surprises for the public.
Dark Universe is a smoldering, brooding world tucked away in the back of the park. After passing through the foreboding portal, I entered Darkmoor Village, a gothic land where monsters roam the streets. Immediately upon entering I had a close call with the Invisible Man, wrapped in his bandages, as he slowly stalked innocent bystanders throughout the area.
As I entered deeper into Darkmoor, I encountered the Burning Blade Tavern, an eatery tucked beneath a windmill that is ceremoniously set ablaze once every 20 minutes.
Weaving throughout the world is Curse of the Werewolf, a mid-size spinning roller coaster that launches you both forward and backward.
The main attraction here is Monsters Unchained: The Frankenstein Experiment, where the great-great-granddaughter of Dr. Frankenstein attempts to trap Dracula in the catacombs beneath the imposing castle. The ride is absolutely spectacular, utilizing the same robotic-arm ride system as Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey but with next-level special effects.
And while the ride (and park on the whole) is filled with monsters galore, including Frankenstein’s monster, Swamp Thing, and the Wolf Man, this is no haunted house. Rest assured, for the horror-averse travelers like myself, there are absolutely zero jump scares throughout the ride. Rather than trying to scare riders out of their seats, Dark Universe focuses on wowing riders with a truly immersive experience.
Epic Universe’s Super Nintendo World is a near replica of the one in Universal Studios Japan (versus the smaller version in Universal Studios Hollywood). After entering the warp pipe, I was immediately transported to a highly saturated landscape of coins, question blocks, Koopas, Goombas, and mushrooms as far as the eye can see.
I walked through Peach’s castle and witnessed magical warping portraits, rode on a Yoshi for an adventure to find the golden egg, and used special power-up bands (sold separately) to play mini challenges scattered across the world.
The third iteration ofMario Kart: Bowser’s Challengetruly cements Mario Kart as the ultimate “shoot-’em-up”’ ride across Universal’s theme parks. Thanks to the AR headsets that allow you to pick up item boxes and shoot enemies, it really does feel like you’re living in a video game rather than simply riding a ride that simulates one. By gamifying the experience, Bowser’s Challenge is kind of like the bigger quarter-eating arcade cabinet ever, complete with a leaderboard that makes you want to play (or should I say ride) over and over again until you hit a high score.
Super Nintendo World is the only realm with a portal-within-a-portal, transporting travelers from the Mushroom Kingdom to Donkey Kong Country. This area boasts a breathtaking series of waterfalls that cascade from the golden statue’s mouth. (The Japanese version has no waterfalls; instead, the golden statue exhales a much less impressive wisp of fog.)
While DK’s Mine-Cart Madness is easily one of the most anticipated rides in the park, it’s honestly as thrilling to watch as it is to ride. The ride vehicle is attached to an arm that extends far above the coaster’s real track, allowing ride designers to utilize fake tracks to simulate Donkey Kong Country’s infamous mine cart level.
By the end of my day, I felt like I had just scratched the surface of all that Epic Universe has to offer. While rushing from ride to ride, I passed by countless costumed characters that were imploring me to slow down and interact with them, which I was desperate to do — every inch of the park is so carefully constructed and meticulously themed, you just want to stop and stare at the edges.
I love theme parks and roller coasters, and I left Epic Universe with plenty of deeper impressions. Check back soon for more.

"‘We have indeed made it so that if it enters your mouth, you’ll spit it out’
byNicole Carpenter
Nintendouses a bitterant called denatonium benzoate applied to its Nintendo Switch cartridgesto dissuade people from putting cartridges in their mouths. It’s a substance that tastes absolutely foul, often used in similar situations — to keep people from consuming things they shouldn’t be, like antifreeze. While a Nintendo Switch cartridge might not be poisonous, you could choke on it. Children, especially, are at risk; they put all sorts of things in their mouths.
A Nintendo spokesperson confirmed to Polygon in 2017 that it uses this non-toxic coating to “to avoid the possibility of accidental ingestion.”
With the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement, it’s natural to wonder,What does a Nintendo Switch 2 cartridge taste like?Probably quite the same.Nintendo technical director Takuhiro Dohtadidn’t confirm that it’s denatoium benzoate, but he did say that it’s designed so that if you put it in your mouth you’ll spit it out. He advised not to try tasting it in an interview with GameSpot.
“We don’t want anybody to be at risk of any unwanted consumption,” Dohta said. “We have indeed made it so that if it enters your mouth, you’ll spit it out.”
Nintendo wasn’t offering taste samples of Switch 2 cartridgesduring Nintendo’s console preview event, and it’s unclear yet ifanyonehas tasted the cartridge. We’ll all likely have to wait until the console is released on June 5 to consider for our selves if we want to find out by putting one of the$80 cartridgesin our own mouths. It sounds like Dohta hasn’t — and won’t — be salivating at the chance to lickMario Kart World, though: “When the Nintendo Switch was being developed, I did lick it once, but never again. I can’t believe that other people are trying that.”

"A sort of middle-ground between physical and digital games
byIan Walker
Good news:Switch 2game-key cards won’t be locked to the first account or console that uses them.
“[Game-key cards] will start up on the console or system that it is slotted into, so it’s not tied to an account or anything,” Tetsuya Sasaki, general manager of Nintendo’s technology development division,told GameSpot.
Unlike regular game cartridges,game-key cardssimply allow access to a digital download of the game in question when inserted into the Switch 2.
“Game-key cards are different from regular game cards, because they don’t contain the full game data,”Nintendo’s support page explains. “Instead, the game-key card is your ‘key’ to downloading the full game to your system via the internet. After it’s downloaded, you can play the game by inserting the game-key card into your system and starting it up like a standard physical game card.”
Nintendo has yet to say which games will be released on game-key cards and why, but common speculation considers the format as a way to distribute games that have grown too big for the Switch 2’s 64 GB cartridges while appeasing those who continue to push back against an all-digital future. Unfortunately, there’s no indication game-key cards will be any cheaper than regular physical cartridges — you may have heard, butMario Kart Worldwill cost a whopping $80, and that was beforeTrump’s tariffsannouncement — and an internet connection will be necessary for the initial download.
Switch 2 launches worldwide on June 5.

"We spoke with Nintendo’s Bill Trinen to get to the bottom of the Switch 2’s price point
byRuss Frushtick
Last week, Nintendo revealed a ton of information about theSwitch 2. And while there were some surprises — like abizarrely destructive Donkey Kong game— the real shock was that of the sticker variety. The prices of both theSwitch 2 console ($449.99)and its games (as much as$79.99 forMario Kart World) indicated that Nintendo’s next generation would not come cheaply.
To get a better understanding of why there has been such a dramatic increase in price over the previous generation, we spoke with Bill Trinen, vice president of player & product experience at Nintendo.
[Ed. note:This interview was conducted on April 3, the day before Nintendo announced it woulddelay Switch 2 pre-ordersin the U.S. due to uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s sweeping new tariffs.]
To start off with, I asked Trinen what exactly was driving the price up on the console itself (coming in at $150 more than the original Switch).
“Well, I would say there’s a couple of things,” said Trinen. “Number one, we’re unfortunately living in an era where I think inflation is affecting everything. And it’s affecting everything from day-to-day prices, it’s affecting technology and things of that nature. I think we’re also seeing smart devices now… I wish they were not nearly as expensive as they are. They’re certainly a lot more expensive than they were when they originally came out in the mid-2000s. So as you add more technology into a system, especially in this day and age, that drives additional cost.”
Trinen went on to explain that the Switch 2’s upgrades, like the redesigned Joy-Cons withmouse controlsandsystem-wide chat, add more value (and therefore more cost) to the overall package.
But if it’s simply the internals that are driving the console’s price up, it did make me wonder why there’s such a huge variance between the Japanese-language Switch 2 (which will cost 49,980 yen, or approximately $343) and the Switch 2 that supports all languages, whose price is more than $100 higher than that in some regions.
“An average consumer may not be fully aware of the varying market differences between the different territories,” Trinen explained. “So globally, Nintendo takes an approach of looking at: What are the market circumstances in different territories, how are things impacting those market circumstances, and what options do we have to try to appropriately price the product based on the local market circumstances? And I think that’s an example of one where because of some unique circumstances in the Japanese market, [Nintendo has] tried to find a way to essentially create an opportunity that satisfies that market, but without having broader impacts.”
Trinen didn’t specifically address recent global trade issues, driven by President Donald Trump’s trade war with practically every nation on Earth, but it was clear that these undercurrents of uncertainty had an impact on the Switch 2’s pricing. Nintendo actually moved itsSwitch production to Vietnam back in 2019in an effort to avoid the heavy tariffs placed on China during the first Trump administration. Unfortunately for Nintendo, on the day of the big debut of the Switch 2,Trump instituted a 46% tariff on Vietnam. The high price for the Switch 2 might have been the result of some educated guesswork from Nintendo to allow the company to better weather the market conditions that the trade wars might bring. Clearly, that guesswork is ongoing, as pre-orders have been delayed due to the incoming tariffs.
Outside of hardware manufacturing, Nintendo fans have also been concerned about rising software prices. Since the days of the Wii U, Nintendo has stuck to the $59.99 price point for just about every game. That continued for more than 10 years untilThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdomarrived in 2023 at a$69.99 price point. And now, just two years after that, we’re seeingMario Kart Worldhit $79.99.
I asked Trinen to explain the rising cost of games, and what’s driving it for Nintendo.
“The price of video games has been very stable for a very long time,” said Trinen. “I actually have an ad on my phone that I found from 1993, whenDonkey Kong Countryreleased on the SNES at $59. That’s a very, very long time where pricing on games has been very stable. And so obviously, it would be great if we didn’t live in an era when everything is getting more expensive, so there’s that reality of it.”
Trinen went on to say that Nintendo does look at each title individually when determining pricing, and that its decision-making is based on a variety of factors.
“We take an approach of looking at: What is the experience, and what are players going to enjoy out of this game? What is the length of the game — what’s the volume of the experience? How in-depth is it? And then we price appropriately based on what we think the value of that experience is,” said Trinen. “And so a good example would be something likeTears of the Kingdomon Nintendo Switch. We did price that at a higher price point. That didn’t mean all of a sudden that every game on Nintendo Switch was all of a sudden priced at that higher price.
“And so similarly, with something likeMario Kart[World], with something likeDonkey Kong Bananza, we’re really looking at the experience and saying, ‘OK, this we feel is an appropriate price,’ taking into [account] a lot of these other factors that are just impacting pricing overall in this day and age.”
While it’s clear that there are business reasons for these price increases across the board, it’s unlikely that those explanations will entirely satisfy fans looking to experience the next generation of Nintendo games on a budget. Now it’s just a question of whether those fans are willing to gobble up copies ofMario Kart Worldat the same astonishing pace as they did withMario Kart 8 Deluxeon the Switch. A slow start might be the only thing that could stop the $79.99 price point in its tracks for the rest of this generation.

"The dedicated GameChat button will require a recurring fee
byTyler Colp
Nintendo has made its own Discord-like chat app for theSwitch 2, and it’s going to charge you for it. Once the free period is over on March 31, 2026,GameChat, and the C button that activates it, will require a Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) membership.
So what happens if you aren’t a subscriber and press the C button? Not much, vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen told Polygon in a recent interview.
“You would be able to find out about the NSO subscription there and get a sense of some of the functionality,” he said.
Presumably, this is how you’d learn that GameChat works a lot like Discord video chat works on PC. You can talk with your friends in handheld or docked mode via a built-in microphone and stream your gameplay to each other. There’s even acamera you can buyto overlay onto your stream, or just to chat face-to-face.
But unless you have an active NSO membership, you’ll have a whole button dedicated to nothing on your Switch 2. It doesn’t even sound like you can remap it to something else. It will just be a reminder of the annual $19.99 fee you may or may not be handing to Nintendo every year (or $49.99 for the Expansion Pack).
Trinen says the C button has a price tag because GameChat is “part of the overall platform experience” and that “NSO really is a critical piece of the Nintendo Switch 2 experience.” He listed off some of the new Switch 2-exclusive benefits, likeaccess to old GameCube gamesand free upgrades toThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom.
That subscription fee will be on top of a console that’s already going to cost you $449.99 — or possibly more ifU.S. President’s Trump’s tariffsprompt Nintendo to increase it. We won’t know if GameChat will prove to be worth it until theSwitch 2 releases in June.
Correction (April 8):A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the frequency of Nintendo Switch Online’s fees. It has been updated to reflect NSO’s annual subscription fees.

"Doot doot doot doot doot do do

There is something perfectly simple and catchy about the Wii eShop’s theme song. It’s been remixed and parodied, even becoming the perfect sketch fodder forNirvana the Band the Show. You’re probably already humming it right now.
While that music was so iconic, there is a surprisingly practical reason that later system shops, like the Nintendo Switch, didn’t feature a theme song. That trend will continue on Switch 2.
“Unlike back then, the eShop now has lots of videos that are showcasing the games,” Nintendo Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto said. “We didn’t want to intrude on that, so we don’t have music there.”
I asked this in an interview that took place after these same Switch 2 hardware developers did a longer press conference with a large group of press in New York on Wednesday. During that interview, another Switch 2 developer, Takuhiro Dohta, said Kawamoto had “strong feelings” about the eShop. Kawamoto followed up that he “probably booted the Wii Shopping Channel the most out of any application [on the Wii].”
Kawamoto did tell me the Wii Shopping Channel music still gets stuck in his head, which of course it does.
As for actual improvements to this quiet Switch 2 eShop, Kawamoto said on Wednesday his focus was performance.
“I wanted to make sure that it was a smooth experience. That the scrolling of the list doesn’t stall, that it’s very smooth, pages load fast,” he told the room in New York.
We’ll see more of the Switch 2’s eShop when the console launches June 5.

"Whew, thank goodness
byJulia Lee
Good news! If you’ve been fretting about abandoning yourAnimal Crossing: New Horizonsisland save on a console that will rot away in storage, then worry not. You’ll be able to seamlessly transfer your island save data to the Nintendo Switch 2, without needing to download an extra app or use a cloud save.
The Nintendo Switch 2 will have the option to do a complete system transfer from your original Switch, moving overeverythingin one process — including your beloved island. Nintendo confirmed this during an interview with Polygon last week.
“So I should clarify that when you do the system transfer, everything like save data will remain on the Nintendo Switch and once it moves to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well,” Programming Management Group Senior Director Takuhiro Dohta said. “But the [Animal Crossing] island will be an actual move. So it will leave Nintendo Switch and move over to Nintendo Switch 2.”
Before, there were technically two ways to move your island. You could save it to the cloud and then download it back (though this was more so for if you lose or broke your Switch) or you would need todownload the “Animal Crossing: New Horizons Island Transfer Tool” appon your Switch to transfer it from one console to the other. The former cloud method would also require you tocontact Nintendo to download the data, so. Not great.
While neither of these methods were horrendous, they just seemed a little convoluted to move save data. It’s kind of understandably so, as Nintendo doesn’t want you to have clones of your island across multiple devices and whatnot, but still! It’s nice to know that you won’t have to deal with any extra frills when it comes to keeping your island safe. While many of us (myself included) haven’t touchedNew Horizonsin years, it’d be sad to lose all the hard work we put in.
That being said, you’ll need both your original Nintendo Switch and your Nintendo Switch 2 on hand to do this transfer, so if you’retrading your Switchto get a cheaper Switch 2, you’ll still need to use the cloud back-up, it seems. ☹

"Console heft is a personal preference, but worth some thought
byChelsea Stark
Reporting assistance from Samit Sarkar
After spending some time with Nintendo’sSwitch 2last week during its hands-on event in New York, I’m a little worried about its weight. Specifically, I’m worried it’s going to be less comfortable for me to hold the console in handheld mode for long periods of time like I have comfortably done with the original Switch and the Switch OLED.
The problem with these hands-on events is I’m never playing one game for long. Only one game,Mario Kart World, was set up to work in handheld mode during play, and I was able to play three or so races before my demo time ended. (The rest of the game experiences used the Pro Controller, Joy-Con, orJoy-Con in mouse mode.) The Switch 2 was also sturdily tethered to the table, with a secure bracket on its back, adding to the weight. But still, I could definitely feel the difference.Are my arms getting tired?Are they MORE tired than normal?I’m also standing, of course, and not playing while sitting — or lying on my couch, the perfect way to wile away a weekend.
After the hands-on event, I spent time looking at the spec sheets for the Switch 2, the Switch OLED, the original Switch, and the Steam Deck to figure out exactly how much more weight I was feeling. The Switch 2, with Joy-Con 2 attached, is 534 grams (or 1.18 lbs). My current preferred handheld, the Switch OLED, is 420 grams (or 14.82 oz, a little less than a pound). And the Steam Deck, which I own but kind of loathe using because I feel like it’s too heavy, is 669 grams (or 1.47 pounds).
This kind of console weight preference feels very personal, and sometimes gendered. I also am nearsighted and hold my handhelds closer to my face than many people, thus possibly increasing my arm strain. But the Switch 2 is also a device that is targeted at children, especially with launch titles like the crowd-pleasing Mario Kart franchise, so weight is probably a factor for lots of people thinking about playing one for a while.
Looking at the percentage change, the Switch 2 is 27% heavier than a Switch OLED, and only 20% lighter than a Steam Deck. That’s not nothing! I’m concerned the Switch 2 might not be as ideal for me because of that increase.
If you’re curious about the weight change, here’s a table:
There’s of course lots else to consider too. The Switch 2 is running a faster CPU and has a bigger, brighter LCD screen. There are obviously reasons it’s going to be this heavy. And while I am excited about the increased frame rate and variable refresh rate, I also want to be able t hold the dang thing for more than 45 minutes.
I asked the Switch 2 hardware developers about the console weight, and how they balance making the console everyone can play and getting in the all the technical features they want.
“We make it. We pick it up. We try it, and we make it again,” said Takuhiro Dohta, senior director for Nintendo’s Program Management Group. “There’s a lot of rinse and repeat of that. During that [process], there are then discussions and elements of the hardware, like, ‘We want a bigger screen, so this is the size we want to go with.’ or considering the feel of the controller, ‘This is how we want the controller to feel.’
“These are elements of the hardware that we have to maintain and it’s within those parameters that we start to make fine-tuned adjustments.”
After that, they rely on the staff of Nintendo to weigh in.
“At Nintendo, there are all different types of people: people who are big and strong, people who are maybe smaller and not as strong,” Dohta continued. “And so we then take that around [the] company and have them hold it and give us their feedback. And that’s how we kind of adjust.”
Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto added that once the team has settled on the size and general weight, they have lots of options to fine-tune the process, because “the lighter, the better.”
“We take different stabs at the stand shape or the shape of the console. And on the console we have different use of plastic and metal. So it’s balancing all these different factors and wants, and then balancing capabilities and performance,” Kawamoto said.
It probably won’t be clear if I find the Switch 2 comfortable enough to use until I get to spend some actual time with it in a natural setting: without a weighted tether, stretched out on a couch. But for something that could cost quite a bit, it’s worth thinking about before launch — or lifting some weights, I guess.

"What was that about keeping politics out of games?
byZoë Hannah
Nintendo’s Switch 2 ramp-up week started with a cheerful bang (a jingle, really) at Wednesday’sSwitch 2 Directthat revealed the sleeknew console’s release date,launch games, and features.Donkey Kong hype aboundedonline, at least until the company’s news releases started trickling out to outlets like Polygon, and sticker shock took over.Nintendo announced it would charge $450 for its consoleand$80 for its flagship game,Mario Kart World(or $500 for the two bundled together).
Around the same time, President Trump announced hissweeping global trade plan, which included significant tariffs for virtually every country in the world — includinguninhabited regions. To put it simply, everyone began freaking the fuck out in response, andthe stock marketdid, too. In the news and on social media, both “Switch 2” and “Trump tariffs” began trending, marking the beginning of a very chaotic 48 hours in which the release of a highly anticipated game console and the blundering whims of the U.S. president became inextricably linked not just for the folks who care about games, but for consumers of other mainstream media, too.
The tariffs will impact the cost of almost everything Americans purchase, all amidst stocks plummeting downward andsocial servicesgetting dismantled. That might include the cost of Switch 2 — a price that a lot of people weren’t happy about beforeNintendo announced it would delay pre-ordersdue to “tariffs and evolving market conditions.” Panic has ensued for fans:What if the Switch 2 is even more expensive than $450?That’s on top of this other bit of lurking dread:What if there aren’t enough Switch 2s to go around?
Business professor and author Joost van Dreunen said in an email to Polygon that Nintendo’s “explicit reference to tariffs” in its statement is highly unusual for the company, and for Japanese corporate posturing in general. “Japanese companies traditionally avoid commenting on foreign policy matters, making this directness particularly noteworthy. By specifically naming tariffs as the cause rather than using vaguer language about ‘supply chain challenges’ or ‘global market conditions,’ Nintendo is clearly signaling to shareholders and consumers that the delay stems from external policy decisions rather than internal planning failures.” (Polygon reached out to Nintendo for comment but did not hear back before press time.)
There have long been a vocal few in the gaming community who talk about “keeping politics out of games,” which is a senseless take devoid of critical thought to begin with. But that take has never been more senseless than it is right now: Trump’s trade war is, quite literally, impacting games. And Nintendo wants us to know it, too.
But it’s likely not because so many gamers’ favorite nostalgia manufacturer is taking a stand against the big bad along with us. It’s a strategic decision (though I wouldn’t be surprised if Nintendo’s execs privately despise Trump for this decision and maybe even others).
“It insulates Nintendo from criticism about their own execution while gently educating their consumer base about how trade policy directly impacts product availability and potentially pricing,” van Dreunen said. “The reference to ‘evolving market conditions’ gives them flexibility to make adjustments beyond just responding to tariffs, potentially including competitive positioning against the rumored PS5 Pro price drop or shifts in component availability.”
Trump’s newest round of tariffs include a hefty increase up to 46% for Vietnam, the location Nintendo moved much of its manufacturing to several years ago when Trump increased tariffs on China. But van Dreunen doesn’t think it’s too likely Nintendo will raise the price of Switch 2 so close to launch, which he says would be “unprecedented.”
“Nintendo needs time to assess whether their existing price point of $449.99 remains viable or if their projected margins have been compromised. The delay gives them flexibility to either secure additional inventory ahead of potential tariff implementation, explore manufacturing alternatives, or adjust their go-to-market strategy,” van Dreunen said. “More likely, Nintendo will maintain the announced price but potentially reduce initial production volume or adjust bundle offerings to preserve margins. They’re essentially buying time to make the most informed decision possible in a rapidly evolving trade environment.”
And while it’s tempting to take van Dreunen’s salient expertise here as a sign that it’s not all that bad, he also says the gaming industry tends to offer a decent pulse on the rest of the economy.
“Nintendo specifically makes an interesting barometer because their audience skews more mainstream and family-oriented than competitors, meaning their customer base includes the middle-income consumers most affected by economic headwinds,” van Dreunen said. “In this case, Nintendo’s response to these tariffs offers a preview of how global companies with complex supply chains will navigate increasing trade barriers – not by immediately passing costs to consumers, but by tactical delays and strategic reassessment. Their caution signals the broader uncertainty facing multinational companies as global trade tensions escalate.”
The only thing we know for sure is that a lot more uncertainty is coming our way.

"They compete closely on price and specs, but Nintendo still owns the mass market
byOli Welsh
When Nintendo launched the Switch in 2017, it had no competition in dedicated handheld gaming, a sector it had established with the Game Boy in 1989 and ruled ever since. Sega had come and gone; Sony, after two determined attempts with the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita, had just about given up.
As Switch 2 nears launch in 2025, things look a little different — but only a little. The colossal success of the Switch has awoken the slumbering giants. Sony and Microsoft are now reportedly preparingdedicated PlayStationandXbox handhelds. Improbably, though, it was the PC gaming sphere that made the first move. Valve led the way with the Steam Deck in 2022, which swiftly seeded a growing ecosystem of similar, PC-based handheld devices from manufacturers like Lenovo and Asus. After a quiet decade, non-Nintendo handheld gaming is a thing again. And that means the Switch 2 will not run unopposed for handheld gaming supremacy.
In a sense, Nintendo is the victim of its own strategic foresight. With the Switch, it was the first to spot that the narrowing gap in processing power between mobile and at-home devices had enabled a unification of handheld and home gaming experiences. Finally, the same games could work in both contexts. The Switch proved this point emphatically, and now everyone wants a piece.
But with dedicated devices from Sony and Microsoft still years away, for now that competition must come from Steam Deck and the other PC handhelds. My colleague Chris Plante persuasively argued that these devices representNintendo’s “biggest threat in the present.”They trounce the Switch on specs and have closed the gap to contemporary AAA gaming in the home until it’s almost imperceptible. Software-wise, they offer the compelling value and staggering range of just about everything on Steam — and much of PC gaming beyond it, if you’re prepared to fiddle about a bit.
It’s true that the Switch 2’s price and specs put it into direct competition with the lower-end PC handhelds. At $449, it’s $50 more expensive than the base model Steam Deck. The Switch 2 isroughly comparable in power and storage, has a much better screen, and with detachable controllers and a TV dock included in the price, it’s much more flexible to use. The base model of Asus’ ROG Ally handheld ($499 or thereabouts) and the new Lenovo Legion Go S ($549) are also pretty close competitors in terms of specs.
In raw hardware terms, these are all very similar devices. It’s worth noting that the Switch 2’sexclusive accesstoNvidia’s market-leading DLSS upscaling technologyshould allow it to punch a bit above its weight class. But realistically, there’s not much between them.
But — and it’s a very, very big but — comparing the Switch 2 to the PC handhelds by running your finger down a spec sheet, or by noting that they can all playCivilization 7andElden Ring, does not tell the whole story. Within an enthusiast bubble, PC handhelds are a big deal, but they do not exist in the same universe as Nintendo consoles. To put it bluntly, PC handhelds are still niche.
The Steam Deck has been a big success for Valve, but let’s put it in perspective. Valve has not discussed sales numbers, but market research estimates thatit has sold around 4 million Steam Decks. And Steam Deck dwarfs its competition; the same research suggests that, in total, around 6 million PC handhelds have been sold in the three years since the Steam Deck went on the market. Worryingly, there aren’t yet signs of strong growth in sales.
Stack that up against the Switch’s 150 million units sold and the wild difference in scale becomes evident. Of course, it isn’t a directly analogous comparison. PC handhelds have only existed for three years; the Switch has been around for eight years, and Nintendo has been in the handhelds business for more than 35 years. All the same, Nintendo predicts it will sell11 million units of the aging Switchin its current fiscal year — more than five times the predicted sales of PC handhelds in that time. Meanwhile, analysts reckon that theSwitch 2 will, on its own, outstrip the size of the PC handheld marketalmost immediately, with 6 to 8 million units available at launch, and up to 20 million sales in its first year.
Valve is a big player in the game industry, and a very rich company. But it is a newcomer to the world of consumer electronics retail, and it has a lot of catching up to do — if it’s even interested in doing it. Steam Deck isn’t available to purchase in stores; you can’t walk into Walmart and pick one up. Valve is not buying ads for it on TV or at bus stops. Companies like Lenovo and Asus have more traditional distribution channels, but they’re tiny minnows compared to the marketing, retail, and distribution might of Nintendo.
There are other factors that make the PC handhelds niche products. The user experience of Windows-based handhelds like the ROG Ally and Legion Go is notoriously bad. Valve’s SteamOS is much better, but it is still quite far removed from the reliability and simplicity offered by Nintendo and the other console platforms.
You cannot unbox a new Steam Deck, turn it on, and play a game straight away. It requires tinkering to get the best out of. Although Valve’s verification system for games is a helpful guide, it’s not guaranteed you’ll get a good, playable experience on every game. The Deck is also bulky and heavy. You would never buy one for a child, or share one within a family — it’s clearly not designed to be shared. Realistically, it remains a tough sell for anyone who isn’t a gaming hobbyist.
There is, reportedly, one upcoming device that may be able to change this narrative a little. Microsoft is said to be working with a PC handheld manufacturer ona system that will have Xbox brandingand a user interface based on a new version of the Xbox PC app. This has the potential to be a more user-friendly device that offers easy access to PC Game Pass on the go, which would be quite compelling. But, although Microsoft has now been making Xbox consoles for over 20 years, it hasconsistently struggledto use that experience to make PC gaming more seamless, despite repeated attempts — and the device doesn’t sound like much more than a stopgap until Microsoft’s own dedicated handheld console is ready.
Nintendo will not have true competition in handhelds until its peers in the console space get involved. Microsoft is reportedly eyeing 2027 for the release of its handheld Xbox. Sony’s portable PS5 is also said to be years away, if it’s ever released. Things are definitely heating up for Nintendo, and by the end (or even the middle) of the Switch 2’s life, the handheld gaming market is sure to be much busier than it is now. But for the next few years, competition for the new console will remain distant — at best.

"Am I enabling the Disney villains in their modern evil schemes? Maybe, maybe so
byPetrana Radulovic
I did something horrible. I told Jafar, the scheming vizier villain in Disney’sAladdin, about cryptocurrency, and now he’s determined to get WyshCoin off the ground by selling the luxurious lifestyle associated with the brand. The problem is he’s actually broke, so I need to brew him teleportation potion after teleportation potion so he can sneak into increasingly extravagant venues in order to sell the illusion of the WyshCoin lifestyle.
That’s just a day in the life of a potionista (a portmanteau of potion maker and barista) at the Cursed Café, the coffee shop at the center ofDisney Villains Cursed Café. The game is a partnership between Disney Studios and indie team Bloom Digital Media. InDisney Villains Cursed Café, I spend time brewing potions, talking to my villainous clientele and helping them achieve their goals (or sometimes, very specificallynothelping them). It’s a modern setting, which means the villains all have fun, contemporary designs — and contemporary problems.
Yes, Jafar’s setting up a cryptocurrency, and Snow White’s Evil Queen is running her own pyramid scheme. Meanwhile, Gaston is trying to impress his new golf bros at the country club he just joined. It’s hilarious to see what sorts of villainous shenanigans these iconic characters get up to in a modern, low-stakes setting. They’re taking over the world… in their own ways. And hey, in the year 2025, that does mean having huge social media followings!
The writing is sharp and funny, with some particularly pointed dialogue options (you can tell the villains that in this modern world, the rulers are the 1%, for instance). Seeing the characters interact is also a highlight. Cruella and the Evil Queen roll their eyes at Gaston’s attempts at dating on “the apps.” Maleficent and Ursula reluctantly team up for a social media collaboration. And throughout it all, the art style is incredibly charming, an elevated rendering of the characters’ Disney movie counterparts with some painterly accents.
With each in-game day, I have three chances to serve customers. Most of the time, this means picking between two villains to serve. But don’t worry — if it’s Cruella and Jafar at the counter and I pick Jafar, the rest of Cruella’s storyline will still unfold. The brewing mechanic is pretty straightforward; I just look at the recipe list to find the requested potion and then select the ingredients in my cupboards.
Occasionally, the villains will have bigger requests, and taking those on will continue the next big chapters of their plots. They’ll present me with their desired potion, often something malevolent and more complicated. My handy potion book will suggest a “good” option as well: It’ll have the same outcome, but probably result in less property damage. If you want to try a different option — or if you accidentally add the wrong ingredients — you’ll have the choice at the end of the day to buy a re-do from Yzma. The branching is simple, but enjoyable.
There is also an overarching mystery about the previous owner of the café that continues to perplex me — and is surprisingly complicated to figure out. One time, after I had messed up a day and intended to redo it, Yzma handed me a key that unlocked a secret room that held clues about this mysterious owner. But since I had fumbled the Evil Queen’s storyline, I erased the memories of that day to try again. The second time, though, I didn’t get the key — and a few in-game days later, I still haven’t! I’m not sure what conditions trigger more information about this storyline, but I’m determined to keep selling potions to find out.
But even if I’m still struggling at figuring out the grander mystery of the Cursed Café, I’m invested in the storylines of my customers. Even if I’m notactuallyinvesting in WyshCoin, every time I see Jafar at the counter, I eagerly select him to serve because I just want to know what the heck he’s scheming next. Maybe I’m tapping into my own inner villain by enabling him, but hey, you don’t become the favorite potion brewer of some of the best Disney villains by playing hero.

TheSwitch 2is a social machine. For the console’s second iteration, Nintendo prioritizedprocessing powercapable oflarge-scale multiplayer. TheJoy-Cons’ new C buttonlets you instantly join a group chat with shared-screen play options. Extensions in the Nintendo Switch Online app will add dimension to old titles, includingautobuild-sharing inThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. As producer Kouichi Kawamoto put it in Nintendo’s post-revealAsk the Developerupdate, development of the Switch 2 was inspired by memories of “playing games together as children at a friend’s house or in a student lounge, where everyone brought their own consoles.” The clear goal is to bring frictionless community play to Switch 2 that will be safe for all ages.
The pitch is harmonious on paper and, based on footage in theSwitch 2 Direct, existentially terrifying as a practice. Inspired by one of the defining experiences of the early 2020s, in which many of us were sequestered inside our homes playingAnimal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo has, intentionally or not, optimized Switch 2 for the next global shutdown.
Work on the Switch 2 began in earnest in 2019, according to Kawamoto, and the early focus was on improving software performance through tech upgrades. But development soon became entangled with the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdown protocols forced Nintendo’s teams, among millions and millions of others, to work from home. The frustrations the team experienced while making the setup work led to one of Switch 2’s major features: GameChat.
“Back then, we were using a video conferencing system to check the software we were developing with our team, but the screen-sharing function built into the video conferencing system only allowed us to share one gameplay screen at a time,” Kawamoto says in the Ask the Developer interview. “So, we had each person place their game screen in front of their camera instead of their faces. When we did that, it felt like we were all in the same place, each bringing our own console to play the game together, which was a lot of fun. Based on this experience, we proposed adding a feature to Switch 2 where people can share their gameplay screen with other players.”
As demonstrated in a video Nintendo released on Thursday, GameChat looks and feels exactly like a Discord or Zoom call. After receiving a notification for a GameChat invite from a friend, a player simply hits the C button to open a multi-window grid that allows for the seamless continuation of play while peeking in on whatever their friends are playing and chatting back and forth. The sizzle reel shows up to four people participating in a call, playing games individually or together in multiplayer spaces likeSplatoon 3andMario Party Jamboree. Players speak to each other using the onboard console mic and can activate video usingthe new Switch 2 camera accessory. If for some reason a Switch 2 player needed to remain in their house without making human contact for two to 12 months, Nintendo has them covered on the socializing front.
In many ways, Nintendo is beyond late to the game. Discord is right there, but even before the ubiquitous social platform, Microsoft strove for a similar connection when it launched Skype integration for the Xbox One in 2013, allowing for a party-chat-like experience. Nintendo’s dream of bringing distant friends closer together during remote play also predates GameChat; the Wii had the Wii Speak mic accessory and thefew people who bought a Wii Uhad the ability to ring friends with Wii U Chat. But GameChat stands to be the cleanest collision of social and play on a console yet, and one with greater protection for kids thanks to Nintendo’s walled-off friend-list gardens. In the Switch 2 era, no distance will keep friends apart.
It’s a far cry from the vision for the original Switch. Nintendo revealed that console ina vibrant 2016 teaserthat highlighted the hybrid console’s on-the-go possibilities. Players could kick back on the couch to play the new Zelda, or they could also traverse Hyruleliterally anywhere else— in airports, in parks, huddled around a beer hall picnic table with friends. Those memories of “playing games together as children” were part of the Switch DNA too, with an emphasis on breaking down the living room walls. With the Switch 2, Nintendo has retreated back indoors, and wants us to lean in closer to the TV.
Nintendo hasn’t abandoned the hybrid nature of the console and it never will, but GameChat’s Zoom aesthetic is a jarring departure from the limitlessness of the 2016 Switch reveal. In Nintendo’s promo video for Switch 2, good-looking 20-somethings chill in each of their loft apartments, remotely chit-chatting with each other as one playsZelda: Echoes of Wisdomand another explains the inner workings ofUntitled Goose Game. In another vignette, a Japanese woman tells her three friends about a pizza place they once visited together in the outside world, which she has recreated inAnimal Crossing: New Horizons, a game which has no negative connotations to our social reality whatsoever.
Read the news, and you know Nintendo is making a smart call. Ashas been widely reported over the last year, the outbreak potential of H5N1, dubbed “bird flu,” looms as the virus jumps from avian species to mammals. The fear at this present juncture is not just that H5N1 couldevolve to affect a wider spread of humansthan just poultry and dairy workerswho contract it on farms, but that combating bird flu is looking more and more like a potential U.S. infrastructure failure. Scientists say bird fluhas been under-addressed on a political levelover the last few years, while the Trump administration’s mission tocut jobs in the health sectormay impact the meager work that is being done. When asked recently what should be done about the continued emergence of bird flu, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s top health official, suggestedletting it run its course through bird populations, which scientists seem to agree is a pretty terrible way of mitigating viral mutation.
That’s a lot of doom to erupt out of the introduction of Nintendo’s GameChat function, but then again, who could forget the time when GameChat would make the most sense? During my quarantine days in 2020, I spent an ungodly number of evenings playingMario Kart 8 Deluxeonline with a few non-gamer friends who lived just a few blocks away. Like the majority of people, the easiest way for us all to catch up face to face and talk a bit of smack as we swerved around Rainbow Road was to load up the Switch on the TV and a Zoom call on a laptop. With Switch 2, we’ll have GameChat. In a way, I pray we never have to use it.
There are less apocalyptic reasons GameChat is a tremendous advancement. There are families spread out around the state, the country, the world, who will come together to playKirby Air Ridersand feel closer than they ever would over a quick FaceTime check-in. The FromSoftware fans will have a helluva time screaming at each other asthey embark on whateverThe Duskbloodsturns out to be. All of that will happen from the comfort of home — the same home, the same walls, the same sofa, the inescapable familiar.
The global population might completely avoid H5N1 or whatever the next close call looks like. Nintendo isn’t taking a chance. It has built a console for socializing in solitary confinement that, thankfully, still has a handheld mode. I’ll be taking it outside while I can.

"It’s unclear if the Switch 2 will utilize Hall-effect joysticks
byChelsea Stark
While Nintendo shared a lot about the hardware for theNintendo Switch 2during its April 2 Nintendo Direct and subsequent Treehouse streams, the company still won’t share the exact workings of the second iteration of Joy-Con or Pro Controller directional inputs. Specifically, fans have been wondering if the new analog sticks will useHall effect technology, which has been highly rumored and would help combat the drift issues that plagued the original Switch’s controllers.
As Polygon published this story,Nintendo Lifepublished confirmation from Nate Bihldorff, senior vice president of product development and publishing at Nintendo of America, that the Joy-Con 2 controllers do not contain Hall-effect sticks. Bihldorff wouldn’t say more, and there’s no word yet on theSwitch 2 Pro Controller’s sticks. Nintendo confirmed Bihldorff’s statement to Polygon later Monday.
Nintendo’s hardware developers, featured in the Nintendo Direct, were first asked this question during a large press briefing with over 100 outlets on Wednesday, April 2. A reporter from TechRadar asked if stick drift had been improved with the Joy-Con 2 and Pro Controller 2.
“As you may have witnessed and felt, the new Joy-Con 2 controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been really designed from the ground up from scratch and they’ve been designed to have bigger movements and also a smoother movement,” said Tetsuya Sasaki, general manager of Nintendo’s hardware development division, to the crowd via translator. He offered no additional follow-up, only asking the reporters assembled if they could feel the difference.
Polygon followed up in a translated interview with Nintendo’s hardware team the next day, asking if the Joy-Con would use magnets, which are a key component in Hall effect joysticks, so the sticks would have less wear and tear over time.
“It is true that we’ve rebuilt those as well from the ground up,” Sasaki reiterated. “We haven’t shared what the inner mechanisms are of those control sticks, and if I were to dive into it, it would basically be sharing the whole blueprint of the control stick. So it is a difficult question to answer.”
VGC got aslightlybetter answer, but one that doesn’t provide much clarity, either. “The control sticks for Joy-Con 2 controllers have been redesigned and have improved in areas such as durability,” a Nintendo spokesperson told the outlet.
But this is actually a topic players deserve an answer to. Polygon’s staff have sharedplentyof their ownfirsthandfrustrationswith Joy-Con drift, which usually causes whatever is being controlled to drift to the left, even if there’s no one touching the controller.
Hall-effect joysticks could solve this problem, as they utilize magnets and magnetic fields to register inputs, rather than physical contacts that could wear away over time. (My colleague Michael McWhertor wrote an excellent explainer onHall effect’s importance, with interviews from experts at iFixit, so please check that out for further reading.)
And Joy-Con drift has given Nintendo somewhat of a PR black eye, as it was hit with multipleclass-action lawsuitsover the issue in the U.S., though all have been dismissed. It also ledNintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa to apologizein a shareholder Q&A “for any trouble caused to our customers.”
It’s possible we won’t get an answer on Joy-Con 2’s internal workings until after the Switch 2 launches on June 5, and folks can start the teardown efforts widely.
Update:Nintendo Lifereports that the Joy-Con 2 controllers don’t feature Hall-effect joysticks. We’ve edited the story to include this.

"This week is pure action and pure puzzle
byTyler Colp
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
The new game releases this week give you two choices: puzzles or action. There’s really no in between. Action fans get to fight monsters with magical powers inSouth of Midnightor take on intense multiplayer heists inMonaco 2. Puzzle fans get to explore an ever-changing mansion inBlue Princeor take the time to unravel the mysteries ofThe Talos Principle: Reawakened.
It’ll be a tough decision if you like both genres, because most of these games drop on the same day, but a few of them are less traditional than others.Star Overdrivesticks out in the action category as a game with monsters to fight but also hoverboard tricks to pull off. AndJumping Jazz Catsis a game where the action consists of an army of cats racing to complete minigames.
Here are our most anticipated game releases for the week of April 7.
Release date:April 8Platforms:Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis action game is steeped in folklore and set in the American Deep South. The world is infested with gruesome monsters that seem to be pain and trauma made manifest. Your job as Hazel, a magic-wielding Weaver, is to mend your community and hopefully find a place to call home yourself.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis pitch for this puzzle game is like nightmare mode for anyone in fear of getting stumped. It’s set in a mansion where the rooms and their puzzles change as each day passes. The goal is to find Room 46, but you’ll need to be extremely clever to keep up with the constantly shifting obstacles.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThey put the philosophical puzzle game into Unreal Engine 5. This updated version has all kinds of new stuff, including a new chapter in the story, quality-of-life improvements, and a tool to make puzzles yourself.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis co-op heist game requires teamwork and clever thinking. You get to play as unique characters with tools to overcome the various security measures and guards in your way. Each level is procedurally generated, too, so every run will be slightly different.
Release date:April 10Platforms:Nintendo SwitchTony Hawk’s Pro SkatermeetsNo Man’s Skyin this hoverboard action game. You get to ride around on alien planets, solve puzzles, and pull off tricks. And as if this game didn’t sound cool enough, you also fight enemies with a keytar.
Release date:April 10Platforms:Windows PCI’m not going to lie to you: I mostly chose this game simply because it’s calledJumping Jazz Cats. But it also looks pretty fun. You and up to eight other players get to run around and play minigames as little cats. Well, they’re called “minigames,” but they look more like a bunch of excuses to absolutely wreck the house of your absent owners.

"Achievements? Never heard of ‘em
byTyler Colp
TheSwitch 2won’t be joining the Xbox and PlayStation consoles with its own system-wide achievements, Nintendo confirmed to Polygon in a recent interview.
When we asked vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen if we can expect achievements, he gave a pretty clear answer: “Nope.”
Just like on Switch 1, it’ll be up to game developers to implement them in their own way. Ubisoft games, for example, have their own achievement system tied to Ubisoft Connect. When you earn them, they won’t show up on your Nintendo profile. And that’s not going to change with Switch 2.
But even though a traditional achievement system won’t exist, Nintendo is still experimenting with someachievement-like systemsin theSwitch 2 versions ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom. Both games will let you earn medals on the Nintendo Switch phone app. When you do things like travel long distances or collect a large number of rupees, those will be tracked inside the Zelda Notes part of the app, and you’ll be able to see how you compare against other players around the world.
That’s about as close as you’re going to get to achievements on Switch 2. Nintendo isn’t going to reward you for finishing first place as the cow inMario Kart World; that’ll be on you to celebrate when theSwitch 2 releases in June.

"Nintendo has discovered QR codes
byTyler Colp
Friend codes continue to exist onNintendo Switch 2, but adding people will be slightly easier than it was on Switch 1, Nintendo confirmed to Polygon in a recent interview.
The heart of the friends list system on Switch 2 remains the same as it was on Switch 1. That’s why you can transfer it to the new console without much fuss. But the unique string of numbers that you have to punch in for every person you add is now optional.
You can scan a QR code with the Nintendo Switch phone app instead, vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen told Polygon. You can add notes for every friend too, which can help you remember who they are if they change their username.
Trinen said these improvements were important to make because of things likeGameChat, Nintendo’s Discord-like voice and video chat app. GameChat only works with your friends and even has a dedicated C button on the right Joy-Con. Trinen says the way it “replicates that face-to-face experience you get in the same room is crucial for what we want out of a chat system.”
In other words, Switch 2 won’t revolutionize how you add friends on Nintendo’s online service. You won’t be able to search for someone’s username and tap a button. You will need to find some other way outside of the console to share your friend or QR code with someone. Maybe when the third iteration of Switch comes out, Nintendo will join every other social platform in making this process less of a pain. But it won’t be doing that with Switch 2, which is set to launchin June.

"‘We tried doing something a little Nintendo-esque’
byMichael McWhertor
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
The Duskbloodswill be a departure forElden RingandDark Soulsdeveloper FromSoftware in more ways than one. In addition tofocusing on PvPvE multiplayer actionfor the Switch 2 exclusive,The Duskbloodswill apparently do away with the traditional, doll-like maidens that FromSoftware features in its games.
In their place? A nice, old winged rat.
Game directorHidetaka Miyazaki says in an interview with Nintendothat, like the focus on eight-player multiplayer, he wanted to try something new forThe Duskbloods’ equivalent of the Dark Souls Fire Keeper. Asked about the “winged rat character” seen at the end of the trailer for FromSoft’s new game, Miyazaki says, “That character shares a similar role with the fire keepers from the Dark Souls series. They remain in the hub area, providing the player with advice and guidance.”
Miyazaki says that the developer “tried doing something a little Nintendo-esque in the spirit of the partnership” with that character.
“We tried something cute for a change,” Miyazaki explains. “Although I will say this character is actually an elderly gentleman.”
That’s quite a change for FromSoft, which has thus far populated its games with comely and mysterious women who serve as guides for the player. (SeeDemon’s Souls’ Maiden in Black,Dark Souls’ various Fire Keepers,Dark Souls 2’s Emerald Herald,Dark Souls 3’s Fire Keeper,Bloodborne’s The Doll,Sekiro’s Emma, andElden Ring’s Melina and Ranni the Witch, for examples.)
Perhaps Miyazaki has found the value in elderly gentlemen as player guides for his games, based on the positive response toElden Ring’s Miriel, Pastor of Vows, otherwise known as the “Pope Turtle.” It is nice to mix things up now and then.
The Duskbloodswill be released on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026.

"No more shelling out big bucks just to play some great games
byIan Walker
When the Switch 2 arrives on June 5, it will do so with updated Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack offerings featuring GameCube titles as part of the service’s classics library, providing access to some hard-to-find and/or prohibitively expensive games in the process.
The initial GameCube offerings include all-time greatsThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Soulcalibur 2, andF-Zero GX, but things getreallyinteresting when you peruse the rest of the lineup. The group of Nintendo Switch Online GameCube games teased for the future —Super Mario Sunshine,Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance,Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness,Super Mario Strikers,Chibi-Robo, andLuigi’s Mansion— is comprised of arguable dark horse candidates for the best games on the console. That said, some of them can also be costly, and that’s only if you manage to find someone willing to sell.
Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, for instance, was the first 3D entry in the tactical roleplaying series and is often ranked by fans — alongside its direct Wii sequel,Radiant Dawn— among the best gameplay and storytelling the franchise has to offer. I was forced to play andalmostbeat both via successive rentals from my local Hollywood Video and never owned copies of my own. Unfortunately for anyone wanting to experience this wonderful game secondhand, however, it can be pretty difficult to find in the wild. Resell prices arecurrently hovering around $160for a loose disc or sometimes even over $200 if you want a complete-in-box copy.
Did Nintendo target these games on purpose? It’s still unclear, and their appearance on Nintendo Switch Online probably won’t do anything to lower their cost anyway. But for folks who just want to play the games rather than treat them as collectors items or investments, the Switch 2 could be a godsend. And, sure, while you can technically emulate older games, sometimes you just want a legitimate way to sit down with an old game without having to get your hands dirty trolling shady download sites and worrying about optimal program settings. Now all we have to contend with is the frankly random way in which the service adds games to its classic libraries.
The best way to stay up to date on all things Nintendo Switch 2.

"Proposed tariffs could raise prices by nearly 50%
byMichael McWhertor
Nintendo has delayed pre-orders in the United States for theSwitch 2in response to sweeping new tariffs outlined by the Trump administration earlier this week.Pre-orders were scheduled to begin on April 9, but have been delayed indefinitely, Nintendo said Friday.
Switch 2’s release datein the U.S. is still set for June 5.
“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,” Nintendo said in a statement provided to Polygon. “Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”
Nintendoannounced its next-generation consoleon Wednesday, setting theprice of Switch 2at $449.99. A few hours later, U.S. President Donald Trumpannounced “reciprocal tariffs” on dozens of countries, including territories where Nintendo manufactures its hardware. Trump hit China with an additional 34% duty on Wednesday, and hit Vietnam, where Nintendo has moved some of its production, with a 46% tariff. That could mean Switch 2’s already expensive price tag could go up even further for customers in the U.S.
Response to Nintendo’s prices for Switch 2 and games — which cost upward of $79.99 — for the system have been widely negative. During livestreams broadcast by Nintendo on Thursday and Friday, viewers unrelentingly spammed one request to the company: “Drop the price!” But with Trump escalating a trade war with double-digit tariffs on imported goods, it seems unlikely customers in the U.S. will see a price drop.
It’s unclear at this stage what the result of Nintendo’s assessment of Trump’s tariffs and “evolving market conditions” will ultimately mean for the launch of Switch 2. But in addition to increased costs, it could also mean a lower allocation of consoles for the U.S., which could make the system harder to find.

"Time to go back to the Korok Forest
byRuss FrushtickandSimone de Rochefort
Nintendo isdipping its toes into the hardware warwith its new console. The Switch 2 will supportDLSS technology and ray tracing, and it’ll launch withSwitch 2 editionsof its flagship Legend of Zelda Switch titles,Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom.
But what do these hardware upgrades actually get you?
We had a limited time with the Nintendo Switch 2 at the New York preview event, but we putBreath of the Wildto a simple test. How long does it take to fast-travel from Lanaryu Tower to the Shrine of Resurrection on the Switch 2, versus the original Switch?
When Link fast travels, he whooshes away in a stream of light, and then the game cuts to a loading screen. And it stays there.
By our math, that’s roughly a 35% improvement, and nothing to sneeze at. It’s no PS4 to PS5 jump, but the wait is noticeably shorter than it used to be. And any reduction in the time I’m spending staring at my reflection in the Switch’s screen is a win for me.
What’s more, we played a sequence in the Korok Forest, which wasnotoriously laggy on the original Nintendo Switch. In our demo of the Switch 2, we didn’t run into any of the same performance issues, with it maintaining a silky 60FPS throughout.
The Switch 2 will bemore expensive than Nintendo fans are used to paying, but at least in terms of performance, there are some real improvements.

"Game director Hidetaka Miyazaki wants to try something new with PvPvE
byMichael McWhertor
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Dark Souls developer FromSoftware surprised fans — and perplexed some — withthis week’s reveal of a new competitive multiplayer gamefor Switch 2,The Duskbloods. AlongsideElden Ring Nightreign, it’s the second multiplayer-forward game coming from the studio, which is best-known for its immersive role-playing games.
But there’s a reason whyThe Duskbloodsdirector Hidetaka Miyazaki is focusing heavily on competitive multiplayer. In anew interview with Nintendo, the game director and FromSoftware president says, “I’ve always found the PvPvE structure very interesting. It allows for a broad range of game-design ideas, while also letting us leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters.”
Miyazaki unpacks those game design ideas in the interview, saying that the playable characters inThe Duskbloods, which are known as Bloodsworn, have abilities that lend themselves to multiplayer action, including dashes, double jumps, and long-range attacks.
The Duskbloods’ setting, he says, “allows for the depiction of firearms and such, and every character is equipped with some means of attacking from a distance. I feel this is one of the game’s unique aspects when compared with our previous titles. I hope these new action elements are one area that players will enjoy.”
The eight-player PvPvE structure ofThe Duskbloodswill follow a last-player standing rule set, for the most part. But the win conditions in the game’s multiplayer matches vary; players may need to eliminate a specific player or team up with another to take down a boss. Or, they may receive new orders from that creepy moon with wings seen in the game’s reveal trailer.
Miyazaki says that, like past FromSoftware titles, “We’ve therefore designed the PvE boss encounters to present a tough challenge and a sense of accomplishment upon defeating them.”
He also confesses to being “not much of a PvP person,” explaining thatThe Duskbloods’ boss battles should satisfy the FromSoftware fans who come to their games for PvE. “Regardless of whether it’s PvP or PvE, the idea is to provide players with an experience that allows them to learn and hone their skills as they play,” Miyazaki says.
Miyazaki also acknowledges the PvP haters, promising that FromSoftware is not retreating from the tough, single-player focused games that made the studio a household name. “[The Duskbloods] is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward,“ Miyazaki says. “We still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as [Elden Ring] that embrace our more traditional style.“
FromSoftware’sElden Ringis coming to Switch 2 sometime in 2025 with an updated Tarnished Edition.The Duskbloodswill be released in 2026.

"﻿It turns out they’re hiding in plain sight
byOli Welsh
During anhourlong presentation on Wednesday, Nintendo bombarded prospective Switch 2 buyers with information about the new console and its games, including a torrent of ports from third-party publishers. But, once the dust had settled, it was easy to succumb to a creeping anxiety. Where were all the first-party launch titles from Nintendo itself?Mario Kart Worldlooks great, but isit $79.99 great?
Yes and no. Depending on how you define a launch game — and how you define a Switch 2 game — the Switch 2 will launch with anywhere between one and nine Nintendo games. You don’t have to expand these definitions to the absolute limit to realize that the Switch 2 is launching with relatively strong first-party support compared to Nintendo’s past systems. But it is true that Nintendo is approaching this launch a little differently.
First, a little historical perspective: In the last 20 years or so, new Nintendo consoles have launched with only two or three first-party games. For example, the Switch hadThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,1-2-Switch, andSnipperclips, a small eShop game. Further back, the Wii had the admittedly killerZelda: Twilight PrincessandWii Sportsdouble-header; the DS the more dubious pairing ofSuper Mario 64 DSandMetroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt.
In terms of Nintendo-made exclusive games, the Switch 2 has two titles on day one:Mario Kart WorldandNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour. But the latter is a download-only virtual guide to the hardware that most people wouldn’t consider a full launch title. So yes, compared to previous systems, it looks a little light.
But considerDonkey Kong Bananza, which is set for release on July 17 — just six weeks after the launch of the console. This is clearly a major new Nintendo platformer, and given what we know about Nintendo’s conservative approach to finishing games and setting launch dates, it seems likely the game would be ready to hit the June 5 launch day if Nintendo wanted it to. (It could well be finished already.)
It’s probable that Nintendo shiftedBananza’s launch date back as a deliberate marketing strategy, perhaps to extend the hype window beyond launch, perhaps to cover a second wave of stock. Or perhaps out of concern thatMario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananzamight cannibalize each other if launched together, because they’re both major titles. This is a key point. If we considerBananzaa launch title, and I think it’s only right to, then the Switch 2 is launching with two brand-new, exclusive Nintendo games of the highest order — which is arguably a first.
First-party support for Switch 2 goes even further when you considerSwitch 2 Editionsof existing Switch games. The system launches withenhanced versionsofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom, followed quickly in July bySuper Mario Party Jamboree, which has received a pretty extensive update tailored to the console’s GameChat features and camera. In August, Nintendo will release an expanded version ofKirby and the Forgotten Landwith a whole new storyline. Some of these upgrades, especially the Mario Party and Kirby releases, seem substantial enough to be compared to the Deluxe Switch versions of Wii U games likeMario Kart 8andNew Super Mario Bros. U.
(You can only get to nine first-party launch games by including the threeGameCube reissues, exclusive to Switch 2, on Nintendo Switch Online:The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Soulcalibur 2, andF-Zero GX. This is pushing it, I admit, although I would bet these will be some of my most-played games in my first weeks with the new console.)
Through the rest of 2025, we’ll getDrag x Drive,Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,Kirby Air Riders, and Switch 2 Editions ofMetroid Prime 4: BeyondandPokémon Legends: Z-A. All in all, across Switch 2 exclusives and Switch 2 Editions, Nintendo announced 12 titles coming in 2025 during Wednesday’s Direct.
That’s a lot of games by any measure. (Certainly compared to the first-party support given to Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 in their first nine months on the market.) It just looks different, partly because Nintendo is choosing to spread out its release dates, and partly because Switch 2 Editions are a more diffuse concept than the ports and remasters that have been Nintendo’s stock-in-trade on previous consoles. Nintendo is certainly hedging its bets a little with two of its biggest 2025 games,Metroid Prime 4: BeyondandPokémon Legends: Z-A, also coming to the Switch. But however you cut it, Switch 2 first-party support is a lot stronger than it might have seemed at first.

"A rigorous experiment with Nintendo’s new controllers
byChelsea Stark
There’s a lot to talk about since theSwitch 2 reveal, and one of the jokey-but-not questions from many folks is:Will the Switch 2 mouse work on my pants?
Which makes sense! Rarely are we doing handheld or console gaming with a table in front of us, let alone a large, luxurious desk mat like the ones at theNintendo Switch 2hands-on event held in New York. I already wrote a bit onhow it feels to play with the Joy-Con’s mouse feature, but let’s get specific: How well does it work on pants? And various other non-mousepad surfaces?
The mouse worked on my corduroy pants no problem, both while aiming duringMetroid Prime 4: Beyond, and when using both Joy-Cons during the strangeDrag x Drivegame. I had to drag both hands across my legs at once to drive the robot wheelchair, but it did work!But I couldn’t just stop there. Urged on by coworkers back home, I tried the mouse on basically any surface I had access to. Does the mouse work on the bare skin of my arm? Yup. The aluminum back of my Macbook Air? Yup. A leather wallet? The only limiting factor there was the surface being small, but the mouse worked.
I asked my friend and former Polygon stafferMegan Farohkmanesh, who confirmed it also worked on her tights. Finally, I tried to use the mouse on the top of my head, for a stunt nobody would actually repeat while gaming. Did it work? Yes. I’m sure TikTok loves this footage.
So generally, will it mouse? Yes. Should it? Probably not, but you can’t doubt my commitment to the bit.

"﻿It hasn’t gone well for Sony. But Nintendo’s strategy is a bit different
byOli Welsh
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
During Wednesday’sSwitch 2 Direct, Nintendo revealed that some games for the original Switch could be upgraded to enhancedSwitch 2 Editionsby purchasing an upgrade pack. This isn’t surprising, coming from a company that has long loved to repackage old games for new consoles and sell them to fans a second (or third, or fourth) time. But it left some observers feeling that Nintendo was nickel-and-diming its fans — and it’s a strategy that comes with risks.
When launching a console that’sfully backward-compatible with its predecessor’s games, console makers have some tricky choices to make. One of the trickiest involves how to handle pricing and upgrades when there are versions of the same game for both platforms — particularly if the platform holder is increasing the price of games on the new system (as Nintendo is).
Both Sony and Microsoft were faced with this conundrum when they launched their most recent consoles, and they made very different choices. Microsoft’s policy is both generous and simple: Any Xbox One games are upgraded to Xbox Series X editions automatically and at no extra cost. If you own the newer console, you can rest easy that you are always playing the best version of the game without thinking about it, and without shelling out for it.
Sony’s policy is a bit less generous, and much more confusing. Some upgrades from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5 versions of games are free. (Quite a few, to be fair.) Many are not; it costs $10 to upgrade a copy ofMarvel’s Spider-ManorGrand Theft Auto 5to the PS5 version, for example. Sometimes this upgrade path was only available for a limited time. Sometimes it’s not available at all, and your only option, if you already own the game on PS4, is to buy it all over again on PS5.
Understandably, this messy, costly system didn’t go down well with PlayStation players. WhenHorizon Forbidden Westwas announced with no upgrade path, fans were so upset that Sony was forced to back down,offer a free upgrade, and pledge to always offer upgrades in the future (albeit for a price). This is the minefield that Nintendo is now stepping into.
There are a few caveats, however. Firstly, Nintendo did not announce pricing for its upgrade packs, and how players feel about the upgrades will depend to a large extent on where this pricing lands. Also, will the upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which improves performance and comes with somecompanion-app features, cost the same as theSwitch 2upgrade forKirby and the Forgotten Land, which adds a whole new expansion to the game? Maybe, maybe not. To complicate things further, theSwitch 2 Edition upgrades forBreath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomwill be included in a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription, but others won’t.
That’s not all. Nintendo is also offering asecond tier of free Switch 2 patchesfor games likeSuper Mario OdysseyandPokémon ScarletandViolet. These don’t count as full Switch 2 Editions, but they will “improve playability” and “may improve performance or add support for features such asGameShare,” depending on the game.
As with PS5, it’s quite a confusing picture — especially since we don’t yet know pricing, or how third-party publishers will choose to handle Switch 2 Editions. (On PlayStation, many — if not most — opted to offer free upgrades.) But there is one important factor that distinguishes Nintendo’s strategy from Sony’s.
The only enhancements offered by many PS5 upgrades were in terms of visuals and performance: higher resolutions and frame rates, ray-traced lighting, or new performance and quality modes. Players felt they were being asked to spend $10 per game to unlock the power of the console they had already bought.
Nintendo seems to have a policy that visual upgrades aren’t enough for a Switch 2 Edition. The Zelda games come with the (admittedly not very compelling) Zelda Notes companion features.Super Mario Party Jamboreehas a new play mode, and makes extensive use of Switch 2 features like mouse controls and the camera.Kirby and the Forgotten Landhas a whole new story.Metroid Prime 4: Beyondhas mouse controls. It seems clear that Nintendo always wants to add value in a Switch 2 Edition, either through additional content, use of the Switch 2’s unique features (beyond its increased processing power), or both. Some of these releases — Kirby and Mario Party especially — would seem to be on a par with the Switch’s Deluxe editions of Wii U games likeMario Kart 8andNew Super Mario Bros. U. (There’s one exception to this rule: The Switch 2 Edition ofPokémon Legends: Z-Adoes not feature any upgrades beyond a visual one, at least for now.)
That should make the upgrade pack cost, however much it may be, easier to stomach. (Charging for upgrade packs will surely make all that extra development time easier for Nintendo to stomach.) It’s a fairer proposition than Sony’s, if hardly a less confusing one. But Xbox owners — and PC gamers, for that matter, who never have to worry about such things — would be justified in feeling quite smug by comparison.

"Wild peripherals for the Switch 2 are already starting to sprout up
byAlice Jovanée
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Perhaps one of the more unexpected announcements to arrive out of the Nintendo Switch Direct is that theNintendo Switch 2will have a camera peripheral to supplement the console’s new group chat feature. While the Switch 2 will be compatible withthird-party USB-C webcams, the peripheral manufacturers at Hori are already producing their own adorable version of a camera for the Switch 2 modeled after the Piranha Plant.
Specifics surrounding the carnivorous camera are a bit slim. It isn’t currently advertised on the manufacturer’s website, and it has only been spotted in the wild at European retailerMediamarkt, which has the product listed for around $44, about $6 cheaper than thefirst-party model advertised by Nintendo. It appears that the stem will be detachable from the base and is flexible, to ensure you have the best possible angle. However, the coolest feature is that its mouth can be closed as a privacy shutter for the camera when not in use. Nintendo’s official camera for the Switch 2 has a similar feature, but I’m glad we’re already starting to see weird peripherals for the new console taking root.

A slew of new amiibo were quietly revealed in addition toall the Switch 2 infoshared on April 2, confirming details gleaned from Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filingsa month ago.
Thenew figures, based on characters fromThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the KingdomandStreet Fighter 6, will launch alongside theSwitch 2on June 5. Six Sage descendants Tulin, Yunobo, Riju, and Sidon represent the Zelda franchise, while Street Fighter newcomers Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly join the previously released Ryu and Ken figures as part of the fighting game’s amiibo offerings.
As with past releases, all of these new amiibo will unlock special content in their respective games. A figure based on Mineru’s Construct fromTears of the Kingdomis also planned for the future.
Despite an FCC filing indicating the new Joy-Con 2 controllers would maintain amiibo support on Switch 2, it was unclear whether or not Nintendo intended to release more figures. That sound you just heard was collectors and completionists groaning in agony over learning they’ll need to continue getting up early to hunt down limited supplies of these silly little plastic doodads.

"The Switch 2 is a souped-up handheld gaming PC in Nintendo clothes
byCameron Faulkner
A custom Nvidia processor is at the heart of theNintendo Switch 2, giving it power to push up to 120 frames per second in handheld mode, or up to 4K at 60 frames per second while docked.
While Nintendo has been cagey to share more details on its partnership with the graphics and AI giant, Nvidia published ashort press releaseconfirming the collaboration — and diving a little more deeply into the tech found in Nintendo’s surprisingly capable handheld.
It name-dropped a lot of features that are commonly tossed around in the world of PC gaming. For one, the Switch 2’s 7.9-inch 1080p LCD display has G-Sync support baked in, and its variable refresh rate (VRR) support will ensure that you won’t notice fluctuations in frame rate as easily. Nvidia shared that the Switch 2 has “10x the graphical performance of the Nintendo Switch,” and that it uses DLSS to upscale graphics in games. Also, developers will be able to take advantage of ray tracing in the Switch 2.
Additionally, Nvidia’s tech supports other tentpole features of the Switch 2, includingGameChat. Nvidia’s AI Tensor Cores are used to focus on face tracking while removing the background (giving that green screen streamer look).
“With 1,000 engineer-years of effort across every element — from system and chip design to a custom GPU, APIs and world-class development tools — the Nintendo Switch 2 brings major upgrades,” says Nvidia’s press release.

"Last time we asked, you predicted it’d be $399…
byZoë Hannah
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Nintendo held off announcing the price of theSwitch 2in its bigSwitch 2 Directon Wednesday. Instead, perhaps in preparation for the inevitable sticker shock, the $449 price point was slipped into a news release tucked away in a bevy of other facts. Nintendo also announced that a limited-supply bundle that comes with a copy ofMario Kart Worldwould retail for $499.99. The Mario Kart sequel runs $80 as a standalone game.
Even with rampant inflation of the U.S. economy, theSwitch 2 remains one of Nintendo’s most expensive consoles ever. Further, it’s crossing theonce-sacred $70 price pointfor games — a relatively ubiquitous price for AAA games that most major studios generally adhere to. (That price point has crept up over the years, with first-party Switch 1 games going for $60 in most cases.)
In the wake of Nintendo’s pricey announcements, we’ve seen reactionsfrom folks all across the internet, and even in our own personal group chats with friends, land all over the place. In January, wepredicted that the console would be sold at $399, and in our reader survey, almost 57% of you agreed with us. Just 9% of our respondents predicted that the Switch 2 would cost $449. So now the question stands: Will you buy a Switch 2 for $449.99?
With Switch 2 pre-orders set for April 9, the Nintendo Switch 1still retails for $299.99— the same price as when it launched. The Switch OLED stillgoes for $349.99, and has also never been discounted. A Switch Lite continuesto go for $199.99. Nintendo’s Switch 2competitors, like theValve Steam Deckand theROG Ally X, retail for anywhere from $399 to just under $600, depending on how much storage you’d like.
So tell us: Will you buy the Switch 2? Vote in our poll and sound off in the comments to make your case.

"Testing the ergonomics of Nintendo’s new console
byRuss Frushtick
If you were handed aNintendo Switch 2, you might not initially realize it. Sure, it might feel a little bigger in the hand, but otherwise the experience of holding Nintendo’s long-awaited follow-up feels familiar, with all the pluses and minuses that go along with that.
Delving a bit deeper, though, the improvements do become apparent. You just have to hunt for them.
When in handheld mode, the Switch 2 is about an inch wider and a half-inch taller than the original Switch. This increased size allows the Joy-Con 2 controllers to hug the new 7.9-inch screen, which is also noticeably bigger than the original Switch’s 6.2-inch display. While playingMario Kart World, I really appreciated the increased screen real estate, allowing me to soak up the image of a cow on a motorcycle doing backflips over Donkey Kong. But I was surprised to find that the increased size really helped with the ergonomics of the device as well.
It’s no secret that the original Nintendo Switch was a one-way ticket to Hand Cramptown. I can’t say that the Switch 2 will alleviate all of the issues people had when playing games in handheld mode, but I have some hope. Because the Joy-Con 2 controllers are a bit longer, I was able to fully grip the controller without my pinkie and ring fingers dangling uselessly under the console. More fingers on the device itself means more support and therefore less wrist and hand strain when playing for long periods of time.
Unfortunately, this is entirely subjective, and someone with smaller hands might not have the same experience. In fact, Polygon’s Chelsea Stark felt that the comfort levels were pretty comparable between the original Switch and the Switch 2, but did note that she really felt the weight difference — the Switch 2 is about 34% heavier, weighing 1.18 pounds with both Joy-Cons attached.
I found the increased size of the new Joy-Cons to be beneficial in other ways. If you’ve ever played a multiplayer game using a single Joy-Con tilted on its side, you understand misery. On the Switch 2, that experience is measurably improved on a few fronts: For one, the added size makes it so the buttons and analog stick aren’t right on top of each other, and your hands aren’t quite so smashed together as they were when holding the teeny-tiny original Joy-Con. The tiny, rectangular trigger buttons in this solo Joy-Con mode are also elevated and far easier to press on the Joy-Con 2, so drifting inMario Kart Worldwill be that much more viable in this setting. Is it as good as holding your own dedicated controller? It is not. It still feels weird and offset, a consequence of the Joy-Con having to work for both handheld and solo play, but it’ll work in a pinch.
Size improvements have also been made to the analog sticks and face buttons, which are slightly larger than they were before. When using Joy-Con 2s in the new grip controller, it didn’t feel like I was totally hamstrung not having a full Pro Controller, like I would have been with the original Switch’s grip. I still don’t think I’d want to play a 60-hour Zelda adventure using just the grip — mostly because swapping between the right analog stick and face buttons still feels unnatural because of the way they’re stacked — but it might allow me to eke out some more play time before having to call it quits.
There are also more subtle differences that make using the Switch 2 far more enjoyable than the original. Connecting a Joy-Con 2 to the device using the new magnetic attachment feels incredible, as it clicks securely into place without the slight wiggle you might have felt with the original Switch’s rail system. There’s also a significantly stronger rumble hiding within the Switch, capable of boosting the feedback with a lot more fervor than before.
But with these improvements, it’s hard not to feel like there’s a pretty significant downgrade in comfort and playability when sticking with the stock Joy-Con 2s over, say, the new Switch 2 Pro Controller. If you play a lot of games, it does feel like the Pro Controller will be a mandatory purchase. Thanks to the new kickstand and the larger screen size, tabletop play does become a much more viable option than before. (It’s a good thing the Switch 2 will bebackward-compatible with the original Switch Pro Controller.)
After eight years, I was hoping more would have been done to make the ergonomics of the Switch 2 a dramatic improvement. The goal of allowing the Joy-Con 2s to function in a variety of circumstances (attached to the tablet, in one hand, sideways as a mini controller, and even as a mouse), probably has a significant impact on making something comfortable to hold for long periods of time. Which is to say: Third-party accessory manufacturers will once again swoop in with all sorts of zany grip solutions to make the Switch 2 a cushier experience. It’s just a shame that Nintendo wasn’t able to solve all of these problems on its own.

"We played Metroid Prime 4 with a Joy-Con mouse. Here’s what that’s like
byChelsea Stark
We played Metroid Prime 4 with a Joy-Con mouse. Here’s what that’s like
byChelsea Stark
Nintendo announced that its Switch 2 Joy-Cons could beused as a mouse— in either hand, even — during itsSwitch 2 Directon April 2. Mice and other pointers have been aiding in making certain game movements more precise for decades, so the idea of a console-based mouse is tempting, if it’s implemented well.
During a hands-on event in New York City on Wednesday, I was able to test the Joy-Cons’ mouse mode on a few different gameplay experiences specifically designed to highlight it. Nintendo is a company known for unique (or sometimes gimmicky) implementations of control schemes, yet the mouse has had decades of refinement for computer gaming. Some of the experiences I had using the Joy-Con as a mouse felt traditional, but some left me scratching my head as to whether they would receive wider adoption.
The new Joy-Con — called Joy-Con 2 — has been given extra heft and sturdiness compared to the first iteration. They fill my hands a bit more comfortably without being too much wider. When I’m sliding them on their sides, it doesn’t seem like they will accidentally tip over. I found that the mouse could also register on different types of surfaces; while Nintendo provided nice, cushy, desk-sized mouse pads to use during demos, I also triedsliding the mouse up and down my corduroy pantsto simulate “gamer conditions” of playing in the wild. There really wasn’t too much of a difference, as long as the surface was wide enough to handle a mouse swipe.
For a demo ofMetroid Prime 4:Beyond, I used the mouse (while standing at a desk, which felt slightly awkward!) to gun down enemies. The movement felt mostly comparable to that of any first-person shooter I’ve played on a computer — although in PC games, mouse controls aren’t usually paired with the lock-on technology Samus still uses inBeyond. But it did feel fairly natural to aim and look around with the Joy-Con mouse. This was slightly complicated by the fact that the face buttons were now rotated, so finding the right one was less intuitive while trying to scan doors, fire missiles, or activate Samus’ morph ball mode. I felt like I was constantly hitting the wrong button during my demo because of the adjustment.
The end of theMetroid Prime 4demo featured a boss covered in glowing weak spots for which I couldn’t use the auto lock-on, meaning I had to rely on the mouse’s precision aiming — or lack thereof, due to the removal of lock-on mechanics — to take it down. I wonder how much this will feature in the full game, and if the Switch 2 version of the game will highlight the mouse more than the Switch version.
Meanwhile, inDrag x Drive, using the Joy-Con as a mouse was less about aiming and precision and more about endlessly sliding it. In a game that feels meant to highlight Switch 2 features rather than be fun, I was endlessly swiping with both hands to build speed as a little robot wheelchair user, then swiping one or the other Joy-Con mouse to turn. The idea is easy to understand, but despite it feeling like a smaller-scale version of rowing, I struggled for a bit to figure out how to move smoothly. Thankfully, throwing passes to my teammates or making baskets felt very generous, because most of my time withDrag x Drivewas spent just on mastering movement. It’s hard for me to envision setting this game up in a room with the amount of space I might need for the mouse movements, even if I could use my legs instead of a flat surface.
I’m so curious to see this concept extended to other games beyond these demos, as a mouse has so much potential for console gaming. But it might require dedicated resources for developers to figure out how to best implement the Switch 2’s mouse functionality — it’s really not like anything else out there, since it can work in either (or even both) of the user’s hands but will still need to accommodate button presses on the Joy-Con as well.

"Though the racing is pretty good, too
byChelsea Stark
Mario Kart Worldanswers the question, “How do you followMario Kart 8?” While the previous entry became fully stuffed with new and throwback racetracks, playingMario Kart Worldat Nintendo’s hands-onSwitch 2preview event blew up all my assumptions of what a Mario Kart track can be — and what the future could hold for the franchise.
The arcade racer hasn’t yet strayed from its format, but that’s about to change whenMario Kart Worldis released alongside the Switch 2 on June 5. In the time I spent withMario Kart Worldduring the preview event, I most enjoyed all the times I wasn’t strictly racing. I was just driving and vibing.
We loaded up for a massive game of Knock-out Tour, where 24 folks compete in a marathon-style race across ever-changing terrain. But because I happened to be one of the first to pick up a console, I spent a long time waiting for everyone else — but not idly. Instead, I was able to drive wherever I wanted across the landscape.
First, I drifted down a snowy road, feeling how my heavy car’s tires dug in the deeper snow off the track. I vaulted across a ramp, soaring longer and farther than I ever had in a Mario Kart game before. I weaved through busy highways, which were a mix of normal vehicles and some extra-large Nintendo variants, some spewing gold coins in their wake. I even whipped around quickly and drove against traffic to get a closer look at a mushroom diner sign that I had missed on my last pass by.
As an aside:Mario Kart Worldseems packed with Nintendo nostalgia, and primed for poring over by superfans. The world is full of small Easter eggs you might not see while racing by, or other drivers you may pass on the road. (I yelled in delight when I got passed by the penguin fromMario 64!) But in Knock-out Tour, I had the option to take roads at my own pace, which feels luxurious, instead of throwing a race for the sake of seeing some detail.
Comparisons toForza Horizon 5seem apt, as it feels like I’m just cruising around until the event starts. While there may not be as robust driving options — Mario Kart is still an arcadey game! — I enjoyed the drive. I wanted to see what was around the next bend, with so many terrain and track types merging together seamlessly.
It also takes off the pressure of responding to items or dealing with the actual race. One of my longstanding criticisms of Mario Kart is how it isn’t always your fault if you lose, and that’s still true on the extremely long Knock-out Tour. I was knocked out pretty early — partially my fault for picking a character based on aesthetics. (Sorry to the beefcake biker version of Bowser; you’re very heavy!)
But it did make me curious and excited to try out the Free Roam mode advertised in Wednesday’s Direct, which seems to offer a lot more variety in driving. (You’ll also drive between courses in a cup, but the hands-on demos only rotated me through single tracks.)
There are so many other things to appreciate: the weird new items, which I haven’t seen all of yet; thesurprisingly deep bench of charactersavailable as drivers. But I can’t wait to cruise around uninhibited and take them in at my own pace.

"Several new features are tied to a phone app
byTyler Colp
On top of the improved graphical performance for theSwitch 2 versions ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom, there will be a suite of new features in the Nintendo Switch phone app, including an achievement system and, strangely, a voice navigation assistant.
The new service inside the Switch app is called Zelda Notes. It only works for theSwitch 2versions, and is “designed to provide a more streamlined gameplay experience,” according to theoverview trailer.
The app has achievement-like medals you can earn for doing things like traveling long distances, defeating enemies, collecting rupees, and other metrics. Medals are tracked globally and you can view what other players have earned compared to yourself in the app, too.
All I can say is that it’s a very Nintendo move to add achievements to only two Switch 2 games that exist solely on a service inside of an app. You could speculate on whether this means Nintendo is gearing up to finally make its own version of achievements in the year 2025, but we all know within ourselves that this is probably a weird one-off thing we’ll never see again.
Another major feature of Zelda Notes is voice navigation, which looks a lot like a GPS assistant that can tell you where to find things like Koroks, Skyview Towers, Shrines, and more. In the short demo, a player selects a map icon on their phone and the voice calls out directions to a Korok hidden under a rock inTears of the Kingdom.
To me, it’s an odd feature to include for two open-world games about the joys of exploring and discovering things. There’s no shame in using guides when you’re stumped, but I’m not sure these games would be as much fun if you spent the entire time being told where to go. It makes more sense to use it for finding something in a pinch or cleaning up what you missed. Honestly, I’m having trouble trying to think of who Nintendo thinks this is for.
One of the things you can use the navigation assistant to find are a bunch of new voice memories from Zelda, King Rauru, and Master Kohga. These short audio diaries are scattered around the world and let you hear the characters’ thoughts on locations and moments in Hyrule’s history. All the Zelda lore heads out there will have a new reason to boot up their old save files.
The app also lets you share blueprints for yourTears of the Kingdombuilds — a feature that would’ve been nice two years ago — as well as gift items to other players, edit screenshots, roll for small daily in-game bonuses, and get rewards for scanning amiibo.
The Zelda Notes service will go live inside the Nintendo Switch app on June 5, the same daythe Switch 2 launches, along with the upgraded versions ofBreath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom.

"Apparently Donkey Kong is basically the Hulk
byRuss Frushtick
While watching the bigNintendo Switch 2 Direct, I’m sure I wasn’t alone in expecting the long-awaited follow-up toSuper Mario Odyssey. When the final trailer kicked off with lush, cartoony environs, it seemed clear that the expectation was about to become reality. But nope, Nintendo’s big surprise game was actuallyDonkey Kong Bananza, a new 3D adventure game starring the king of the Kongs.
But is this just a palette swap? Maybe the developers wanted to make a new 3D platformer, but to mix it up they slotted in Donkey Kong instead of Mario. Effectively, is this the sequel toMario Odysseywe’ve been waiting for?
Big time not.
After having spent 30 minutes playing the game at Nintendo’s press event Wednesday, I can say thatDonkey Kong Bananzamight be the most “fuck everything up” game Nintendo has ever made. Seconds into controlling Donkey Kong, I was set loose in a mine staffed by very sad chimpanzees. And no, I wasn’t there to save them. Apparently this next generation of DK is very obsessed with Bananium, a mineral that looks a heck of a lot like gold and I guess tastes like bananas.
The gameplay consists of Donkey Kong just sprinting through the mine breaking literally everything around him. He’s busting holes in walls, he’s throwing huge boulders — he’s a very mobile, very hungry wrecking ball. There was very little platforming involved, in fact, with much more of a focus on wrecking shit. Every button and trigger but one results in some wrecking-shit variant. There’s the standard horizontal punch, there’s a ground slam, there’s a ground drum (for sending nearby pickups into the air for collection), there’s a grab and throw for hurling boulders. You are just marching around the environments fucking shit up.
This can feel a bit chaotic — and actually resulted in some motion sickness, requiring me to turn down some of the sensitivity settings — but it was a blast. The meditative platforming you might find in a Mario game has been replaced by something entirely different, and entirely in line with Donkey Kong’s persona. Dude loves bananas and wrecking shit.
The game does have some purpose to it. Sometimes you are given mini objectives to keep things moving, like using exploding boulders to open up new pathways. And there are a ton of collectibles hidden within the walls and underground to uncover. The levels appear to be quite large and seemingly filled with a number of different paths you can go down, makingBananzafeel much more in line with what you’d expect from a major first-party Nintendo release. But all of that felt secondary to the pure joy of destroying the world around me.
I cleared out a particularly gold-filled area, only to look back on the chaos I had wrought. It was like a tornado had whipped through the heart of the mine, and no one was spared.

"Old man yells at The Cloud
byChristopher Grant
It’s a good thing that theNintendo Switch 2comes with a base 256 GB of internal storage — eight times more than the original Switch’s paltry 32 GB — because some Nintendo Switch 2 games won’t come on the cartridge at all. Instead, so-called game-key cards will simply contain a “key” that you will use to download the game, according toa support page on Nintendo’s website.
“After it’s downloaded, you can play the game by inserting the game-key card into your system and starting it up like a standard physical game card,” the page reads. Here’s how that looks on the retail packaging:
Some additional fine print on how this works:
An internet connection is only required when you launch the game for the first time. After this, the game can be started even without an internet connection. However, like regular physical software, the game-key card must be inserted into the system in order to play the game.
In some ways, this is a new spin on an old trick. Some Nintendo Switch games have been sold at retail, but the packaging simply included a code used to download the game to your account. To be fair, this hasn’t been as common on Switch as it has been on competing consoles, but nevertheless, for the people still committed to purchasing physical games, it riles. This is, in fact, the same tactic that Microsoft (in)famously unveiled alongside the Xbox One; of course, that was over a decade ago, and consumer sentiment has changed. We’re all Game Passing and PS Plus-ing our games, and maybe potentially feel some “ownership” over the digital goods we’re purchasing on Steam. Maybe.
But I’m one of those physical media people! First, I’m scientifically “old.” I was born in the 1970s, my first job was at a video store (ask your parents), and I still have a large collection of video games (and video game consoles ?). I understand that I am not the target demographic, in many ways. But also, until the Switch, the prospect of purchasing digital Nintendo games was foolish! If you lost your Nintendo DS or 3DS on a bus — a not-unheard-of scenario for a portable game console — your digital purchases were gone. Here I am yelling aboutNintendo’s shoddy online servicesin2012 just before the launch of the Wii U, and again in2017 just before the launch of the Switch.
The good news: I don’t need to write that same piece again! Nintendo has kinda figured this out. I still buy my Switch games in cartridge format, not because I’m afraid of losing the Switch (and, by extension, my entire library), but because doing so makes it easier to share games with friends and family, including people in my own household. But I also genuinely worry about what happens when companies — and maybe, specifically here, Nintendo — take their own game servers offline. Can I download what I bought?How do I play older gamesI care about? Microsoft has been working to address theunsatisfactory vibes of digital ownership, and I often point out that my Steam library persists even as so (so, so) many of the developers and publishers behind the games in my Steam library no longer do.
So let’s call this a sign of the times. We don’t know how often Nintendo and its publishing partners will use this “game-key card” solution, and maybe in some cases it’s the right answer — surely some games will simply be too large to fit on this storage device. Switch game cards capped out at 32 GB, while thecoming-to-Switch-2Cyberpunk 2077comes on a massive 64 GB game card, according to a press release. That’s a lot of expensive one-time storage, and with the Switch 2 competing with the PlayStations and Xboxes of the world foreven more third-party titles, you can imagine storage requirements going up from there. Even if it maybe makes sense, I don’t have to like it.
[Update: Added details on theCyberpunk 2077game card size, and information on internet requirements to use game-key cards.]

"Nintendo’s eShop will reportedly be a smoother experience on the new console
byTyler Colp
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Navigating the eShop on the Nintendo Switch is a trial. Not only does it chug when you’re scrolling through games, it’s borderline impossible to find exactly what you want. Even new games are sometimes hard to find. And there areentire websitesdedicated to doing the heavy lifting for you so you don’t ever have to engage with it. It’s a mess that hasn’t been cleaned up for years.
According to Nintendo developers in arecent official interview, Switch 2’s updated eShop won’t be as awful to use.
“Thanks to the system’s performance capabilities, Nintendo eShop onSwitch 2has been improved and runs smoothly even when displaying a large number of games,” Takuhiro Dohta, senior director of the entertainment, planning, and development department said.
A new Game Finds for You feature on the eShop will highlight screenshots and videos of recommended games. Producer of the entertainment, planning, and development department Kouichi Kawamoto believes it will help you “easily find something interesting without having to search every nook and cranny of the Nintendo eShop.”
That’s good news, because the eShop is currently overrun with clones of popular games, likeUnpacking, and games usinggenerative AI artwith no clear disclaimers. Nintendo didn’t specifically comment on this in the interview, but official curation could be a way around it.
Other common issues with the eShop’s poor search results and wonky wishlist integration weren’t mentioned either. All we have is an extremely brief clipwithin the interview transcriptshowing what the new interface will look like, but it’s too short to get into the details of how everything will work.
Nintendo didn’t spend a lot of time talking about the eShop during theSwitch 2 Directtoday. Instead, the company focused onnew gamesandnew features. Let’s just hope the eShop gets the upgrades it’s needed for so long, so discovering new games isn’t such a pain.

Nintendo confirmed back in November 2024, two months before the company evenunveiled the Nintendo Switch 2, that the new console would bebackward-compatible with games for the original Nintendo Switch. Now, after detailing the system’s hardware and software in anhourlong Nintendo Direct presentation, the company has provided the first real specifics on the nature of Switch 2’s backward compatibility.
We now know that theSwitch 2will work with many Switch accessories — including, most importantly, the original console’s Joy-Cons and Pro Controller — as well as games. But as Nintendo has previously hinted, not every Switch game will be playable (or, at least, fully playable) on the Switch 2. Here’s what we’ve learned so far.
Yes, Nintendo confirmed in its April 2 Nintendo Direct that the Switch 2 will support both physical and digital copies of Switch games. The size of the cartridge isn’t changing; it’s just that Game Cards for the Switch 2 will be red, as opposed to the gray ones for the original Switch. (They’ll also have “much faster data reading speeds” than the old ones, said Tetsuya Sasaki, hardware design lead for the Switch 2, in the Nintendo Direct.)
The Switch 2 doesn’t contain any hardware from the original Switch, and Nintendo isn’t relying on software emulation for backward compatibility, either. Instead, the company’s solution falls “somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility,” said Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta in anAsk the Developer interview published by Nintendo. Sasaki explained, “The process of converting game data for Switch to run on Switch 2 is performed on a real-time basis as the data is read in,” which makes it sound similar to the way Proton gets Windows PC games to run on the Linux-basedSteam Deck.
This method allows for adding Switch 2 features, such asGameChatsupport, to Switch games played via backward compatibility. Dohta added, “We believe there are many things we can do, such as making Switch games compatible with GameShare through free updates, as well as leveraging Switch 2’s processing power to enable games to run in higher resolution and with a smoother frame rate.”
Nintendo has not indicated that the Switch 2 will provide across-the-board improvements to graphics or performance when running Switch games, although that will happen with some games. It appears that it will be up to developers and publishers to issue patches to deliver these upgrades.
So far, Nintendo has detailed two different strategies for upgrading first-party Switch games. Select titles — thelist on the Nintendo websitecurrently features a dozen — will get “free updates to improve playability on the Nintendo Switch 2 system.” The games in question run the gamut from launch-year titles likeSuper Mario Odysseyto recent releases such asThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. In addition to performance improvements, these patches can add elements like support for Switch 2 features such asGameShare.
The other upgrade route sounds like it will offer more significant additions and improvements to certain Switch games — but this one will cost you money. Nintendo will sell what it calls an “upgrade pack” for these titles; the company hasn’t yet said how much it will charge. A bundle of a game and its upgrade pack will be known as a “Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.”
At this point, the company has announced upgrade packs for six games:Kirby and the Forgotten Land,The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,Super Mario Party Jamboree, and the upcoming titlesMetroid Prime 4: BeyondandPokémon Legends: Z-A(both of which are scheduled to launch in 2025).
The details vary greatly depending on the game. For the new Pokémon game, all you get is “improved performance with higher frame rate and resolution.” Both of theZelda upgradeswill deliver that, along with faster load times, HDR, and support for the new Zelda Notes service.Metroid Prime 4: Beyondwill be playable on Switch 2 with mouse controls, thanks to the Joy-Con 2. And the upgrade packs for bothSuper Mario Party JamboreeandKirby and the Forgotten Landwill offer new content.
That would be a tall order, and the answer is no — but the level of support, as seen ona page on the Nintendo website that details the Switch 2’s backward-compatibility functionality, does seem impressive so far.
Nintendo is currently working its way through the entire library of Switch games one by one, conducting “limited testing” with each game to see if it works on the Switch 2. “It might not be that all Switch games run perfectly in time for the launch of Switch 2, but we will continue our efforts so that we can support as many Switch games as possible,” said Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto in the Ask the Developer interview.
Nintendo says that as of April 1, it has tested 122 first-party Switch titles and found only one that doesn’t work with the Switch 2 —Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit. That package came with a cardboard contraption that turned the Switch into a pair of virtual reality goggles, and the Switch 2 is a bigger device, so it simply can’t fit into it.
However,Nintendo Labo won’t be completely dead on the Switch 2: Toy-Con 01, Toy-Con 02, and Toy-Con 03 will each work to some degree. Those three titles and six otherscan only be played on the Switch 2 using Joy-Cons from the original Switch, because they rely on something unique about those controllers. Some games, likeWarioWare: Move It!, need the infrared camera in the right Joy-Con, which doesn’t exist in the Joy-Con 2; others, likeRing Fit Adventure, use an accessory that the Joy-Con 2 can’t fit into.
By Nintendo’s count, more than 15,000 third-party games have been released for the Switch. In the company’s testing so far, it has found141 titlesthat don’t boot up at all on the Switch 2, including popular games such asDead by Daylight,Doom Eternal, andFortnite. (Thankfully,Fortniteappeared in the April 2 Nintendo Direct as a Switch 2 launch title, which takes care of that concern.) An additional47 gamesare listed as “playable” with “some in-game compatibility issues”; these includeAlan Wake Remastered,Fall Guys, andStreet Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.
It’s possible that those numbers will go up as Nintendo tests more games, but it’s also likely that some titles will come off these lists as the company works with third parties to address the compatibility issues.
Yup! With a few exceptions, peripherals such as the Switch’s Joy-Cons and Pro Controller will be compatible with the Switch 2. You can checkNintendo’s support sitefor a full list of Switch accessories to see whether the Switch 2 supports them.
As far as the Joy-Cons go, note that because the Switch 2 uses a magnetic hookup for its Joy-Con 2 controllers — rather than the sliding mechanism for the original Switch and its Joy-Cons — it isn’t possible to connect Switch Joy-Cons to the Switch 2; they can only be paired and used wirelessly. (That also means that you won’t be able to charge the Joy-Cons unless you slide them back onto your Switch, or you have a Charging Grip or Charging Stand for that system lying around.)
The Switch Pro Controller can be charged by plugging it into the Switch 2 dock or one of the system’s two USB-C ports, but it must still be paired wirelessly in order to be used. In other words, awired connectionisn’t supported with the Switch 2 as it is with the Switch.
No, unfortunately. While Nintendo made a point of saying in its April 2 Nintendo Direct presentation that the Switch and Switch 2 have the exact same depth — they’re both 13.9 mm (0.55 in) thick — the original Switch’s dock is not compatible with the Switch 2. The issue could come down to physical differences in the bottom edge of the console that prevent it from sitting in the old dock. But it’s more likely that it’s related to the innards of the Switch 2’s dock, which include a fan to keep the tablet cool while it’s running games at resolutions as high as 4K.
The Switch 2 features 256 GB of onboard storage, and it can be expandedonly with microSD Express cards. This is a flash memory standard with significantly faster read and write speeds than the garden-variety microSD cards that the original Switch supports.
You can slot a microSD card from your original Switch into the Switch 2, but all you’ll be able to do with it is view or copy screenshots and videos that you’ve captured in Switch games and saved to the card.

"Something’s up with Kong’s bottom
byMichael McWhertor
Donkey Kong will break new ground in his newSwitch 2game,Donkey Kong Bananza. I mean that literally, in the sense that the 3D action-adventure game is about destruction and digging into the hard earth with DK’s meaty fists. ButBananzawill also push the Donkey Kong series forward by putting pants on Nintendo’s iconic ape. That’s right, Donkey Kong is no longer just weirdly wearing a tie but otherwise completely naked; this Kong wears trousers (and suspenders).
Do we have actor, producer, andceramics enthusiastSeth Rogento thank for this? Maybe.
Rogen, whovoiced Donkey KonginThe Super Mario Bros. Movie, previously said in a behind-the-scenes interview about his role, “It’s a fun character, it’s a fun world. I would be thrilled to see Donkey Kong go on more adventures. Maybe give him some pants this time.”
That movie hasdefinitely had an impact on Donkey Kong’s current design. But it is strange that Donkey Kong, who has famously not worn pants over the course of his career, is now just wearing britches out of nowhere. Other Kongs, like Funky Kong, Tiny Kong, and Lanky Kong, have worn pants, but DK’s immediate family, including Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong, have been content Donald Ducking it for decades. So it clearly isn’t a shame thing.
Only rarely has DK worn anything below the waist, including what I’d consider non-canonical appearances in games likeSkylanders: SuperChargers,where he wore a full outfit. Otherwise, including at events like the Olympics, Kong keeps things banana out. (Of his pockets. Because he has no pants pockets to put bananas in.)
It’s clear fromDonkey Kong Bananzascreenshots that at a certain point in the game, Donkey Kong willacquire(or lose) the pants. So it’s not like Nintendo has suddenly found new modesty regarding DK’s bare bottom, which will be presented with more realistic detail and seen directly from behind inBananza(as opposed to side-on in the Donkey Kong Country games). The game’s trailer also shows many other apes wearing slacks, jeans, and bottoms, so maybe this is a new thing that primates in the Mario universe do.
We’ve asked Nintendo to shed some light on Donkey Kong’s new pants-wearing habit, and will update when the company responds with answers to this mystery.
But we may have to wait until July to fully understand the reasons behind Donkey Kong’s new wardrobe.Donkey Kong Bananzawill be released onNintendo Switch 2on July 17.

"The developers ofAstroneerwere robbed of their trailer debut
byTyler Colp
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Nintendo’s Switch 2 Directstream suffered technical issues at the most inopportune time for the developers ofAstroneer. Near the end of Wednesday’s presentation, a trailer for their new game debuted on the stream during a period where many viewers were stuck looking at a glitchy mess.
“Hey so uh one of the mainNintendo Switch 2 Directstreams completely ate our trailer due to I guess technical difficulties?” System Era Softworks social media manager Lotus Dwyer wrote onBluesky.
The new game is calledStarseeker: Astroneer Expeditions, and if things had gone right, you could’ve recognized the similarities to the studio’s previous game almost immediately. It’s a cooperative game with colorful planets full of weird creatures and plant life. TheBluesky postwith the trailer describes it as a game about “the joy of discovery and the camaraderie that emerges from an evolving, cooperative experience,” which suggests your crew of goofy astronauts will visit many different planets than the one we saw.
Over on theSteam page, the description points out that each planet will have different objectives that can only be completed by using your team’s set of tools. Between missions, you’ll return to “an ever-evolving space station” known as the ESS Starseeker to get upgrades and plan your next expedition.
System Era Softworks saysStarseekertakes place in theAstroneeruniverse, but isn’t a direct sequel.Astroneerwill continue to be updated “for years to come.”

"Why Nintendo wants Madden and Borderlands on its new handheld
byChris Plante
Nintendo took an unusual approach to the past two decades of video game console wars. It stayed out of them. But with today’sNintendo Switch 2 info dump— packed with big-name third-party games rarely seen onNintendo hardware— the House that Mario Built appears ready to rejoin the fray. Why now? Credit a collision of confidence, opportunity, and necessity.
Sony and Microsoft have spent generations bloodying each other in a battle for the most extravagant visuals, courting favor with major publishers like Activision and Electronic Arts. Meanwhile, Nintendo swam in the opposite direction, favoring cheaper, less powerful machines that prioritized toy-like novelty over raw specs.
The historic successes of both the Wii and the Switch obscure how risky this gamble has been. The slower hardware — with a few, better-forgotten exceptions — couldn’t run the latest entries in gaming’s most popular franchises, including Madden, Call of Duty, and Grand Theft Auto. Survival hinged on Nintendo’s ability to produce multiple exclusive hits each year, with smaller indie titles filling the gaps.
With the Switch, everything went Nintendo’s way — by both design and good fortune. The publisher assembled arguably the greatest first-party lineup in history. Indie development exploded. And a new wave of beloved IP —Minecraft,Fortnite, Roblox — designed for smartphone-level specs meant that Nintendo’s hardware, unintentionally, could play some of the biggest games on the planet.
And yet, today, Nintendo’s hourlongSwitch 2reveal stream featured anabundance of titlesonce rare on its systems. 2K Games showed off new entries in the WWE, Civilization, and Borderlands franchises. Other developers, like IO Interactive, pledged to bring hits once best experienced on Xbox or PlayStation, like Hitman and the upcomingProject 007. Square Enix showed theremakes ofFinal Fantasy 7, and EA appeared, committing EA Sports FC and Madden to the platform.
It’s possible that coming off the success of the Switch — a far cry from Nintendo’s grim posture after the Wii U — the gamemaker feels positioned to push into the third-party territory ceded to Sony and Microsoft, the latter of which seems to be clinging to its hardware business by its fingertips. After all, Nintendo has sold over 150 million Switch consoles — more than the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S combined.
It’s also possible a mix of luck and industry trends will once again favor Nintendo. Sony and Microsoft’s reluctance to fully leave the PS4 and Xbox One era behind — coupled with a generation raised on mobile gaming — has trained AAA developers to build for underpowered hardware. TheSwitch 2will still trail behind top-tier machines in horsepower, but that may no longer matter. Most major franchises simply don’t demand cutting-edge specs.
Both of those are likely a piece of the puzzle. But I believe Nintendo’s decision to release amore expensiveand slightly morepowerful devicemay have less to do with past console wars and more to do with its biggest threat in the present. In 2025, Valve’s Steam Deck does what the Switch doesn’t: It lets players enjoy most AAA games anytime, anywhere — and offers many of the same indie titles at steep discounts. (That it also runs emulated games from every Nintendo console ever released surely isn’t lost on the company either, as it continues its crackdown on third-party emulation.)
If Nintendo once again ignores third parties and their graphical needs, it would find itself competing against a growing number of handhelds that offer more power and more games, often with better specs — albeit higher prices.
Inexplicably, Microsoft and Sony burned an entire hardware cycle without answering the Switch’s key selling point: portability. It took a PC gaming marketplace — with almost no hardware pedigree — to offer legitimate competition. And Nintendo, with the Switch 2’s higher price, greater power, and suite of PC-like social features, seems to be taking the threat seriously.
Yes, Nintendo has reentered the modern console wars. Maybe, one day, Sony and Microsoft will too.

"Nintendo’s new Mario Kart is pricey
byMichael McWhertor
We knew there was a new Mario Kart coming to Switch 2, but we didn’t expect it to cost this much. After showing off the open-world racing gameMario Kart Worldon Wednesday during itsSwitch 2 Nintendo Directshowcase, Nintendo revealed that the game will have a $79.99 price tag. That’s new territory for Nintendo, which just two years ago made headlines bycharging $69.99forThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
ButMario Kart World’s high asking price doesn’t appear to be the standard for Switch 2 software. Nintendo also confirmed Wednesday thatDonkey Kong Bananza, coming to Switch 2 in July, will cost $69.99. Still, these are indicators that Nintendo is comfortable charging more not just for the Switch successor, but for its next-gen games too.
Those prices may only represent the digital versions of those Switch 2 games. Pricing announced in some territories shows that Nintendo plans to charge even more for the physical editions of games likeMario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananza.
Nintendo has not announced prices for other games or the Switch 2 upgrade packs that were revealed as part of Wednesday’s Nintendo Direct, though it did put a price on another Switch 2 launch game,Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, if only in Japan. That virtual exploration of the Switch 2 hardware will cost 990 yen for a digital copy, which will probably translate to a sub-$10 price in the U.S.
Price increases on software aren’t uncommon during next-generation console transitions. When the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 launched, standard game pricing jumped from $49.99 to $59.99, a price point that held steady for more than a decade. In 2020, alongside the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, prices crept up further, with some publishers charging $69.99 for certain games. Nintendo itself caught up with that trend withTears of the Kingdom,following Microsoft’s lead, with its first $69.99 game.
Despite the reality of inflation, the increasing cost of game development, and the value often associated with live-service games like Mario Kart, reaction to pricing for Switch 2 games has beenwidely negative. Combined with thehigh price of the Switch 2itself, Nintendo may have a harder time reaching the success of the original Switch than some expected.

"You and everyone else will be trying to get one, but these tips will boost your chances
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
The Nintendo Switch 2 is launching onJune 5. Pre-orders were initially going live on Wednesday,April 9, but those plans have been postponed due toNintendo assessing the “potential impact of tariffs.” A new pre-order date will be shared at a later time.
The original article follows below.
While I wish to exist in a world where you could easily click “buy” and be guaranteed a console come launch day, it’s not so simple in reality. Hundreds of thousands of people, if not more, are going to be showing up simultaneously, putting a strain on both servers and allocated pre-order stock. In other words, you’ll be lucky to score a pre-order reservation.
That said, there are ways you can prepare yourself for whenever the Switch 2 goes up for pre-order in the hopes of boosting your chance of success. You can sign up to be among the first to know when retailers go live with pre-orders — and, if you’re a longtime Nintendo Switch player, you might be eligible to skip the usual online retailer rush.
Starting with Nintendo,the company is accepting sign-upsfor those hoping to reserve a Switch 2, but there are multiple requirements in place, likely to quash the number of consoles resellers can get their hands on. To express interest in pre-ordering a Switch 2 from Nintendo, you must do the following by April 2:
Only if you meet that criteria can you submit the form to express interest in reserving. That said, there’s no guarantee that you’ll be chosen to receive an invite. But if you are chosen, you’ll get an email from Nintendo on or after May 8 to purchase either the $449.99 model, or the $499.99 model that includesMario Kart World. If you receive an invitation, you’ll have 72 hours to follow through with a purchase.
Whether you qualify for Nintendo’s strict pre-order process or not, it’s a good idea to sign up for email notifications at Best Buythrough this page. Doing so will ensure that you get an email with a specific pre-order time for the Switch 2. Additionally, it’ll loop you into a newsletter that’s only about the Switch 2,its games, and related content (you won’t receive other Best Buy newsletters).
GameStop has aproduct page up for the Switch 2, and you’ll want to enter your email address to receive communications about the specific pre-order details.
Additionally, if you plan to pre-order at GameStop, you should know that it’srunning a promotion beginning April 9that lets customers get up to $175 trade-in credit for their Switch consoles when reserving a Switch 2. The amount of trade-in credit you’ll get depends on the model you’re trading in, as well as its condition and whether you have all of the components.

"A way to save on Nintendo’s new console
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
TheNintendo Switch 2will cost $449.99, and will beavailable to pre-order April 9. The closest thing to a discount on it comes fromGameStop, which is offering slightly boosted trade-in value for your old Switch starting the day that pre-orders begin. You’ll only get the following trade-in credit if you’re reserving a Switch 2. Although, if you reserve a Switch 2 from GameStop and later realize you want to trade in your Switch, you’ll be able to modify your reservation with a boosted trade-in through April 30.
Your Switch OLED will knock $175 off the cost of the Switch 2. Outside of this promo, GameStop’s offer for OLEDs sits at $143, which is less than half of the console’s original cost. If you have the standard Switch with removable Joy-Con (be it the launch edition or the revised model with better battery life), you’ll get $125 in credit, up from $110, a measly third of its original price. As for the Switch Lite, you’ll get an even $100 in credit, up from $71.50. If you’re a GameStop Pro member, you’ll get an extra 10% added to the trade-in credit.
In order to get these trade-in valuations, your hardware needs to be in “good condition” and come with all “necessary” components, which I’m guessing means what normally comes with each console when you first opened the box.

"It’s-a me, economic anxiety over inflation and US tariffs
byChristopher Grant
January’s Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event took the wraps off the console, but left a lot of details unanswereduntil now. After the initial reveal, I put togetheran analysis of the possible pricingfor the console, using Nintendo’s own historical pricing strategies to guide my thinking. My conclusion then was that it would cost $399.
I…was wrong. The Nintendo Switch 2 will debut in Junestarting at $449.99, with a $499.99 version that includesMario Kart World.
At that price, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be the most expensive console Nintendo has ever released, by some margin. And even adjusted for inflation, and when considering the various bundle packages of previous Nintendo consoles, the Nintendo Switch 2 will still be the most expensive Nintendo console ever made!
It’s not quite June yet, so I can’t update this chart to reflect the inflation-adjusted price to the same date of the Switch 2 launch, but the prices from February of this year are pretty illustrative of the change here.
[Ed. note:An earlier version of this list didn’t include information on pack-in games included in some console releases, and didn’t include the various NES bundles and prices. Adjusted for inflation, only the very first NES release — a tricked-out bundle originally limited to test markets only — would be more expensive than the Nintendo Switch 2. Once you compare it to the more widely released Control Deck release just a few months later, the relative cost of the Nintendo Switch 2 is clear.]
But it wasn’t just me that was wrong! Nearly 57% of ourpoll respondents agreedwith my predicted $399 price, and just 9% thought it would come in at $449. (If that was you, congratulations!) Is that indicative that Nintendo will have a hard time moving units at $449, or simply that people didn’t think Nintendo would go that high? It’s too early to say.
Earlier reporting from Bloomberg, citing multiple industry analysts, pegged the pricebetween $399 and $499, so… nailed it?
On price, the analysts Bloomberg spoke to are unanimous in expecting the Switch 2 to cost at least $399 — which, again, agrees with Polygon’s own analysis. Some think it could go higher, to $449 or even $499, driven by the cost of components and fears over the impact of U.S. tariffs. At $499 it would be the same price as a PlayStation 5 (and $50 more than a digital-only model).
Here again is a list of all of the current-gen consoles, now including the Switch 2 and its confirmed pricing:
At $449, the Switch 2 will go toe to toe on pricing with the all-digital variants of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, which is in keeping with the Switch’s 2017 launch price that matched the $299 being asked for the PS4 Slim and Xbox One S. It’s worth noting, however, that $299 in 2017 dollars still comes in under $400 in today’s bucks, when adjusted for inflation. It’s not just you — everything really is just more expensive!
One last consideration: While the Switch 2’s specs actually put it a notch above the Steam Deck in some key categories, like resolution and including a 4K-compatible dock out of the box, I didn’t expect Valve’s portable gaming PC to beat Nintendo on pricing. The Steam Deck APU is going on three years old at this point, and a little long in the tooth, but it’s hard to argue against the value embedded in Valve’s storefront. (I boughtUndertalefor $1 recently just to have another copy.) So with Valve continuing to make a name for itself, and with Microsoftreportedly entering the portable gaming spacethis year in partnership with Asus, Nintendo no longer has the exclusive lock on the portable gaming market.
Update: I updated the headline and some of the opening paragraphs, along with the first pricing comparison chart, to reflect that when evaluated on a more like-to-like basis the Nintendo Switch 2, with and without a pack-in game, is in fact the most expensive Nintendo console ever released, when adjusted for inflation.

"But maybe we’re just seeing what we want to see
byIan Walker
Duringtoday’s Switch 2 breakdown, Nintendo showed off an exclusive FromSoftware game for the upcoming console calledThe Duskbloods, which despiteits online multiplayer focuslooks kind of like aBloodbornesequel in everything but name.
The Duskbloodsreveal opens with a man taking a nap in an ornate chair. A woman, who appears to be lying on the floor so as to avoid the moonlight streaming through a nearby window, grabs his hand and seemingly leaves behind a circular brand. In true FromSoft fashion, she imparts cryptic dialogue through it all, telling some unseen presence, “I give you my blood. I give you my life. Turn a wheel and transport him to a night of moonlight, to humanity’s very dusk.”
What follows is a smattering of cutscenes and gameplay showcasing a semi-Gothic world that at points looks like a mashup ofBloodborneandElden Ringas well as something completely new and steampunk-y. A futuristic train zooms through a grimy industrial district. A heroic figure, clad head to toe in clunky, Iron Man-like armor, jetpacks from a cliffside and flies above a very Victorian-era skyline. A broken, metallic man hovers dramatically in a cathedral with what looks like a rifle slung across his back.
Some of these aesthetics fly in the face of what one might expect from aBloodbornesequel, sure, but it still feels like the FromSoft team wants us to viewThe Duskbloodsas a spiritual successor.Bloodbornetold a deeply symbolic story about humanity’s connections to blood and the moon, specifically its mythical ties to reproduction. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that our first look atThe Duskbloodsmakes frequent allusions to similar motifs, even if the game ultimately has nothing to do withBloodborne.
Small details support this hypothesis as well.Bloodborneis the only game in the Soulsborne pseudo-genre to feature guns, and several firearms feature prominently inThe Duskbloods. Theofficial FromSoft websitementionsThe Duskbloodsplayers throwing themselves into “a violent fray for ‘First Blood’,” which sounds an awful lot likeBloodborne’s elder god-linked Old Blood. And this may be a stretch, but a man near the end ofThe Duskbloodstrailer strikes a pose (see the top of this blog post) similar toBloodborne’s iconic Make Contact gesture.
It’s easy to understand why folks want to seeBloodborneinThe Duskbloods. Developed for PlayStation 4 in cooperation with Sony’s Japan Studio (rest in peace),Bloodbornehas been locked to a single platform since its 2015 launch. Fans are hungry for any acknowledgement of its existence, and they’ll eagerly tune into every major gaming event hoping forBloodborneto make an appearance.
It’s a shameThe Duskbloodsmay be resigned to the same fate due to its Switch 2 exclusivity, but its existence may be a clue as to what’s going on withBloodbornebehind the scenes. Sony owns that property, so any futureBloodborneproject would need its approval even if FromSoftware’s developers were to develop a remaster or even a follow-up. It’s possibleThe Duskbloodsis FromSoft’s way of finally giving folks what they want without the hassle of getting Sony’s okay.
The Duskbloodslaunches on the Switch 2 in 2026.

"Ain’t no rule says a cow can’t play Mario Kart
byMichael McWhertor
Switch 2 launch titleMario Kart Worldwill feature 24-player races for the first time in series history. That bigger player count therefore warrants an expanded roster of racers, which means Nintendo is now forced to let anyone and anything from the Mario series get behind the wheel. From Moo Moos to Fish Bones (you know, the animated bones of dead Cheep Cheeps), no restrictions will be placed on who is licensed to drive in the sequel toMario Kart 8 Deluxe.
Yes, the classic lineup of racers will be present inMario Kart World. Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Toad, and Toadette — they’re all here as part of the roster. But so are the dolphins and penguins from the world of Super Mario, which are known as Dolphins and Penguins, respectively. Piantas fromSuper Mario Sunshineare playable, as are Para-Biddybuds fromSuper Mario 3D Land, Snowmen fromSuper Mario 64, and Sidesteppers fromMario Bros.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxehad a whopping 48 playable characters — including the game’s DLC, but not including variants — andMario Kart Worldlooks like it might rival or eventually beat that, based on the huge number of characters Nintendo has already shown (more than 40!). We’ll likely get more details on who’s capable of riding a kart, motorcycle, plane, and snowmobile — even if they don’t have arms and legs — during a dedicated Nintendo Direct forMario Kart World, which is coming on April 17.
For now, here’s who we can expect on theMario Kart Worldroster, based on the game’s debut trailer. (Confirmed playable characters are listed first in bold.)
Mario Kart Worldwill be released on June 5, the same day Nintendo Switch 2 launches.

"Nintendo’s official peripheral is $49.99
byCameron Faulkner

The Nintendo Switch didn’t make it easy to let you connect with friends and strangers over the internet. TheSwitch 2, on the other hand, is fully embracing connectivity. To that end, a stand-up camera will be launched alongside the Switch 2 onJune 5that can be used with its GameChat feature.
GameChat functionality varies on a per-game basis, butNintendo’s Switch 2 Directshowcase showed it putting faces within the Switch 2 Edition ofSuper Mario Party Jamboree, letting gamers overlay their faces on their game screens.
The official Switch 2 Camera is $49.99 (and isdetailed here), and it plugs into the Switch 2’s USB-C port. You can use it when the console is docked to your TV, or when you’re holding it in your hands. The camera specializes in capturing a wide angle shot, and Nintendo claims that its high-sensitivity image can adjust brightness. There’s also a physical privacy shutter that can be activated when you don’t want the camera to look at you.
If you don’t want to buy Nintendo’s camera, you might have luck plugging in one you already own — assuming it plugs in via USB-C — as Nintendo confirmed USC-C support for third-party cameras. It’s likely there will be some restrictions and limitations, but before you buy a new camera, try plugging in your own, either directly or, if needed, with a USB-A to USB-C adapter. In the Switch 2’s software, there will be a “Test USB Camera” feature to check compatibility with the console.

When Nintendo formally unveiled the long-rumored Switch 2 in January, there was very little idea of what to expect at launch. Now that the June 5Switch 2 release dateis on the horizon, we have a fuller idea of what’s coming to the console on day one.
Yes, there’s a new Mario Kart calledMario Kart World, but there’s also sort-of-tech-demoNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tourfrom Nintendo, and a number of significant third-party ports making their Nintendo debuts — includingStreet Fighter 6,Cyberpunk 2077, andSplit Fiction.
If none of that takes your fancy, remember backward compatibility supports your original Switch library, while a number of Switch 1 games, includingboth Switch 1 Zelda games, will also get dedicated “Nintendo Switch 2 Editions” with visual upgrades. We’ve included these editions as part of the line-up below.
Here’s a list ofall Switch 2 games confirmed for launch, including ports and Switch 2 Edition upgrades (but not all backward compatible games):
As well as the above, there arethree GameCube gamesavailable at alaunch to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers only playable on Switch 2:The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, Soulcalibur 2,andF-Zero GX.
For more Switch 2 coverage, here’s a roundup ofeverything announced at the Switch 2 Direct, a list ofall Switch 2 gamesconfirmed so far (beyond just launch), and details about theSwitch 2 pro controllerandGameSharefeature.

We have a full view ofNintendo Switch 2 gamesnow theApril 2 Directhas come and gone — including a number of exclusives andlaunch titles, and that all-importantrelease datefor the console itself.
It follows months of slim pickings following the console’s initial hardware-focused reveal in January, which also saw developers and publishers holding fire of their involvement until now.
The following Switch 2 games list explains the exclusives, third-party games, and confirmed developers and publishers for the console from the launch and beyond.
Update (April 8):Added two new games —Mouse Workand a Switch 2 version of the recentSuikoden I&II HDremaster.
First, let’s look at the exclusive games coming to the Switch 2, whether that’s from Nintendo itself or from third-parties:
As well as the above full exclusives, there’s a series of“Nintendo Switch 2 Edition”titles, which are Switch 1 games “patched” to make the most out of the Switch 2 hardware (and is different tobackward compatibility). These are available as both “upgrade packs” if you own the Switch 1 version, or as standalone editions for the Switch 2:
Elsewhere, those with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription will get the following“GameCube Classics”from launch day:
As well as the above list of exclusives and Switch 2-specific editions of Switch 1 games, here’s a breakdown of other games confirmed for the Switch 2 from third-parties that are either already on other systems, or are debuting on multiple platforms:

"﻿The creators of Elden Ring are making a game for the Switch 2
byAna Diaz
FromSoftware, the renowned development studio behind popular games likeElden Ringand the Dark Souls series, announced a brand new game at theNintendo Directon Wednesday. It’s calledThe Duskbloodsand it’s set to be released sometime in 2026, exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2.
The Duskbloodsis an online multiplayer game that supports up to eight players, per thegame’s official website.
The developers aired a short trailer that showed off some of the world and general concepts behind the game. It’s dripping in dark, gothic vibes and the opening intro references an unknown knight of “light.” The game appears to feature a completely original concept with a new world and cast of characters (one of which looks like it preys on a monster like a vampire). That said, the title of the game has many wondering if it’s set in theBloodborneuniverse.
The news comes just after FromSoftware made another big announcement at the Nintendo Switch 2 event. Its global hit,Elden Ring, will be getting a Switch 2 port so even more people will be able to take up the journey and fight as The Tarnished. (TheElden Ring Tarnished Editionport will be released in 2025).
As for non-Switch 2 news, FromSoftware still has some other projects cooking. The studio’s next big game,Elden Ring Nightreign, is set to be released on May 30. There was no mention ofNightreignat the Direct and as of writing, thefast-paced, co-op spinoffwill be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.
For those who want to learn more, game director Hidetaka Miyazaki will share more aboutThe Duskbloodsin a developer diary series called Creator’s Voice on Friday.

"Donkey Kong Bananza is out this summer
byMichael McWhertor
A big new Donkey Kong 3D platforming adventure is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo announced Wednesday during itsNintendo Directshowcase dedicated to the new console. It’s calledDonkey Kong Bananza, and it will send (fresh new look) Donkey Kong to heretofore unexplored, underground territories where he’ll smash, grab, and throw things at anyone who stands in his way.
Donkey Kong Bananzawill be released on July 17, about six weeks after theNintendo Switch 2 launchesin June, and it’ll cost $69.99.
WhileDonkey Kong Bananzalooks to be primarily a 3D adventure, a trailer for the Switch 2 game reveals it will apparently have some side-scrolling elements too, in the style of the Donkey Kong Country games.Donkey Kong Bananzawill be DK’s first fully 3D adventure sinceDonkey Kong 64; subsequent games have largely focused on classic side-scrolling action.

"“Tomorrow” is June 5, 2025

If it’s felt like roughly 3-1/2 years since the last installment of Toby Fox’sDeltarune, the wildly popular follow-up to his wildly popular debut gameUndertale, that’s because you have a very good sense of time, congratulations. But after what has been an interminable wait — just scan the official subreddit if you don’t believe me — the next installment, comprised of Chapters 3 and 4, will make its debut alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, 2025, for $24.99.
The first chapter ofDeltarunedebuted in October 2018 as a free download, with the second chapter coming in September 2021, also for free. Fox has said subsequent chapters would not be free, and he’d release more at once … the question then, has been, when? TheDeltarunefan community has met this wait with in-jokes, poring over every missive from Fox to glean clues for a release date, often settling on “tomorrow” as the obvious answer. While not quite “tomorrow,” June 5 feels like an acceptable compromise.
“Deltarune Chapters 1-4 will be released on June 5th as a launch title for Nintendo Switch 2,” Foxposted on Bluesky. “It’s also coming to Steam, Switch, PS4 and PS5 the same day!” This of course leaves off any Xbox platforms which, considering the first two chapters never made an appearance there, stands to reason. Steam users canadd the game to their wishlistnow, if that’s your kind of thing.
In an newsletter Fox revealed the asking price and noted that he feels the price is comped to just these four chapters of Deltarune. “You only have to buy the game once - upcoming Chapters will be added as free updates,” he writes. “That’s not factored into the cost, though. I only feel right charging for what there currently is, not what I say there will be.”
And that’s it for clues as to when the remaining three planned chapters will be released! But let’s not be greedy, a release date and price is enough to chew on for now. For everything else announced at today’s Nintendo Switch 2 event,see here.

"The $449.99 console will miss its intended pre-order date due to the ‘potential impact of tariffs’
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Following the new tariffs instated by the Trump administration, the originalApril 9 pre-order date for the Nintendo Switch 2 has been postponed. The new pre-order day hasn’t been set, and will be shared by Nintendo at a later date. ItsJune 5 release dateis unchanged.
The original article follows below.
While it’s possible that Nintendo has done everything in its power to ensure that it can meet demand, it seems likely still that Switch 2 pre-orders may be tough to secure ahead of its launch. We’ll have more details when Nintendo shares them on the big day.
Fortunately, paid Switch Online subscribers who, as of April 2, have purchased a minimum of 12 months of the service and have 50 total gameplay hours will get priority access to a batch of pre-orders directly through Nintendo. While you won’t get a loyalty discount, your loyalty has been rewarded with an opportunity to score a console on launch day. You can register your interest in getting a console through theMy Nintendo Store sign-up page, and the first batch of invites will go out on May 8 (look for an email fromno-reply@noa.nintendo.com). If you get an invite, you’ll have 72 hours (three days) to buy before the opportunity passes you by.
TheNintendo Switch 2will come with 256 GB of internal storage, and will cost $449.99. A version of the console that includesMario Kart Worldwill cost $499.99. As for expandable storage to fit more games, it’ll utilizemicroSD Express cards, which have the same form factor as the original Switch’s microSD cards, but are as fast as SSDs. Those start at around $45 for a 128 GB model, or $60 for a 256 GB version. While theSwitch 2 will be backwards compatiblewith most Switch games, you’ll need a microSD Express card to play any type of game on the Switch 2.

"22 years later, Nintendo is giving us the goods
byJulia Lee
At long last, it’s finally happened.Kirby Air Rideis getting a sequel:Kirby Air Ridersfor theNintendo Switch 2later this year.
We don’t know much about the game yet, but seeing the newly refreshed graphics is enough. The game is being directed by the man, the myth, the legend himself, Masahiro Sakurai, who also directed the original game (and is, y’know, Kirby’s original creator). Notably, this was the last Kirby game Sakurai directed, moving on to direct the Super Smash Bros. series starting withBrawlin 2008.
If you’re not hip to one of the best multiplayer games for the GameCube, let me break it down for you.Kirby Air Rideis a fast-paced racing game where you don’t press any button to accelerate — your warp stars and rides are running fast and hot on their own. You are controlling which directions the rides are going, and pivotal to any Kirby game, you can suck up enemies to copy their abilities and take out your allies. There’s beautiful winding paths, great music, and just overall great vibes.
But the meat ofKirby Air Ridethat set it apart from other racing games was its “City Trial” game mode, where you would be plunked down against three others in a huge city map, and you’ll have five minutes to collect as many power-ups as you can — and if you’re lucky, find the three parts of a legendary air ride machine. After those five minutes of chaos are up, there’ll be a match of some kind, whether it’s a race, a duel, a contest to see who can take out the most enemies, etc. Whoever wins that, wins the game! That being said, you don’t really know which mini-game will appear at the end, so your investment into a ride that can glide infinitely may be wasted when it turns out you have to fight King Dedede.
That being said, the new look forKirby Air Ridersdidn’t show off any new version of City Trial, but it’ll likely live on in the new title, as it’d be criminal to launch this game without it.

"Freed from the constraints of the original Switch, publishers are making up for lost time
byOli Welsh
Big publishers who haven’t been able to bring their biggest multiplatform games to the Nintendo Switch due to its relative lack of processing power are racing to release ports of these titles on the more powerful Switch 2. We got our first indication of this during Wednesday’sSwitch 2 Direct, with the announcement of Switch 2 versions ofElden Ring,Split Fiction,EA Sports FCandMadden NFL,Hogwarts Legacy,Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3+4,Hitman World of Assassination(plus developer IO Interactive’s forthcoming James Bond game),Yakuza 0,Borderlands 4,Street Fighter 6,Civilization 7,Cyberpunk 2077,WWEandNBA 2K,Final Fantasy 7 Remake.
Cyberpunk 2077will be available from day one, June 5, as Switch 2 launch games. So willStreet Fighter 6,Civilization 7,Hitman,Hogwarts Legacy,Yakuza 0, andSplit Fiction, and several other third-party games.Final Fantasy 7 Remakeis currently in development and will head to Switch 2 at a later date.Indie developers are also getting involved:Hades 2,Silksong, andDeltarunechapters 3 and 4 will be coming to Switch 2, among many others.
The show of third-party support for the Switch 2 during the Direct is likely just the tip of the iceberg; Nintendo hasreportedly been very selectiveabout the partners it has been willing to share Switch 2 developer kits with up to this point. At the moment, it seems to be big publishers like Square Enix, EA, and Capcom who’ve been given access, along with select major independent studios.
Nevertheless, it’s a marked shift in tone from the launch of the Switch, when third-parties, wary of Nintendo after the failure of the Wii U, were slow to get on board. By the time they did, they only had a narrow window to release ports likeDoomandThe Witcher 3before the gap between the handhelds’ capabilities and the power requirements of modern AAA games became too large to bridge.
The Switch 2 has now narrowed that gap, and this time publishers are keen to get involved from day one. Perhaps it was the 150-million-plus sales of the Switch that persuaded them?

We’ve been fascinated bythe Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con’s mouse functionalityever since it was teased during the very first Switch 2 reveal, by way of aJoy-Con gliding aroundon a featureless black surface.
At Wednesday’sSwitch 2 Nintendo Direct, we finally got more details about how the Joy-Con mouse works, and more importantly, the games that are going to make use of this feature.
Multiple Switch 2 games will be implementing the mouse. Here’s a list of all the games that will be enjoying some newfound mouse support:
In the case ofMario Party Jamboree, the mouse won’t work on the original Switch version. And if you own the original Switch 1 version of the game, you’ll need to buy an “upgrade pack” to get the game on your Switch 2. That version of the game will also make use of the chat and webcam features (courtesy ofthe Switch 2’s new C button).

"See Hyrule the way it was meant to be seen

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomfans will be able to see the era-defining Nintendo titles in a new light on Nintendo Switch 2 with a duo of enhanced visual upgrades, Nintendo announced Wednesday during itsNintendo Direct presentation about the new console. If you already own the games, you won’t automatically have the Switch 2 version and will need to purchase an upgrade pack to get it. However, Switch Online subscribers who have the Expansion Pack tier and own copies of these games will get the upgrades for no additional cost, according toNintendo.
The Switch 2 version of each game will include a “Zelda Notes” feature, which will provide game tips to players; you can use this Switch 2-only feature via the Nintendo Switch app on smart devices. It can help you find Korok seeds, for example. That’s in addition to enhanced resolution and frame rates and HDR support.
Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomhave earned their place among the greatest video games of all time, and delivered on the promise of a truly open-world Zelda game where you could see a mountain in the distance and then go climb it. Both games managed this feat on the Switch, which, as a device designed for both big-screen and handheld play, was significantly underpowered compared to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (and later, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X).
Of course, this experience wasn’t without its compromises; at launch forBreath of the Wild, certain areas of the world exhibitednotable performance problems, especially when played in the Switch’s docked mode. Less than a month later,Nintendo issued a patch that made significant improvementsbut didn’t completely alleviate frame-rate drops below 30 frames per second.
Now, the Switch 2’s beefed-up hardware will be able to renderBreath of the Wild’s version of Hyrule with a much fuller degree of fidelity and fluidity.
Update: Added that Switch Online subscribers with the Expansion Pack tier get both Switch 2 Edition versions ofBreath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomfor no added cost if you own them already.

"This is the new 1-2-Switch… kinda
byOli Welsh
Nintendo loves to create games that show off the unique features of its consoles, likeWii Sports,Nintendo Land, and1-2-Switch. TheNintendo Switch 2version of this will be the rather functionally namedNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, in which your tiny avatar will run around on a giant Switch 2 console and explore its features and secrets through the medium of minigames and tech demos.
It looks like the sort of game that might come installed on the console for free, butNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tourwill be a paid, digital-only game. Perhaps that indicates that it’s a bit more substantial and fun than you might expect. It will be available at the console’s launch.
One of the minigames featured is a top-down golf putting game that uses the Joy-Con 2’s mouse and gyroscope sensors so you can push the Joy-Con around on a surface like it’s the head of your golf club. Another seemed to relate to the console’s 3D audio capabilities. Elsewhere, as your avatar explores the Switch 2, clicking on question marks will explain facts about the console, like how the Joy-Con 2’s magnetic attachment works.
Update (April 7):In aninterview with The Verge, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser confirmed thatNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tourwill cost $9.99. Defending the decision to charge for the game, he said, “As this game was being developed, what’s been packed into it is a depth of minigame experiences. They’re very deep, they’re very repeatable. And so, as we looked at that depth of play experience and opportunity, we felt that $9.99 was a fair price to ask for that.”

"So which friend will be the one who buys all the multiplayer games?
byJulia Lee
Even if you only own one copy of a game, you and your friends can all get in on the fun together using GameShare, which was shown as part of the April 2Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.
This appears to run similarly to the “Download Play” option for the Nintendo DS. For example, one person may own a copy ofBig Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain, but using the new GameShare option, your friends can jump in and join you to play, even if they don’t own it.
This feature will only work with select games, but the stream did show off a few confirmed titles — includingSuper Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury,Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker,Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics,Super Mario Odyssey, and the aforementionedBig Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain.
The stream also noted that there will be Nintendo Switch 2 games that use this feature, though none were announced yet.
The GameShare feature makes sense, as Nintendo recently also announced the ability to loan your buddies your games usingVirtual Game Cards. In an era of shared Netflix passwords and Steam Family groups, Nintendo understands that not everyone can afford to buy every great title on the market — and that’s what I appreciates about them.

"No USB headset necessary. Just grab a pair of wired headphones
byCameron Faulkner
Nintendo is launching a new version of its beloved Switch Pro controller alongside theSwitch 2. In addition to some welcome upgrades — namely its Chat button that pulls up the GameChat feature — there’s one new feature that’s easy to overlook. That’s because other consoles have supported it for the better part of a decade: wireless audio passthrough. The $79.99 Switch 2 Pro controller has a 3.5mm headphone jack positioned under its D-pad and right analog stick. We’ve waited eight years for this!
While the Switch 2 Pro controller likely won’t launch until June 5 (the same day as the Switch 2 itself) and a price wasn’t confirmed, we’re keeping an eye on when it’ll be available to pre-order. Unless Nintendo is keen on opening the door for more controller manufacturers, this controller likely retains all of the same specialized hardware features that distinguished its predecessor from third-party options, including HD rumble, NFC support for amiibo figures and cards, gyroscopic aiming in games that support it, plus the ability to remotely wake up the Switch from sleep mode.
It remains to be seen as to whether it’s backwards compatible with the original Switch, what kind of fun messagemay be printed on the controller PCB, and whether it uses the sameCTR-003 rechargeable battery, which was originally built into the Nintendo 3DS.

Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on Thursday, June 5, Nintendo announced Wednesday during itsNintendo Directshowcase dedicated to the new console.
Nintendo will have two options available at launch: a base version that includes the Switch 2 console for $449.99, and a bundled version that includes a digital copy ofMario Kart Worldfor $499.99.Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2will start on April 9.

A handful of games from Nintendo will be available at launch, includingMario Kart World,Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, and upgraded Nintendo Switch 2 Edition versions ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
The launch of Switch 2 will arrive more than eight years after the original Switch, which Nintendo released in March 2017 for $299. At $449.99, the Switch 2 will be Nintendo’s most expensive console at launch, not accounting for inflation. Currently, Nintendo sells three models of the original Switch, ranging from $199.99 for the Switch Lite to $349.99 for the Switch OLED Model.

"Still just as small, but this microSD type has SSD speeds
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
We’ve suspected that theNintendo Switch 2will use microSD cards, just like the original Switch, for the purpose of storing more games than can fit on its internal storage. But Nintendo shared during its Direct showcase that the Switch 2 supports microSD Express cards, which retain the same size and shape of microSD cards, but boastgreatlyenhanced read and write speeds.
Will you need one when the Switch 2 launches on June 5? Yes, as regular microSD cards will not work in the new console for the purpose of playing games. However, you can insert one to look at screenshots and videos that were captured on your original Switch, perNintendo’s support article. The good news if you buy a microSD Express card? They’re backwards compatible with all supported original Switch games. The not-so-good news? They’re kind of expensive.
Compared to the tremendous value of buying a high-capacity microSD card, where $75 or so can get you 1 TB, microSD Express cards aremuchmore expensive at the moment. That’s partially because only a couple of companies manufacture microSD Express cards. Plus, while the tech is a handful of years old, the Switch 2 is the first mainstream gaming device to support it.
As mentioned above, there’s a good reason for the price increase: these cards are classified as NVMe SSDs. To that end, they can read and write data about four times faster than your run-of-the-mill microSD card, resulting in faster everything, from downloads, updates, and loading. It’s likely system boot times will be faster, too.
Correction: A previous version of this story indicated that microSD cards aren’t compatible with the Switch 2 at all. They are supported in a limited fashion when inserted into the Switch 2. Users can only look at screenshots and videos, not access games or saves.

"The biggest mystery of our era finally explained
byIan Walker
After months of speculation, we now know what happens when you press the Switch 2’s mysterious C button thanks totoday’s Nintendo Direct presentation.
The C button is all about GameChat, a new Switch 2 feature that looks a lot like Discord video chat. It allows you to communicate with friends in both handheld and docked modes using a microphone built into the gamepad as well as share your screen.
GameChat even works between people playing different games. Nintendo has also included built-in parental controls that will make it necessary for kids to get permission to use these features.
Switch 2 will also launch with a camera that puts you on screen, either overlaid on top of the gameplay or by yourself.
Nintendo Switch Online will be required to use GameChat, but the feature will be available without a membership through March 31, 2026.
The C buttonfirst appearedas a new, unmarked Joy-Con button during the Switch 2 revealback in January. Speculation as to its purposebegan immediately. Most thought about functionality first, guessing it might be for sharing screenshots or launchinga Miiverse-style social media hub, but others went a more silly route by envisioning the button as summoning the late, great Peter Falk as Lieutenant Frank Columbo or making a funny noise and nothing else. I’ll leave you all to argue whether Wednesday’s reveal is better or worse than those guesses.

"Nintendo follows up its biggest hit ever with a Switch 2 launch title
byOli Welsh
As suggested by theinitial Switch 2 reveal, the big launch game for Nintendo’s new system will be an all-new Mario Kart. It’s calledMario Kart Worldand will launch alongside the console on June 5, Nintendo revealed duringWednesday’s Switch 2 Direct. The game has a $79.99 price tag, although you can getMario Kart Worldfor less if you pre-order it as part of aSwitch 2 bundle priced at $499.99.
Mario Kart Worldis an open-world racing game in the style of Forza Horizon, in which fields of 24 racers compete across a huge map with different regions. It has many features associated with more realistic racing games, including a photo mode, dynamically changing weather conditions, and time-of-day that will affect the racing experience.
Players will be able to go off-road and drive “virtually everywhere in this world” in a free-roam mode, while the drive from one race to another during a traditional Mario Kart four-course Grand Prix will be an integral “part of the competition.” Knockout Tour races are a new battle royale-style variant that see players racing from one side of the map to the other, getting knocked out at checkpoints as they go.
The trailer showed off a wide variety of custom vehicles, including snowmobiles, jet skis, and karts adapted for actual flight — not just gliding. On some levels, it’s possible to perform the Mario Kart equivalent of wall-running and grinding rails. The cast of characters encompassed all the Mario Kart favorites and a few wild cards (like a playable cow), and it seemed as though custom outfits will be a thing inMario Kart World.
There’ll be more detailed aboutMario Kart Worldin a dedicated Nintendo Direct on April 17.
Nintendo’s focus onMario Kart Worldat the launch of the Switch 2 is easy to explain: Its predecessor,Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, has been a smash hit on the original Switch, selling an astonishing 67 million copies. It’s the best-selling Switch game by a large margin. In fact, if you add sales of the original Wii U version to bring the total to almost 76 million,Mario Kart 8is thefifth-best-selling game of all time. It’s also, arguably, Nintendo’s biggest hit ever —Wii Sportshas shipped more copies, but that was bundled free with the Wii console in many territories.Mario Kart 8was so successful that Nintendo kept adding to it throughout the Switch’s lifespan, unleashing six waves of new courses and characters through the Booster Course pass.
So it’s no surprise that Nintendo should peg Switch 2 marketing to a hugely popular series that both defined and dominated the kart racing genre, and that has been a perennial on every Nintendo system sinceSuper Mario Kartdebuted on the SNES in 1992. Mario Kart is one of the biggest games series in the world. WillMario Kart Worldcontinue the trend?

"A mix of games, hardware, and Switch 1-compatible reveals
byMatt Patches
After months of speculation, Nintendo announcedthe Switch 2 consoleon Jan. 16 — and that was about it. With close-ups of the new unit and a few shots of a (theoretical) new Mario Kart, Nintendo went the Nintendo route of meeting extreme demand by doing whatever the hell it wanted on whatever timetable it felt like. The reveal came with a promise: more news on April 2.
The day has come. Inan hourlong Nintendo Direct presentationon Wednesday morning, Nintendo unveiled much, much, much more about its plans for Switch 2, which launches in June. To quote Mario: WAHOO! Here’s what went down.
TheNintendo Switch 2 will be released worldwide on June 5, 2025. In the U.S., the console by itself will cost $449.99, while a $499.99 package will be bundled with a digital copy of the launch titleMario Kart World. Nintendo will begintaking pre-orders on April 9, one week from now.
A new Mario Kart game was teased during the Switch 2’s initial reveal, but now it’s official:Mario Kart Worldis arriving for the console’s launch.
This version’s twist: The weather changes, off-roading is highly encouraged, and you keep on driving to the next course? Packing in 24 racers in each race makes this the most open-world experience of any Mario Kart, and there’s the promise of tons of social multiplayer modes.
Get ready for a revolutionary pitch: You can now communicate with friends and family while playing a game!
The Switch 2 has a microphone built into the console itself, versus the controller, but Nintendo promises that even if your bro is blending a protein shake in the same room, noise canceling tech makes it no problem to keep talking without a headset.
Nintendo emphasized the use of parental controls in order to contrast itself to the Wild West of Discord. But the big reveal? Turns out that Switch 2’s mysterious C button launches GameChat.
Nintendo is reinventing Zoom. While you can play your games and talk to your buds using GameChat, the new camera accessory — arriving at launch — can give your multiplayer sessions a video-call-esque twist.
While the Switch allowed for local play on one console using two Joy-Cons, the Switch 2’s GameShare function will allow pals to to play each other in a local setting using a single shared game — even if the friend doesn’t own a copy.
All the new technology packed into the Switch 2 excited the team at Nintendo so much, they decided to make an entire game that allows player to learn about and experiment with the various features. InNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, which feels like the Nintendo equivalent ofAstro’s Playroomon PlayStation 5, puts players in charge of a lil’ guy who goes around exploring a giant version of the console, as well as playing minigames that take advantage of the Joy-Con 2’s motion controls and mouse capabilities.
There are three types of games playable on Switch 2: Switch 2 exclusives, Switch 1 backward-compatible games, and “Nintendo Switch 2 Edition” games, which upgrade Switch titles with console-specific enhancements.Super Mario Party Jamboree, for instance, will be rereleased (but free to current owners) with new games like Bowser Live, which sees the king koopa doing karaoke? And the player sings? Lots of wacky stuff — but it’s all possible with the Switch 2’s more interactive capabilities.
Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomwill also receive enhanced editions for the Switch 2, boasting upgraded graphics and HDR support, plus a GPS-like Nintendo app integration that can direct you to hidden korok seeds. ATears-specific add-on lets friends share Zonai device builds using QR codes on the Nintendo app.
Optimized for the Joy-Con 2’s motion controls, this new game drops players into a wheelchair basketball match. Yes, Nintendo did aMurderball. The trailer shows of the unique moves needed to score and outpace your opponents.
Elden Ring,Split Fiction,Hogwarts Legacy,Hades 2,Street Fighter 6,Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4,Hitman World of Assassination, andCyberpunk 2077were among the many Switch 2 ports revealed during the Nintendo Direct. And a number of games, includingCivilization 7, will implement the Joy Con 2’s new mouse functionality.
Zelda is back for Switch 2, in the classic way Nintendo is known for before tentpole Zelda releases. The next installment ofthe hack-and-slash Hyrule Warriors seriesis a prequel toTears of the Kingdom, and chronicles the Imprisoning War, which was detailed over cutscenes in the original game. Now you can play them! The game will launch this winter.
Dreams can come true. Nintendo confirmed GameCube games will officially hit its online platform when Switch 2 launches in June. And the company will release a brand-new GameCube controller, complete with a GameChat-friendly C button, for the full nostalgic feel. Some major titles were teased in the presentation:The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Soulcalibur 2, andF-Zero GX— complete with multiplayer mode!
While fans probably expectedElden Ring Nightreignnews, and prayed for moreBloodborne, FromSoftware instead made a huge splash at the direct with something totally original. Full of mythical beasties, razor-sharp weapons, swirling magic, and gothic architecture, it’s calledThe Duskbloods. Nintendo promised we’d know much more information on the game — which will be available exclusively on Switch 2 — before it launches in 2026.
Kirby Air Ridersis a sequel to GameCube’sKirby Air Ride, and finds the puffy hero zipping around on stars once again. Two racing games promised for Switch 2? Classic Nintendo. But the nostalgia is real forKirby Air Riders, and the new game aims to faithfully reproduce its prismatic thrills. The game will launch in 2025.
The redesigned Donkey Kong, who reverted to his more retro look after a reintroduction inThe Super Mario Bros. Movie, is finally getting a new, stand-alone 3D platformer. DK will be smashing through an underground world dubbed Ingot Isle, in a game that looks like a worthy successor to his earlier adventures. The game drops the month after the Switch 2 launch, on July 17.

It’s been a huge few days for the Switch 2, with a jam-packedNintendo Directand our first opportunity to get hands on the console and try some of the new games and features. While a lot of the reveals have been exciting (Moo Moo inMario Kart!), the steep prices for theSwitch 2andgameshaveleft many questioningwhether investing in the new console is worth the cost.
We were lucky enough to get totry out the Switch 2, and theJoy Cons’ new mouse mode, and our early impressions can give you a sense of what to expect when the console launches in June. Below, you can find all of our Switch 2 coverage from this week, including news, takeaways, and analyses.

After many months, if not years, ofleaksand speculation, it’s finally official: Nintendohas announcedandfully revealedits next console. It’s calledNintendo Switch 2, and as the name implies, it’s a very similar design to the Switch — a hybrid handheld console with detachable controllers that can be connected to a TV via a dock.
While it may seem an obvious move, the iterative system is an unusual strategy for Nintendo, which has often chosen to innovate with its new hardware, finding new control systems and new forms of play. But, with 150 million units sold after eight years on the market, the Switch is Nintendo’s second most successful gaming system ever (after the Nintendo DS), and thethird-best-selling console of all time. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the company decided, for once, that its previous console design wasn’t broken and didn’t need fixing. Switch 2 also launches into a changed market, where players have come to expect that they will be able to carry their game libraries forward from one machine to another, which precluded a radical change.
Christopher Grant
January’s Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event took the wraps off the console, but left a lot of details unanswereduntil now. After the initial reveal, I put togetheran analysis of the possible pricingfor the console, using Nintendo’s own historical pricing strategies to guide my thinking. My conclusion then was that it would cost $399.
I…was wrong. The Nintendo Switch 2 will debut in Junestarting at $449.99, with a $499.99 version that includesMario Kart World.

We have a full view ofNintendo Switch 2 gamesnow theApril 2 Directhas come and gone — including a number of exclusives andlaunch titles, and that all-importantrelease datefor the console itself.
It follows months of slim pickings following the console’s initial hardware-focused reveal in January, which also saw developers and publishers holding fire of their involvement until now.
Cameron Faulkner
The Nintendo Switch 2 is launching onJune 5. Pre-orders were initially going live on Wednesday,April 9, but those plans have been postponed due toNintendo assessing the “potential impact of tariffs.” A new pre-order date will be shared at a later time.
The original article follows below.
Cameron Faulkner
Following the new tariffs instated by the Trump administration, the originalApril 9 pre-order date for the Nintendo Switch 2 has been postponed. The new pre-order day hasn’t been set, and will be shared by Nintendo at a later date. ItsJune 5 release dateis unchanged.
The original article follows below.

During anhourlong presentation on Wednesday, Nintendo bombarded prospective Switch 2 buyers with information about the new console and its games, including a torrent of ports from third-party publishers. But, once the dust had settled, it was easy to succumb to a creeping anxiety. Where were all the first-party launch titles from Nintendo itself?Mario Kart Worldlooks great, but isit $79.99 great?
Yes and no. Depending on how you define a launch game — and how you define a Switch 2 game — the Switch 2 will launch with anywhere between one and nine Nintendo games. You don’t have to expand these definitions to the absolute limit to realize that the Switch 2 is launching with relatively strong first-party support compared to Nintendo’s past systems. But it is true that Nintendo is approaching this launch a little differently.
Chelsea Stark
There’s a lot to talk about since theSwitch 2 reveal, and one of the jokey-but-not questions from many folks is:Will the Switch 2 mouse work on my pants?
Which makes sense! Rarely are we doing handheld or console gaming with a table in front of us, let alone a large, luxurious desk mat like the ones at theNintendo Switch 2hands-on event held in New York. I already wrote a bit onhow it feels to play with the Joy-Con’s mouse feature, but let’s get specific: How well does it work on pants? And various other non-mousepad surfaces?
Oli Welsh
During Wednesday’sSwitch 2 Direct, Nintendo revealed that some games for the original Switch could be upgraded to enhancedSwitch 2 Editionsby purchasing an upgrade pack. This isn’t surprising, coming from a company that has long loved to repackage old games for new consoles and sell them to fans a second (or third, or fourth) time. But it left some observers feeling that Nintendo was nickel-and-diming its fans — and it’s a strategy that comes with risks.
When launching a console that’sfully backward-compatible with its predecessor’s games, console makers have some tricky choices to make. One of the trickiest involves how to handle pricing and upgrades when there are versions of the same game for both platforms — particularly if the platform holder is increasing the price of games on the new system (as Nintendo is).
Alice Jovanée
Perhaps one of the more unexpected announcements to arrive out of the Nintendo Switch Direct is that theNintendo Switch 2will have a camera peripheral to supplement the console’s new group chat feature. While the Switch 2 will be compatible withthird-party USB-C webcams, the peripheral manufacturers at Hori are already producing their own adorable version of a camera for the Switch 2 modeled after the Piranha Plant.
Specifics surrounding the carnivorous camera are a bit slim. It isn’t currently advertised on the manufacturer’s website, and it has only been spotted in the wild at European retailerMediamarkt, which has the product listed for around $44, about $6 cheaper than thefirst-party model advertised by Nintendo. It appears that the stem will be detachable from the base and is flexible, to ensure you have the best possible angle. However, the coolest feature is that its mouth can be closed as a privacy shutter for the camera when not in use. Nintendo’s official camera for the Switch 2 has a similar feature, but I’m glad we’re already starting to see weird peripherals for the new console taking root.
Ian Walker
A slew of new amiibo were quietly revealed in addition toall the Switch 2 infoshared on April 2, confirming details gleaned from Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filingsa month ago.
Thenew figures, based on characters fromThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the KingdomandStreet Fighter 6, will launch alongside theSwitch 2on June 5. Six Sage descendants Tulin, Yunobo, Riju, and Sidon represent the Zelda franchise, while Street Fighter newcomers Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly join the previously released Ryu and Ken figures as part of the fighting game’s amiibo offerings.
Cameron Faulkner
A custom Nvidia processor is at the heart of theNintendo Switch 2, giving it power to push up to 120 frames per second in handheld mode, or up to 4K at 60 frames per second while docked.
While Nintendo has been cagey to share more details on its partnership with the graphics and AI giant, Nvidia published ashort press releaseconfirming the collaboration — and diving a little more deeply into the tech found in Nintendo’s surprisingly capable handheld.
Zoë Hannah
Nintendo held off announcing the price of theSwitch 2in its bigSwitch 2 Directon Wednesday. Instead, perhaps in preparation for the inevitable sticker shock, the $449 price point was slipped into a news release tucked away in a bevy of other facts. Nintendo also announced that a limited-supply bundle that comes with a copy ofMario Kart Worldwould retail for $499.99. The Mario Kart sequel runs $80 as a standalone game.
Even with rampant inflation of the U.S. economy, theSwitch 2 remains one of Nintendo’s most expensive consoles ever. Further, it’s crossing theonce-sacred $70 price pointfor games — a relatively ubiquitous price for AAA games that most major studios generally adhere to. (That price point has crept up over the years, with first-party Switch 1 games going for $60 in most cases.)
Chelsea Stark
Mario Kart Worldanswers the question, “How do you followMario Kart 8?” While the previous entry became fully stuffed with new and throwback racetracks, playingMario Kart Worldat Nintendo’s hands-onSwitch 2preview event blew up all my assumptions of what a Mario Kart track can be — and what the future could hold for the franchise.
The arcade racer hasn’t yet strayed from its format, but that’s about to change whenMario Kart Worldis released alongside the Switch 2 on June 5. In the time I spent withMario Kart Worldduring the preview event, I most enjoyed all the times I wasn’t strictly racing. I was just driving and vibing.
Russ Frushtick
While watching the bigNintendo Switch 2 Direct, I’m sure I wasn’t alone in expecting the long-awaited follow-up toSuper Mario Odyssey. When the final trailer kicked off with lush, cartoony environs, it seemed clear that the expectation was about to become reality. But nope, Nintendo’s big surprise game was actuallyDonkey Kong Bananza, a new 3D adventure game starring the king of the Kongs.
But is this just a palette swap? Maybe the developers wanted to make a new 3D platformer, but to mix it up they slotted in Donkey Kong instead of Mario. Effectively, is this the sequel toMario Odysseywe’ve been waiting for?
Russ Frushtick
If you were handed aNintendo Switch 2, you might not initially realize it. Sure, it might feel a little bigger in the hand, but otherwise the experience of holding Nintendo’s long-awaited follow-up feels familiar, with all the pluses and minuses that go along with that.
Delving a bit deeper, though, the improvements do become apparent. You just have to hunt for them.
Chelsea Stark
Nintendo announced that its Switch 2 Joy-Cons could beused as a mouse— in either hand, even — during itsSwitch 2 Directon April 2. Mice and other pointers have been aiding in making certain game movements more precise for decades, so the idea of a console-based mouse is tempting, if it’s implemented well.
During a hands-on event in New York City on Wednesday, I was able to test the Joy-Cons’ mouse mode on a few different gameplay experiences specifically designed to highlight it. Nintendo is a company known for unique (or sometimes gimmicky) implementations of control schemes, yet the mouse has had decades of refinement for computer gaming. Some of the experiences I had using the Joy-Con as a mouse felt traditional, but some left me scratching my head as to whether they would receive wider adoption.
Tyler Colp
On top of the improved graphical performance for theSwitch 2 versions ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom, there will be a suite of new features in the Nintendo Switch phone app, including an achievement system and, strangely, a voice navigation assistant.
The new service inside the Switch app is called Zelda Notes. It only works for theSwitch 2versions, and is “designed to provide a more streamlined gameplay experience,” according to theoverview trailer.
Christopher Grant
It’s a good thing that theNintendo Switch 2comes with a base 256 GB of internal storage — eight times more than the original Switch’s paltry 32 GB — because some Nintendo Switch 2 games won’t come on the cartridge at all. Instead, so-called game-key cards will simply contain a “key” that you will use to download the game, according toa support page on Nintendo’s website.
“After it’s downloaded, you can play the game by inserting the game-key card into your system and starting it up like a standard physical game card,” the page reads. Here’s how that looks on the retail packaging:
Tyler Colp
Navigating the eShop on the Nintendo Switch is a trial. Not only does it chug when you’re scrolling through games, it’s borderline impossible to find exactly what you want. Even new games are sometimes hard to find. And there areentire websitesdedicated to doing the heavy lifting for you so you don’t ever have to engage with it. It’s a mess that hasn’t been cleaned up for years.
According to Nintendo developers in arecent official interview, Switch 2’s updated eShop won’t be as awful to use.

Nintendo confirmed back in November 2024, two months before the company evenunveiled the Nintendo Switch 2, that the new console would bebackward-compatible with games for the original Nintendo Switch. Now, after detailing the system’s hardware and software in anhourlong Nintendo Direct presentation, the company has provided the first real specifics on the nature of Switch 2’s backward compatibility.
We now know that theSwitch 2will work with many Switch accessories — including, most importantly, the original console’s Joy-Cons and Pro Controller — as well as games. But as Nintendo has previously hinted, not every Switch game will be playable (or, at least, fully playable) on the Switch 2. Here’s what we’ve learned so far.
Michael McWhertor
Donkey Kong will break new ground in his newSwitch 2game,Donkey Kong Bananza. I mean that literally, in the sense that the 3D action-adventure game is about destruction and digging into the hard earth with DK’s meaty fists. ButBananzawill also push the Donkey Kong series forward by putting pants on Nintendo’s iconic ape. That’s right, Donkey Kong is no longer just weirdly wearing a tie but otherwise completely naked; this Kong wears trousers (and suspenders).
Do we have actor, producer, andceramics enthusiastSeth Rogento thank for this? Maybe.
Tyler Colp
Nintendo’s Switch 2 Directstream suffered technical issues at the most inopportune time for the developers ofAstroneer. Near the end of Wednesday’s presentation, a trailer for their new game debuted on the stream during a period where many viewers were stuck looking at a glitchy mess.
“Hey so uh one of the mainNintendo Switch 2 Directstreams completely ate our trailer due to I guess technical difficulties?” System Era Softworks social media manager Lotus Dwyer wrote onBluesky.
Chris Plante
Nintendo took an unusual approach to the past two decades of video game console wars. It stayed out of them. But with today’sNintendo Switch 2 info dump— packed with big-name third-party games rarely seen onNintendo hardware— the House that Mario Built appears ready to rejoin the fray. Why now? Credit a collision of confidence, opportunity, and necessity.
Sony and Microsoft have spent generations bloodying each other in a battle for the most extravagant visuals, courting favor with major publishers like Activision and Electronic Arts. Meanwhile, Nintendo swam in the opposite direction, favoring cheaper, less powerful machines that prioritized toy-like novelty over raw specs.

We knew there was a new Mario Kart coming to Switch 2, but we didn’t expect it to cost this much. After showing off the open-world racing gameMario Kart Worldon Wednesday during itsSwitch 2 Nintendo Directshowcase, Nintendo revealed that the game will have a $79.99 price tag. That’s new territory for Nintendo, which just two years ago made headlines bycharging $69.99forThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
ButMario Kart World’s high asking price doesn’t appear to be the standard for Switch 2 software. Nintendo also confirmed Wednesday thatDonkey Kong Bananza, coming to Switch 2 in July, will cost $69.99. Still, these are indicators that Nintendo is comfortable charging more not just for the Switch successor, but for its next-gen games too.

Thefull revealof theNintendo Switch 2was largely focused on all the new games you can play. The hardware specs weren’t the focus, but Nintendo dropped a detailed list of what’s inside the Switch 2 on its website. Most of what we knew from the original announcement video and some leaks turned out to be true: It’s a bigger, better handheld console with a full slate of upgraded hardware.
Here’s what we now know, specs-wise, about the Nintendo Switch 2.

A big new Donkey Kong 3D platforming adventure is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo announced Wednesday during itsNintendo Directshowcase dedicated to the new console. It’s calledDonkey Kong Bananza, and it will send (fresh new look) Donkey Kong to heretofore unexplored, underground territories where he’ll smash, grab, and throw things at anyone who stands in his way.
Donkey Kong Bananzawill be released on July 17, about six weeks after theNintendo Switch 2 launchesin June, and it’ll cost $69.99.

"Less than 24 hours remain until Nintendo’s big Switch 2 Direct
byMichael McWhertor
It’s the dawn of the final day. On Wednesday, April 2, Nintendo promises to give its fans a closer look atSwitch 2, the successor to its wildly popular portable-console hybrid. And while Nintendo is famously secretive and unpredictable, there’s a lot we already know about Switch 2.
Still, there are manyunanswered questions about Switch 2, and Nintendo’s ability to keep information under wraps and preserve surprises means that what we think we know about the next-generation Switch likely pales in comparison to whatthis week’s 60-minute Nintendo Directwill reveal.
That said, here are our best predictions for the impending Nintendo Direct that’s all about Switch 2.
With the Switch 2 expected to launch as early as June, Nintendo will likely reveal the release date, price, and when customers can pre-order the system. Based on what we’ve heard,Switch 2 pre-orders should go live at most retailers on April 9, giving Nintendo fans a window to consider their purchases and not have to scramble to pre-order one immediately after the Nintendo Direct. (In some territories, like Nintendo’s home base in Japan, the Direct won’t conclude until late at night.)
Switch 2, based on what we’ve heard, is expected to launch in the first half of June.
We expect the price to besomewhere between $399 and $449. Nintendo may be waiting until the very last minute to decide price, which — inthiseconomy — seems like a tough decision to make.
Nintendo not only added a brand-new button to the Switch 2 Joy-Cons, it’s beenteasing that new C button’s functionalityahead of time on its recently launched Nintendo Today app. What the C button does is still a mystery for now, but all signs point to a new chat tool or community-focused feature.
We’ll find out what the C button is for, officially, on Wednesday. But based on Nintendo’s increasing fascination with big multiplayer games, and last year’sNintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program, which tested “the boundaries of mass multiplayer functionality and gameplay” on Nintendo’s servers, we expect some sort of big, Nintendo-controlled community feature or MMO-scale game to be shown — and that would be a great opportunity to showcase the new C button functionality, if it is indeed chat- or community-focused.
We’re getting a new Mario Kart, that’s for sure. But what else Nintendo has planned for Switch 2 is a big mystery. We expect at least one game to show off theSwitch 2 Joy-Cons’ new mouse-control featuresand probably a new Super Mario game.
Nintendo also has to give Switch owners a long list of reasons to upgrade to Switch 2, and the best way to do that is through compelling software.Mario Kart 9would be a big deal, of course, but we expect Nintendo to show up with a teaser or announcement of at least one other big franchise, like Animal Crossing, Super Smash Bros., or Splatoon.
But Nintendo will also likely showcase how well Switch games run on Switch 2. Maybe the best way to do that would be to showThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildorTears of the Kingdomrunning on Switch 2, at higher resolution and with better frame rates. First details on“Switch 2 Edition” versions of gameswill definitely be a talking point.
Third-party software publishers will likely open the floodgates of their back catalogs to bring games from PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X to a new console. But don’t expect that flood of ports to be showcased at the Nintendo Direct. Instead, we anticipate that only a handful of major third-party publishers like Capcom, Sega, Microsoft, and Ubisoft will get some space during the Direct to show their support for Switch 2.
Nintendo is reportedly being cautious about which third-party developers are getting Switch 2 development kits ahead of launch, but we expect that to change once details about the new system are in the wild.

"What do you hear?
byIan Walker
A new post in theNintendo Today appteases the potential functionality of thatC button we’ve all been discussingfor months with a very Mii-like sound effect as part of the countdown toWednesday’s Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct.
If you live in a region where it’s already April 2, you may have seen a short Nintendo Today video specifically promoting the C button. Over the course of seven seconds, we’re shown aJoy-Con attached to a Nintendo Switch 2before a quick zoom into the C button. A finger presses the button. The button makes asound. The sound is a nonsensical mixture of an activation jingle and what sounds likea Mii speaking.
Does this mean Miis are back? Maybe! And maybe it’s a sign Nintendo is launching a Miiverse-like social media platform —a fan favorite featurefrom the Wii U and 3DS era — that will be launched with the C button. Listen to the sound above about a million times and get back to us.
When Nintendo first revealed the Switch 2back in January, the new Joy-Cons showcased alongside the device featured a mysterious, unmarked button. Everyonealmost immediately assumedthis meant the C button was returning after it skipped multiple console generations, speculation that was awardedearlier this weekthanks to another Nintendo Today post. Even so, we’ve remained in the dark as to what the C buttonactually does.
Whether the C button opens a new Miiverse-style chatting app, allows for saving screenshots and video recordings, or just makes a funny noise and nothing else, we’re almost certain to learn more during tomorrow’s Switch 2 presentation. Stay tuned!

"After conquering the alarm clock, Nintendo makes a good calendar
byMichael McWhertor
Nintendo now has a way to distance itself from toxic social media platforms it can’t control with a new daily news app called Nintendo Today. While Nintendo Today in its current state is little more than a thinly populated newsfeed, the app’s calendar feature might make the thing worth installing.
Four months ago, Nintendoreleased a Spotify-like appthat only plays Nintendo music. Appropriately namedNintendo Music, the app gives the Mario and Zelda maker the means to control how fans listen to its games’ themes and soundtracks, officially, without having to rely on (or share revenue with) a third party.
Nintendo made a similar move with the Nintendo Switch Online app, a messaging and chat platform that serves as an alternative to messaging platforms like Discord — which has been integrated by rivals Sony and Microsoft on their consoles. The NSO app includes game-specific services (like Nooklink forAnimal Crossing: New Horizons), but the main draw is supposed to be interacting with your online friends and using voice chat during online play. You know, stuff many people would actually prefer to do on Discord.
Nintendo Today is Nintendo’s latest attempt to carve out its own space, where it can send news directly to its fanbase. Like its famous Nintendo Direct presentations, the app seems like a way to bypass media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and X (formerly Twitter), which have become exponentially less pleasant to engage with as time progresses.
The company has already used Nintendo Today to break news. On Friday morning, less than 24 hours after announcing the app, the company placed a 25-second video at the top of the feedannouncing the 2027 release date for the live-action movie based on The Legend of Zelda. It has also “leaked”new images of the Switch 2itself. The newsfeed also includes a few timely morsels, like a countdown to this week’sNintendo Direct: Switch 2 showcaseand a few trailers from thelatest Nintendo Direct. The feed is otherwise populated with supplementary fluff, like a brief history of the Fire Emblem series, orchestral performances of video game music, and funny “pearls of wisdom” from Animal Crossing’s beloved otter, Pascal.
Nintendo Today’s attempt at newsbreaking comes with a fault, at least at launch. Despite having opted in to notifications from the app, Nintendo Today didn’t actually alert me to Friday’s news about The Legend of Zelda movie. I had to (gasp!) actuallyopen the app manuallyin the morning to check what was new for myself. Hopefully, like the app’s brief second-day outage, these are just growing pains.
It’s Nintendo Today’s calendar, though, that will likely keep the app installed on my phone. In addition to delivering adorable daily animations based on Nintendo series like Pikmin, Super Mario, and Animal Crossing, there’s surprisingly useful information in here. The calendar keeps track of past and upcoming events, like Nintendo Direct streams and real-world events like the opening of Nintendo’s San Francisco retail store. It also tracks release dates for games and demos, and in-game events. Thanks to the latter feature, I can now keep tabs on upcoming events forAnimal Crossing: New Horizons, ensuring I never miss a Bunny Day or fishing tourney.
Nintendo Today’s calendar currently keeps track of in-game events for 11 titles, includingSplatoon 3,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Tetris 99, andMario Kart Tour. As someone with a short attention span who relies on various notifications to keep me informed and on task, I’m looking forward to seeing how well the app can help me keep track of real-world and virtual events. (Frankly, I’m also greatly anticipating things like release dates leaking through the app. That’s bound to happen.)
Like other Nintendo-developed smart-device apps, Nintendo Today is a slick but nascent tool that does about half of what I’d ideally want it to do. It’s doubtful that Nintendo Today will ever achieve the goal of fully replacing any of services like Facebook, Instagram, and X, at least from a news-delivery perspective, but it’s off to a decent start.

"Thoughts on revisiting the forgotten Wii U version of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
byOli Welsh
AsShigeru Miyamoto never actually said, “A delayed game is eventually good, but a bad game is forever bad.” This sliding-doors concept gains an additional, poignant dimension when consideringThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, because that game’s delay affected more than its quality. Originally planned for release in 2015 as a Wii U exclusive,Breath of the Wild’s shift to early 2017 moved it onto the launch lineup for the Nintendo Switch. It went from propping up a failed console to becoming the game thatdefined the Switch, and redefined Nintendo, for a whole new era.
That halo has made it easy to forget that the Wii U version ofBreath of the Wildwas actually released. Not for the first time, Nintendo chose a Zelda game to play the dual role of swan song for one generation and curtain-raiser for another (appropriately for the Zelda series, with its preoccupation with the closed loop of history). In 2006,Twilight Princesswas released on both the outgoing GameCube and the brand-new Wii. On that occasion, you could see the cracks. The Wii’s novel motion controller was an awkward fit forTwilight Princess, and the game’s deliberate classicism clashed with the bright, casual, carefully neutral aesthetic Nintendo was advancing with other launch titles likeWii Sports. It was clearly a GameCube holdover in ill-fitting clothing.
Nintendo was not about to let the same thing happen toBreath of the Wild— this time, it optimized the game for the new console and retrofitted it into the old. Firing the Wii U version up recently, I found exactly the same game that had seared itself into our collective consciousness. Producer Eiji Aonuma, director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, and their team had taken care to stamp out anything that might have tied it to the idiosyncrasies of the Wii U hardware.
If anything, it is the Wii U version that feels out of place, mostly due to its performance issues. Nintendo took advantage of the small amount of extra headroom afforded by the Switch’s specs to output a higher-resolution image when docked, and to push the physics engine and environmental detail past the point the Wii U was comfortable with. Mostly,Breath of the Wildplays great on Wii U, but it suffers from a very choppy frame rate when subjecting Bokoblins to physics-based carnage, panning past deep vistas of the Hyrule landscape, or visiting densely detailed locations like Kakariko Village.
It’s not unplayable, but not what you expect of Nintendo; that the company was happy to live with this level of performance says a lot about the extent to which it had already moved on from the Wii U. The game also looks a little hazy and washed-out by comparison to the Switch version, whether played in 720p on a big TV or on the Wii U Gamepad’s inferior screen.
Otherwise, though,Breath of the Wildis entirely uncompromised on Wii U. Or is it? Playing the game on a TV, with the chunky slab of the Gamepad in your hands, you get a faint, vestigial sense of a more bespoke Wii U experience that might have been. When Link collects his Sheikah Slate and downloads a map onto it, it seems like a deliberate echo of the console’s unique dual-screen functionality. Surely we were meant to have the map open in our laps as we played, or to be navigating Link’s inventory on the touchscreen. In fact, Nintendo haddemonstrated touchscreen featuresforBreath of the Wildback in 2014, but stripped them out to ensure total parity with the Switch version — and because, Fujibayashi said, looking between the two screens could be distracting.
PlayingBreath of the Wildon Wii U is very fun becauseBreath of the Wildis very fun. (Have you heard? It’s a good game.) It’s also a little sad, because as misbegotten as the Wii U was,Breath of the Wildshould have been its crowning glory. Instead, this version is a slightly hobbled afterthought living in the shadow of the definitive masterwork it became on another console. It sold 1.7 million copies on Wii U, and 32.6 million on Switch.
Playing such a familiar game in this unfamiliar form brought home to me how prophetic the design of the Wii U was. At the time, it was poorly understood, but without it, the Switch could never have happened. The Wii U wasalmostthe right idea atslightlythe wrong time. The Gamepad’s form factor, which once felt so ungainly, feels totally natural in the era of the Steam Deck. And the magic of instantly switching your gameplay from the TV to the tablet in your hands hasn’t dimmed. This is the entire concept of the Switch, just with the roles reversed.
The other day, I fancied playingBreath of the Wildin the evening, but didn’t want to hide from my family in my office, where the Wii U was plugged in. With a sudden jolt of delight, I realized —remembered— that I could just bring the Gamepad to the sofa and continue playing there. With the Wii U, Nintendo imagined a better world where your gaming could fit around and into your life. With the Switch, it made that world a reality.

"This week’s games balance horror and joy

The new game releases this week waver between horrifying and charming. Sometimes the premise of a game is pretty sad on its face, but the stuff you do isn’t as bleak. That’s the case for a couple games arriving this week. However, that’s not true forThe Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, a game fully committed to misery. There are cheerful moments in it, though, so it technically counts. Just don’t go into it expecting to spend 40 hours riffing on Ellie’s guitar.
Koiradrops just before the rest of the games on the list arrive on Thursday. It’s a game about exploring a forest with a lost puppy, and if I think too hard about where that story might go I’ll cry. Then there’s Naughty Dog’s bleak, post-apocalyptic shooter where you can’t go 45 minutes without watching something awful happen.Sandalso comes out on that day and brings a fun twist to the extraction shooter genre: spider tanks. AndCaligoandSephiriaare two games that look more pleasant than they actually are. One of them lets you play as a bunny warrior, though.
Here are our most anticipated game releases for the week of March 31.
Release date:April 1Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PCThis little adventure game is for dog lovers. Your character finds a puppy and goes on an adventure in a magical, musical forest. It’s like a single-player co-op game as you solve puzzles and work together to find home.
Release date:April 3Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PCJust in time for theHBO show’s second season,The Last of Us Part 2is finally coming to PC. This version will have improved graphics, the No Return roguelike mode, and a whole developer commentary mode to learn how the game was made.
Release date:April 3Platforms:Windows PCMuch likeRust,Sandis another survival game with a straightforward title. OK, it’s more than that: It’s also an extraction shooter where everyone drives weird spider tanks. Basically, the game looks like Mad Max with rocket launchers.
Release date:April 3Platforms:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis dreamlike walking simulator is coming to consoles this week. This game has a variety of places to explore, like pretty fantasy forests and hellish nightmare worlds. This is a game full of surprises.
Release date:April 3Platforms:Windows PCYou’re a bunny in a pixel world of animals, artifacts, and roguelike action. This early access game is all about finding gear and equipping yourself to protect the other animals of the land. And even though it’s not finished yet, it already has four levels and over 250 items to find.

"Get your credit cards ready
byMichael McWhertor
Pre-orders for theNintendo Switch 2will open on Wednesday, April 2 — if you believe retailer Best Buy Canada, which announced that pre-order date in a blog post (and thenquickly pulled it) on Thursday. A new report fromInsider Gaming, citing documents from an unnamed “large U.S. retailer,” says pre-orders for Switch 2 will open a week later, on April 9.
Nintendo itself hasn’t announced when pre-orders for Switch 2 will go live, so it’s unclear if the company will start taking pre-orders the same day it holds itsNintendo Direct: Switch 2 showcase(April 2), or if it will give us another week to consider the next-gen system’s merits. Polygon has reached out to Nintendo for comment and will update when the company responds.
While Nintendo hasn’t announced a release date or price for its new system, Switch 2 is expected to launch in early June, meaning that pre-orders would likely be open for about two months.
In between Nintendo’s full reveal of Switch 2 and its expected launch, the company will hold a series ofhands-on Nintendo Switch 2 Experience eventsacross the globe.
Anticipation for the Switch successor is high, and Nintendo is reportedlystockpiling a large number of Switch 2 consolesto meet that demand. That demand may fluctuate based on how much Nintendo will charge for Switch 2, but that’s something we’re bound to know soon enough.

"Nintendo’s full reveal will hopefully answer all of these unknowns
byMichael McWhertor
This story was first published in Switchboard, a newsletter from Polygon that delivers all the latest Switch 2 news, reporting, and rumors directly to your inbox.Sign up hereto get it weekly.
This time next week, we’ll know a lot more about theNintendo Switch 2. A newNintendo Direct showcasededicated to the top-secret handheld console will air on the morning of Wednesday, April 2. That presentation will offer a first look at new games, hardware details, and hopefully much more.
Ahead of the event, we have a long list of questions that Nintendo still needs to answer. Here are some of the biggest unknowns about Switch 2.
Some of the biggest questions we’re hoping will be addressed during the Nintendo Direct surround the new Joy-Con controllers. Will they have Hall effect joysticks, as previously reported? And does that mean stick drift is a thing of the past?
How will the rumoredmouse control features of the Joy-Conswork? More crucially, do Joy-Cons actually feel good as mice? Are players going to need a dedicated mousing surface, or will a coffee tabletop or couch surface suffice?
Importantly, how do the new, larger Joy-Cons feel in the hand? Will those bigger shoulder buttons work as well as we’d hoped? And what does thatnew “C” button on the right Joy-Condo?
The Switch’s Joy-Cons were a pretty radical reinvention for game controllers, both revolutionary and quite flawed. That’s why the full reveal of the Joy-Con (2.0) controllers will be so fascinating to watch, to see how Nintendo moves its design forward and fixes the original version’s shortcomings.
Officially, we only know of one Nintendo-developed game coming to Switch 2 at this point: a new Mario Kart game. But Nintendo has reportedly been building up a strong library of internally developed Switch 2 games, and while we have some ideas about which dev teams could be working on which franchises, Nintendo is excellent at keeping secrets and delivering surprises.
Arecurrent-gen Switch games being developed with Switch 2 in mind, meaning will they support higher resolutions and improved frame rates? (Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Editionmay have already answered this question.)
Frankly, I think we’re all wondering which Nintendo franchises will show up during the Switch 2’s first year. Will Nintendo have a new 2D or 3D Mario ready for launch?
Beyond franchises, perhaps the most exciting thing yet to be revealed is the Switch 2’s equivalent ofWii Sports,Nintendo Land, and1-2-Switch— a game or games that will show what the new system is capable of and what differentiates it from the original Switch.
Which third parties will show up for Switch 2? And how strongly? Both Microsoft and Ubisoft seem ready to step in and support Switch 2 with a long line of AAA games that couldn’t fit on a Switch, but seem like a perfect fit for Switch 2.
Microsoft has publicly voiced interest in Switch 2, meaning franchises like Halo, Call of Duty, Forza, and Fallout could make a strong showing on Nintendo’s new console. If Microsoft does fully embrace Switch 2, it could be a windfall not just for the Xbox maker, but for Nintendo fans, who will have a big, broad range of very good franchises to play on their new systems.
Ubisoft is a longtime supporter of Nintendo consoles out of the gate, and it has a back catalog of Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy games from the past decade it could repackage for the new and more powerful Nintendo handheld. Other publishers like Sega, Capcom, and Electronic Arts could follow with remasters and rereleases. Suffice it to say, AAA game makers have a potentially big new revenue stream with Switch 2, and I expect owners of the new system to be flush with choice.
That smorgasbord also includes indie games. Nintendo has shown strong support for independent game developers during the Switch era, with dedicated Indie World showcases, which I expect will continue on Switch 2. Are Switch indie devs like Team Cherry and Supergiant Games ready to drop their long-awaited sequels on Switch 2?
A late spring/early summer release for Switch 2 is looking more and more likely, based on the timing of Nintendo’s hands-on events for the console and Polygon’s own sources. We’ve heard that an early June launch is planned.
If that’s the case, a firm date should be announced at April’s Nintendo Direct. June is just two months away; retailers will need time to get up to speed and customers will need to get pre-orders in for Switch 2’s launch.
A bigger unknown, and one that feels a little fluid at this point, is price. While $399 seems like the sweet spot for Switch 2, a weak yen, fluctuating component costs, and price uncertainty related to tariffs threatened by the Trump administration could have an impact on Nintendo’s pricing decisions. Some analysts arepredicting a potentially higher price— upward of $499 — and if that’s the case, there will be one more question that’s yet to be answered: Will Switch 1 owners pay that much?

"Release date revealed via Nintendo Today!
byMichael McWhertor
The live-actionThe Legend of Zelda moviewill be released worldwide on March 26, 2027, Nintendo announced Friday. Nintendo revealed the film’s release date through its new smart-device app,Nintendo Today, not through more traditional social media channels like Instagram, YouTube, or X (formerly known as Twitter).
Nintendo’sZelda movie was announced in 2023. Nintendo is partnering with Sony Pictures Entertainment for the project, with The Legend of Zelda co-creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Hollywood veteran Avi Arad producing. Miyamoto said in 2023 that he’d been working on the movie for “many years now.”
Wes Ball, director of the Maze Runner film trilogy andKingdom of the Planet of the Apes, will helm the live-action adaptation of the fantasy franchise.Ball told Polygonlast year that he wants his take on The Legend of Zelda to be more “grounded” and “real,” and not based on fully motion-captured computer graphics.
Nintendo has another movie coming next year: anew animated film set in the world of Super Mario Bros. For the follow-up to 2023’sThe Super Mario Bros. Movie, Shigeru Miyamoto hinted that “We’re thinking about broadening Mario’s world further, and it’ll have a bright and fun story.” The new Super Mario movie is coming to theaters April 3, 2026.
Nintendo’s choice to eschew traditional media channels certainly indicates confidence in its new Nintendo Today app as either a replacement or first choice to deliver news like The Legend of Zelda movie’s release date. That app is available to download from Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store, and requires a Nintendo Account.

"Small print for Virtual Game Cards mentions ‘Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games’
byOli Welsh
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
In the small print ofan explainerabout its newVirtual Game Cardsystem for digital purchases, Nintendo appeared to confirm that some Switch games will get enhanced versions forSwitch 2— or at any rate, versions native to the Switch 2 console.
A footnote to the article reads, “Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system.” The note also implies that the Switch 2 will use the Virtual Game Card system as well, and will be able to exchange Switch 1 games with an original Switch.
The Switch 2 is confirmed to be fully backward compatible with its predecessor’s software, so it will be able to play (almost) any Switch game regardless. But Nintendo’s mention of “Switch 2 Edition games,” as opposed to “Switch 2 exclusive games,” suggests that some Switch games will get cross-gen versions that run natively on Switch 2 rather than through the backward-compatibility layer.
This opens the door to enhanced versions of back-catalog titles, such asThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, as well as upcoming Switch releases likeMetroid Prime 4: Beyond. It’s an expected move that has been made commonplace by the latest generations of PlayStation and Xbox consoles. But it’s still the first indication from Nintendo that it will go down this route for cross-gen releases.
It remains to be seen whether Nintendo will charge extra for Switch 2 Edition games. Sony did so for some PlayStation 5 upgrades of PlayStation 4 titles, while Microsoft elected to offer what it called Xbox Series X Enhanced versions of Xbox One games for free.
How the Switch 2 handles backward compatibility, and any potential performance enhancements for older games, is one of the bigger questions about the system ahead of itsfull reveal on April 2. This fine print answers one of our questions about it, but many more remain.

"What’s in pole position for gaming’s top prize? Let’s make some predictions
byOli Welsh
The 11th Game Awards, scheduled for Dec. 11, will come at the end of a watershed year for gaming that will see the launches ofNintendo Switch 2and (in theory)Grand Theft Auto 6. Both of those releases will likely loom large over theGame of the Yearcompetition at the leading awards ceremony for the game industry — the Oscars of gaming, as it were. But they are not the whole story. Even the first few months of 2025 have seen a number of surprisingly strong GOTY contenders come to light.
The Game Awards’ voting bodyis composed of a wide range of international games media (Polygon included), with a 10% contribution from fan voting. There area number of strong indicatorsfor what will perform well in the Game of the Year category. A high Metacritic rating (preferably over 90) is a must; role-playing games and action-adventures are strongly favored, as are games with strong narrative elements; indie and multiplayer games struggle harder for recognition than AAA single-player adventures. We used these metrics to correctly predict last year’s winner,Astro Bot. (We also got four of the six nominees right, and correctly called 14 other categories.)
Below, you’ll find our predictions for the most likely nominees, of which there are six each year, for Game of the Year 2025. Unlike the film industry, where most titles are known quantities well in advance, you never really know what kind of impact a video game will have, or how good it will be, until it’s out. With that in mind, this list only includes games that are already out. We’ll update these rankings throughout the year as new games are released. We’ll also list some likely upcoming contenders, and in future updates, we’ll predict some of the 2025 GOTY race’s dark horses, too.
Why it could win:Critical consensus is still the most reliable indicator of success at The Game Awards, and as the only game released so far this year with a rating over 90 on both Metacritic and OpenCritic, Hazelight’s co-op adventure is the clear front-runner in this regard. It’s got a legacy advantage, too: Hazelight’s previous game,It Takes Two, won GOTY in 2021, and since then has amassed amassive popular following. As a story-led action-adventure,Split Fictionalso belongs to a genre that the Game Awards jury has been known to favor in the past.
Weaknesses:PerhapsIt Takes Two’s win will count against it if jury members are looking for something different to reward. Also, whileIt Takes Two’s intensely personal story about divorce was unquestionably a strength,Split Fictionhas been praised more for its design than its abstract and overworked tale of writers adrift in virtual reality.
Why it could win:This could bethis year’sBlack Myth: Wukong: an ambitious hit game from a developer operating outside the gaming establishment, delivering on core gamers’ ardent desire for massive solo adventures made without compromise.Deliverance 2is a realistic medieval RPG with strong storytelling, and critics really liked it (its Metascore is 88). Another similar game might be the 2015 GOTY winner,The Witcher 3. This is right in The Game Awards’ sweet spot.
Weaknesses:Black Myth: Wukongdidn’t win GOTY— much to its producer’s chagrin. Just likeBlack Myth’s Game Science, Kingdom Come developer Warhorse is considered politically radioactive by some, after founder Daniel Vávra madepro-Gamergate commentsin 2015. Perhaps more to the point, the game is a challenging time sink that isn’t that broadly played among journalists and jurors, despite respectable sales.
Why it could win:Monster Hunter’s steady climb from co-op curio, through handheld sensation, to AAA champion climaxed with the huge sales and glowing reviews ofWilds. It’s slick, it’s gorgeous, and it’s sanded off Monster Hunter’s rough edges. (As a rule, the Game Awards jury isn’t keen on rough edges.)
Weaknesses:AlthoughWildsgestures toward a more conventional RPG storytelling style than previous Monster Hunters, this is still a deeply systemic game in which the equipment grind matters way more than players’ personal investment in the characters, and that’s not The Game Awards’ favorite look for a GOTY winner.
Why it could win:It only missed the deadline for the 2024 awards by a week or two, but MachineGames’ take on the indelible movie hero was swiftly acclaimed for all the things the jury likes to see: strong, performance-led storytelling, polished tech, high production values, a good mix of action and more cerebral play, and Troy Baker. It would almost certainly have been nominated for a GOTY 2024, and April’s PlayStation 5 release will be a big help in keepingGreat Circlein the conversation all the way up until the 2025 nomination process begins.
Weaknesses:PS5 release notwithstanding, 12 months is anawfullylong time to stay relevant in the race. The Game Awards do not typically reward licensed games. And the mid-80s Metacritic and OpenCritic scores are good, but indicate the critical consensus on this game is a little softer than it first appeared.
Why it could win:Obsidian Games’ traditional fantasy RPG is an interesting case. Its initial critical reception was on the soft side, but it has had a long tail and strong word of mouth, as players found its dependable, old-fashioned qualities — satisfying combat, excellent writing, and moreish loot — tough to turn away from. Genre-wise, as an undemanding and strongly narrative-focused RPG, it’s in a Game Awards sweet spot.Avowedis definitely undervalued, and though it will probably get pushed out of the likely nominees over the course of the year, it’s the definition of a dark horse.
Weaknesses:It would be very, very surprising for a game with a mere 80 Metascore to get nominated for Game of the Year. Surprising, but not unprecedented:Black Myth: Wukongmanaged it with an 81 Metascorelast year.
Why it could win:It might not be enough to save Ubisoft, but the whole gaming community heaved a sigh of relief when the first major Assassin’s Creed in four and a half years turned out to be good. This is AAA open-world gaming done right, with lavish production values and memorable characters.
Weaknesses:For whatever reason, the Game Awards jury is not that keen on Assassin’s Creed. 2018’sOdysseyis the only game in the series to score a Game of the Year nomination, and though it was nominated in four categories, it won none. Perhaps, like Call of Duty, the series’ heavily commercialized ubiquity is seen as a disqualifier by the judges.Shadows’ 81 Metascore is certainly too low to buck that trend.
Grant Theft Auto 6:It’s been such a long time since there was a mainline Grand Theft Auto game that The Game Awards weren’t around whenGTA 5was released. It’shard to see anything beating Rockstar’s behemoth— if, and it’s a big if, it makes its 2025 release date.
Metroid Prime 4: Beyond:Nintendo may well have multiple GOTY contenders in Switch 2’s release year, but the only one we know about for sure is Retro Studios’ very long-awaited return to the first-person sci-fi adventures of Samus.
Hades 2:Assuming it emerges from early access this year, Supergiant’s roguelike sequel will likely be leading the indie contenders for the year — out to avenge the original game’s perceived snub at the 2020 awards. (It’s eligible regardless, but the jury prefers not to nominate early access games.)
Death Stranding 2:Hideo Kojima is a Game Awards favorite and the originalDeath Strandingcontended strongly in 2019, although it ultimately lost toSekiro.Death Strandingwas divisive at the time, but in the years since, multiple rereleases have helped players get their heads around this singular vision, and with PlayStation’s full muscle behind it, the sequel is sure to make a big splash.
Ghost of Yōtei:No publisher has a better record at the Game Awards than Sony, and its other contender this year is this open-world samurai adventure — again, a sequel to a game (Ghost of Tsushima) whose reputation has only grown over time. If nothing else, this more rarefied, bespoke-feeling release will probably edge out the similarly themedAssassin’s Creed Shadows.
South of Midnight:The Game Awards jury is sure to love the culturally specific, character-forward storytelling of Compulsion Games’ occult adventure in the Deep South, which likely stands in for a delayedFable(and potentially replacesIndiana Jones) as Xbox Game Studios’ most likely contender. But its gameplay is an unknown quantity, and Compulsion’s record is a little patchy.

"This is a life-changing update for families of Switch users
byOli Welsh
In a surprise announcement during Thursday’s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed a major change to the way digital game purchases will be handled. From now on, digital Switch games will become Virtual Game Cards that can be swapped back and forth between consoles, and even borrowed by family members.
For players with multiple Switch consoles, Virtual Game Cards can be swapped between the systems at will. Local communication between the two systems is required, but only the first time. An internet connection is required when “ejecting” or “loading” a Virtual Game Card, but not at any other point to use the game.
Crucially, there are no restrictions on the number of accounts on a Switch that can use the Virtual Game Card. In this way, it behaves just like a physical game card — and unlike the previous digital purchases, which can be used by every account on the owner’s primary console, but only by the owner on a secondary console. They also require an internet connection to work on a secondary console.
Answering another key frustration of families of Nintendo Switch users, Virtual Game Cards can be lent to other family members whose accounts are grouped together. These loans last 14 days, after which the Virtual Game Card is automatically returned to its owner. You can only lend one game to each family member at a time.
As a member of a family with multiple Switch players, I can confirm that this is a literally life-changing update, despite the restrictions Nintendo has placed on it. I have only bought physical Switch games for years for precisely this reason, and have been unable to usefully share my digital library. No longer!
Nintendo made no mention of the Switch 2 during its Virtual Game Card announcement. We’ll have to wait and see whether the new console is compatible with the Virtual Game Card system — although it seems tailor-made to make it easier for new Switch 2 owners to manage their digital libraries across their old and new consoles.

There are three things I love above all else: coffee shops,cozy games, andDisney. And I learned duringThursday’s Nintendo Directthat someone apparently directly probed my brain and made a game combining all three of those great loves in a new game, coming out today on Nintendo Switch, calledDisney Villains Cursed Café.
In this game, you take on the role of a potionista — that’s a barista for potions — as you work at a rundown café turned potion shop. You serve up concoctions to Disney villains, who are all rocking some slick modern AU clothes that really match up with their personalities. OfcourseGaston would be coming right from his golfing session with that little visor.

You read that right — there’s a brand-new Rhythm Heaven game,Rhythm Heaven Groove, coming to Nintendo Switch… in 2026. Nonetheless, fans are likely thrilled to have any update on any new game in a series that hasn’t had a new title since 2015 for the Nintendo 3DS.
Rhythm Heaven Groovelooks to be what it says on the tin: a head-boppin’ rhythm RPG that has players clicking to the beat to get to the next level. In true Rhythm Heaven form, the game will have tons of mini-games inside, but all of the games will test your sense of timing. You might even have to practice polyrhythms!

Nintendo has revealed a bit more aboutMetroid Prime 4: Beyond, due later this year — but made no mention of the strongly rumored possibility that there will be a Switch 2 version as well as a the planned 2025 release for the original Switch. The game’s release date remains a vague “2025.”
During Thursday’s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo showed a new trailer that revealed Samus will gain new psychic powers as she explores the jungle planet of Viewros. The powers enable Samus to manipulate magnets and doors with her mind, and even bend the trajectory of her beams.

"Disney Villains Cursed Café arrives on Switch later today
byPetrana Radulovic
There are three things I love above all else: coffee shops,cozy games, andDisney. And I learned duringThursday’s Nintendo Directthat someone apparently directly probed my brain and made a game combining all three of those great loves in a new game, coming out today on Nintendo Switch, calledDisney Villains Cursed Café.
In this game, you take on the role of a potionista — that’s a barista for potions — as you work at a rundown café turned potion shop. You serve up concoctions to Disney villains, who are all rocking some slick modern AU clothes that really match up with their personalities. OfcourseGaston would be coming right from his golfing session with that little visor.
Yzma helps you upgrade potion ingredients (though hopefully none of them willturn you into a llama). The best part, though, is that you’re not just brewing and serving potions — apparently the potions you make can influence these characters’ storylines and lead to different game endings. I can’t wait to see what sorts of shenanigans these villains will get up to.
Disney Villains Cursed Caféwill be available on Nintendo Switch later today.

"You’ll have to wait until 2026, though…
byZoë Hannah
You read that right — there’s a brand-new Rhythm Heaven game,Rhythm Heaven Groove, coming to Nintendo Switch… in 2026. Nonetheless, fans are likely thrilled to have any update on any new game in a series that hasn’t had a new title since 2015 for the Nintendo 3DS.
Rhythm Heaven Groovelooks to be what it says on the tin: a head-boppin’ rhythm RPG that has players clicking to the beat to get to the next level. In true Rhythm Heaven form, the game will have tons of mini-games inside, but all of the games will test your sense of timing. You might even have to practice polyrhythms!
The game was announced at Thursday’s Nintendo Direct, which streamed live just six days before the planned Switch 2 Direct on April 2. The Nintendo Switch 2 is slated for launch within 2025, so it’s likely thatRhythm Heaven Groovewill be compatible with both the original Switch and its successor.

"No mention of a Switch 2 version, however
byOli Welsh
Nintendo has revealed a bit more aboutMetroid Prime 4: Beyond, due later this year — but made no mention of the strongly rumored possibility that there will be a Switch 2 version as well as a the planned 2025 release for the original Switch. The game’s release date remains a vague “2025.”
During Thursday’s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo showed a new trailer that revealed Samus will gain new psychic powers as she explores the jungle planet of Viewros. The powers enable Samus to manipulate magnets and doors with her mind, and even bend the trajectory of her beams.
The trailer ended with the surprise reveal of an all-new look for Samus’ iconic suit: metallic red and gunmetal gray, edged with purple highlights. Is this a… psychic suit?
The trailer showed organic-looking enemies that will attack Samus as she explores the jungle, scanning stone figures and other ancient relics to make her way forward. The origin and purpose of Samus’ new psychic powers is presented as the game’s central mystery. At one point, an alien figure says to Samus, “Chosen One, we welcome you.” At another, an old spaceship is seen entangled in the vines of the jungle.
“The threads intertwining beyond space and time are beginning to weave a new tale,” said the trailer’s narrator, gnomically.
It’s still worth keeping an eye on the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct next week, on April 2, to see if a Switch 2 version ofMetroid Prime 4: Echoesmaterializes, along with a release date.

"From House Flipper 2 to Crime Scene Cleaner, these are the best of the best
byMaddy Myers
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Spring is here, and that means it’s time for spring cleaning! No, I’m not referring to my actual home, which I guess I’m also going to clean at some point, but we aren’t going to discuss that today. I am referring, of course, to the far more soothing experience of cleaning up a virtual space in a video game. There’s just nothing quite like the sensation of moving a mop icon on top of a digital dirt pile and clicking, clicking, clicking until it all disappears. If real-life mopping were that satisfying and simple, maybe I would actually do it (instead I own thisrobot mop, which isgreat, but again, that’s not why we’re here).
You might not know it, given how often I talk aboutmy love ofElden Ringorparrying inDark Souls, but cleaning games are one of my favorite video game genres — the perfect counterpoint to a tough FromSoftware title, if I may say so. Also the perfect end to a tiring real-life day! The five games on this list have seriously soothed my brain, and now I pass them on to all of you.
Where to play:PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Windows PCDespite the title,House Flipper 2(and its predecessor,House Flipper) is not so much about flipping properties for resale as it is about doing miscellaneous cleanup jobs in a small town. Beyond brief email correspondence and cellphone calls with your boss, you never really need to interact with anybody in-game; you just go to various locations and use different cleaning implements and power tools to make total shitheaps into sparkling-clean, move-in-ready living spaces. You earn digital currency as you go, so you can unlock more tools to work even faster, but take it slow — every mission is a meditative experience worth treasuring.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Windows PCThe title of this game makes it sound like you might be some sort of official crime scene cleaner for a police department, but nope. You’re playing as a civilian who needs cash badly to help his sick daughter with expensive medical treatments, and you end up working for the mob to clean up crimes. It’s lucrative, OK? Despite the grisly title and dark premise,Crime Scene Cleaneris absolutely a comedy game, with the protagonist constantly delivering sarcastic one-liners about his predicament. Plus, the crimes requiring cleanup have often unfolded in bizarre and fun locations to explore, such as a museum filled with dinosaurs’ remains… and now, human ones.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Mac, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox OneAt first,Unpackingseems like a charming little experience in which you do the titular activity that no one enjoys doing in real life but that feels strangely satisfying in this game, perhaps due to the cute interior designs and animation style on display. Over time, though, you’ll realize there’s a story here of a specific person moving from place to place and living an entire life, reflected in the things they need to unpack at each one. The result is poignant and sweet.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Mac, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XDepending on what type of brain you have,A Little to the Left’s cleaning-oriented puzzles will either leave you frustrated or extremely satisfied… or both. This game isn’t so much about clicking on messes to make them disappear; instead it’s a series of hyper-specific object-based puzzles, most of which involve simply straightening things up. Others are more like aesthetic mind games that require you to figure out an ideal orientation for a certain set of objects (should they be ordered by size, by color, by shape…?). I couldn’t always tell what each puzzle required me to do, but for most of them, it was obvious enough and gave me the nice brain buzz when I figured it out. You can skip any puzzle you get stuck on, thank goodness.
Where to play:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XThe cleaning game to beat all cleaning games,PowerWash Simulatoris also an incredible advertisement for power washers, which are actually as fun in real life as they are in this game. Real life doesn’t have the fun crossovers that this game does, though, where you get to clean up Lara Croft’s messy mansion or Shrek’s swamp. More and more DLC packs keep on getting released, soPowerWash Simis truly the gift that keeps on giving for fans of this genre.

"Expect 30 minutes of games, but no Switch 2 talk
byMichael McWhertor
A new Nintendo Direct showcase will be streamed live on Thursday, March 27. The new Direct will focus on games coming to the original Switch, not the upcomingNintendo Switch 2, Nintendo announced Wednesday. It appears to be one of the last, if not the last, Nintendo Direct events dedicated solely to Nintendo’s current-generation console.
Thursday’s Direct will stream live at 7 a.m. PDT/10 a.m. EDT onNintendo’s official YouTube channel. The presentation will run for around 30 minutes, Nintendo said. You can watch the new Nintendo Direct in the embedded video above.
Nintendo currently has one title on its publishing slate for Switch,Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Many third-party publishers still have Switch games coming, but the existence of a new Nintendo Direct dedicated to the original Switch certainly indicates there may be more from Nintendo itself. Nintendo is rumored to have a handful of remakes and remasters for the original Switch, but maybe there will be a surprise or two as well.
Nintendo’s successor to the original Switch is expected to launch sometime in late spring or early summer. ANintendo Direct dedicated to Switch 2is coming next week, on Wednesday, April 2.

"﻿If I have to buy another fucking Joy-Con, I’m going to scream
byCharlie Hall
Halfway through October 2021, my youngest daughter, just 7 years old at the time, came to me with concern in her eyes. TheNintendo Switchwouldn’t turn on, and its last few moments of operation were concerning. Something about a download that had just completed, she said, and a button that said “update.” That was the end of the line for that particular unit, but only the beginning of my troubles with a console that would proceed to try my patience until this very day — an experience that makes me loath to considerbuying the Nintendo Switch 2.
The Hall family had been victim to a technical snafu as old as mobile devices themselves: the dreaded low-power firmware update. That’s when a device, like an iPhone or a graphics card or a $250 red-and-black plastic hunk of shit, loses power while it’s upgrading its most important layer of software. Firmware refers to the pieces of code that tell a device that it’s a device and not a 398-gram brick, and as I took the tripartite console from my daughter’s tiny little hands — where it was cradled like a dead bird — I knew that it was a total loss. But that wasn’t the worst part.
Inside that black mirror of despair were dozens of tiny, furry neighbors — herdigital friends fromAnimal Crossing: New Horizons. The newisland backupfeature had only recently been introduced, and her idiot father hadn’t yet taken the time to perform the arcane rites required to save a Nintendo Switch game to the cloud.
Her friends were all dead, of that I was sure. So, too, was the bell-selling knickknack shop that she and her older sister had built from scratch before showing it off on the Polygon Twitch channel. My house, my wife’s house, thosedamnable ladders and bridges that took weeks to build, and, of course, the peach trees that we all loved so much… none of them were ever coming back.
Ultimately, it’s my fault. I’m the user here, and it was my error. But I get to beangry at Nintendofor not making something like backing up hundreds of hours of irretrievable gameplay, shared joyfully during the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, just a little bit easier, or — dare I say it — a feature that gets turned on automatically from the start.
Everything about the Switch is a quirk, and some of them are more obnoxious than others
But Nintendo doesn’t treat the cloud like other console manufacturers do. It doesn’t treat online storefronts like other console manufacturers do, either. Or onboard storage. Or game cartridges. Or online multiplayer. Or friends lists. Or televisions, for that matter. Everything about the Switch is a quirk, and some of them are more obnoxious than others.
While having our original Nintendo Switch replaced by a refurbished one set me back pert near $120, I’ve easily spent at least that much buying additional controllers over the years. Both of the Joy-Cons that shipped with our original Switch suffered fromJoy-Con drift, something that my children suffered through wordlessly for months before I realized it.
“What is happening to Mario?” I asked one day while watching the girls play in the basement.
“Oh, that’s just how the controllers work now,” said my oldest. I was incredulous. There is no scenario where I would accept anything other than absolute obeisance from a human input device, but here my kids were making do, trying to complete nefarious jumping puzzles with a joystick that was barely capable of walking a virtual avatar in a straight line. Suffice it to say that they eventually lost the taste for piloting the tiny red plumber — especially when it took the better part of two months to get our controllers back after being repaired under the warranty.
When the next two broke, I just threw them away. It wasn’t even worth a trip to the post office for me.
Today we’re in a better place, thanks. The girls both have healthy relationships with video game consoles like the Xbox Series X, with iPhones and iPads, and with Windows PCs, as well as a catalog of games that each of them can call home. But they remain literally afraid of the Nintendo Switch, a console that let them down multiple times for various reasons. I can’t even coax them to bring it along for road trips.
They won’t forget that experience, and I won’t either. And that’s why I’m waving off the Nintendo Switch 2. I’ve got enough to worry about in the year of our lord 2025 that risking a visitation from another wonky portable console isn’t even on my radar.

"Secret Door’s digital tabletop game is almost here
byMichael McWhertor
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Sunderfolk, the ambitious co-op tactical adventure game built on a love of tabletop games, is coming to consoles and PC on April 23, developer Secret Door and publisher Dreamhaven announced Tuesday. Curious players can try outSunderfolkwith a first look demo through Nvidia’s GeForce Now game-streaming service from March 25 through April 7.
Secret Door’s debut title is inspired by tabletop games likeGloomhavenand Dungeons & Dragons, and uses smart devices as a controller, à la Jackbox games.Sunderfolkis designed to be played by one to four players on a large TV screen or monitor, with the game itself running on a PC or console. Players interact with the game throughSunderfolk’s dedicated controller app, which will be free to download for Android and iOS devices.
Sunderfolk’s creators hope their game will bring players together by bypassing the complexity and setup times required for learning new tabletop games. “Our goal withSunderfolkis to leverage modern technology tomake game night something everyone can enjoy,” said Chris Sigaty, studio head of Secret Door and veteran of StarCraft and Warcraft game development.
InSunderfolk, players choose from one of six anthropomorphic heroes: an Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, or Rogue. Each character has their own strategic role and passive ability, and can be customized with weapons, armor, trinkets, and skills. Character abilities are represented by cards; players personalize their deck of skill cards as they progress through the adventure to create a well-rounded party. It is an incredibly fun and easy game to get into, and a great social experience, based on myhands-on time withSunderfolk.
Sunderfolkwill be available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Steam), and Xbox Series X on April 23. The game costs $49.99.
In addition toSunderfolk’s release date announcement, Dreamhaven and internal studio Moonshot Games also revealed a new project,Wildgate, a crew-based first-person shooter with ship combat.
Dreamhaven also announced Tuesday that it will publish competitive auto battlerMechabellum, which is currently available on Steam.

"Its Odyssey 3D is, by far, its most interesting monitor of 2025
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
It’s new monitor season, apparently, as Samsung is gearing up to launch its 2025 gaming monitors. Its lineup is both similar toandway more interesting than other manufacturers’. If you’re in the market for an upgrade, or not quite sure yet, Samsung is hoping to tempt you into reserving a pre-order by offering a$50 off couponthat’s redeemable for its new gaming monitors. To be clear, you won’t be putting any money down by reserving. This just gets you the coupon in case you decide to pre-order one.
As far as what the lineup includes, there’s a sleek 27-inch 4K OLED monitor with a 240 Hz refresh rate that I have my eyes on. This display was announced atCES 2025, and should be similar to theAlienware AW2725Qthat I tested out. Even more unique is Samsung’s27-inch Odyssey 3D gaming monitor, which utilizes eye-tracking tech to make visuals appear like they’re popping out of the screen. Think of it like the top screen of the Nintendo 3DS, but with 2D-to-3D conversion tech that’s significantly more advanced. Only games supported by Samsung’s Reality Hub app will work in 3D, and it won’t display DRM content in 3D. Also, it’ll only work with Nvidia graphics cards.
Prices and release dates for these monitors haven’t been shared yet.

"The console’s key games tell the story of a changing Nintendo
byOli WelshandMichael McWhertor
What games do you think of when you think of Nintendo’s Switch? There are several obvious answers; Nintendo’s in-house studios never fail to leave their mark on a system with a handful of brilliant games. Yet one of the most notable things about the Switch, as it prepares to cede the limelight toSwitch 2after eight years on the market, is that it has been less software-dependent than, perhaps, any Nintendo console since the NES.
Of course the Switch wouldn’t be the success it has been without its biggest games. In its first year,The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandMario Kart 8 Deluxehelped the console find a massive audience. Yet both started as games for Wii U, Nintendo’sleastsuccessful platform. The Switch really was a case of a console that carved out a space for itself by arriving with the right form factor at the right time. The games that worked well on it found a console that was uniquely capable of adapting itself to suit them and helping them find players, rather than the other way around.
The Switch began a new era for Nintendo as a platform holder that began to look a little more like the others, even if it continued to play by its own rules. The games that defined the console aren’t necessarilythe bestor the biggest. Shockingly, they don’t include a mainline Mario platform game. They’re the games that described what the Switch meant to players, and how it changed Nintendo — and the rest of the game industry.
Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ unprecedented success on Switch was a mixed blessing. It was in no small part a blockbuster hit due to the devastating worldwide pandemic that forced us indoors and into isolation around its release.New Horizonsgave many of its players a taste of connection and community when they couldn’t physically meet up with friends, family, and colleagues.
ButNew Horizonswas more than just a digital alternative to real-world socializing. It was a place where we made new virtual friends, found comfort in routine, and exercised control over our lives, albeit imaginary ones lived on our own private islands. The coziness of Animal Crossing was a refuge during a difficult stretch.
That’s not to say thatNew Horizonswasn’t an enjoyable evolution of the Animal Crossing experience on its own merits. It was. There was joy to be found in building and customizing a home — and even in paying it off — and exploiting the game’s quirks to amass riches. Millions of us delighted in daily interactions with Isabelle, Blathers, and the Nook boys, and waited with anticipation as new villagers visited our town, praying that we’d pull a “dreamy.” It was a brief taste of video game monoculture, fueled by the state of the world, and a defining moment in the Switch’s success. —Michael McWhertor
Breath of the Wildhas become so inextricably linked with the Switch that it’s easy to forget it was also released on Wii U, and in fact was announced as a Wii U game before we even knew what the Switch was. Nintendo’s decision to pivot it to a cross-gen release gifted the Switch what might be the greatest launch title of all time.
Beyond that, it marked a creative turning point for Nintendo as a game developer, and sent a clear message that the Switch was ushering in a new era for the company. The game’s bold, nonlinear, systemic design was a huge departure for the Zelda series, synthesizing many influences from beyond Nintendo’s Miyamoto-worshipping bubble into something that was distinctive and original, but also felt like it had been made in a world whereSkyrimandMinecrafthad happened. The sequel,Tears of the Kingdom, took things even further by giving players an astonishing, almost game-breaking level of creative freedom.
Breath of the Wildturned one of Nintendo’s oldest franchises into its most modern. It also outsold every mainline Mario game on the Switch, a first for the Zelda series. It was quite clear that Nintendo would never be the same again. —Oli Welsh
Switch was a platform for second chances. Many of Nintendo’s games that failed to break through on the poorly selling Wii U found new life on Switch, including the Splatoon franchise,Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, andCaptain Toad: Treasure Tracker. But none of those ports and rereleases have enjoyed the incredible success ofMario Kart 8 Deluxe, a souped-up version of the 2014 kart racer that has since gone on to outsell its predecessor eight times over.
Mario Kart 8 DeluxeistheSwitch game; two out of every five Switch owners have a copy. It was so successful for Nintendo that, five years afterDeluxelaunched, the company released 48 more courses and eight additional characters as DLC. In an equally important move, Nintendo included that DLC as part of its Nintendo Switch Online subscription, part of the company’s plan to offer more than just multiplayer connectivity and classic games.
It’s telling that the first game Nintendo has shown for Switch 2 is a new Mario Kart.Deluxenot only brought in all-new fans of the Mario Kart franchise, it helped get the storied franchise back on, ahem, track. —MM
Let’s be honest; the Switch is not the ideal platform to playThe Witcher 3. Nintendo’s console is manifestly underpowered for a game that was cutting-edge in 2015 and remained a technical showpiece when Nintendo’s console launched two years later. At the time, Nintendo was also not a natural home for such bloody, sexy, world-weary fare.
This is precisely why the Switch port ofThe Witcher 3is so important. It’s significant that anyone tried to make it, and incredible thatthey pulled it off. Nintendo had long left the world of AAA gaming behind, and even during the success of the Wii, big publishers tended not to bring their marquee titles over because they were too technically demanding or aimed at a perceived different market. When the Wii U flopped, many third parties deserted Nintendo altogether.
The Switch, however, was not just a huge sales success — with its appealing form factor and the undeniableBreath of the Wild, it had thrust Nintendo back into the hearts of the core gaming community. All of a sudden, third parties were clamoring to be part of it, and a few studios began to specialize in cramming AAA titles onto Switch’s aging mobile chipset and into the tight confines of its game cards. A wave of “miracle” ports began with2016’sDoom, and of these, the 2019 port ofThe Witcher 3was the white whale. Not long after, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X widened the technical gulf again to a point where the ports would start to dry up — but you can expect the floodgates to reopen on Switch 2. —OW
“Everyone is here!” Nintendo promised withSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate. The game maker not only kept that promise, it overdelivered with one of the most impressive expansions to any Nintendo franchise ever. In addition to stacking the game’s core roster with 69 playable characters, including every fighter who’d ever appeared in a Smash Bros. game and surprising newcomers like Castlevania’s Simon and Metroid’s Ridley, the game’s developers pulled off what felt like impossible licensing deals. Banjo and Kazooie. Kingdom Hearts’ Sora.Final Fantasy 7’s Sephiroth.Minecraft’s Steve and Alex.
The massive growth of the Switch and the fervor for more Super Smash Bros. seemed to feed off of each other. Led by tireless game makerMasahiro Sakurai, the yearslong development ofSuper Smash Bros. Ultimateresulted in the series’ biggest entry yet, so gargantuan that one has to question if Nintendo and Sakurai can ever top it.
And whileSuper Smash Bros. Ultimatewas a major step forward for the franchise,Nintendo’s approach to esportsand its games being featured at non-Nintendo-sanctioned events hasn’t evolved much during the Switch era. —MM
Who would have seen Labo coming? Nintendo’s DIY “build-and-play” line of accessories let Switch owners craft cardboard “Toy-Con” versions of real-world items like a 13-key piano, fishing rod, and motorbike — and evena VR headset— for an all-new play experience that evoked the wild accessories released during the Wii era.
In retrospect, it’s almost shocking that Nintendo Labo arrived just 13 months after the release of the Switch. What now feels like a late-life cycle attempt to reinvigorate the Switch with a gimmick was just another moment of unexpected innovation from Nintendo.
While interest in Labo died out fairly quickly (building the Toy-Cons was 90% of the fun), it was a reminder of the uniqueness and adaptability of the Switch Joy-Cons to act as more than just conveniently detachable controllers — an idea that Nintendo would later explore with the similarly creative and unexpectedRing Fit Adventure. —MM
It might seem strange to chooseScarletandVioletto represent Pokémon on this list. Of the Switch’s mainline Pokémon titles,SwordandShieldwere better received by fans and even sold better (by a hair’s breadth). But it’s precisely because of theirperformance woesanduninspired designthatScarletandVioletare, sadly, more symptomatic of the Switch era.
The runaway success of the Switch always represented a risk that Nintendo might rush too keenly to capitalize, letting its famous quality control standards slip in the process. As far as its internal studios were concerned, iron discipline was maintained, but Nintendo didn’t have as much success in keeping its partners at The Pokémon Company and developer Game Freak in check.
The Switch saw 12 Pokémon games released in six years, including four (soon to be five) major Game Freak titles; the developer releasedScarletandVioletand the superiorPokémon Legends: Arceusin thesame year. It was just too much, andScarletandVioletbore the signs of an exhausted studio trapped in a content grind. You really can have too much of a good thing. —OW
Pairing the greatest video game of all time with the hot genre of the moment forTetris 99felt both like a uniquely classic Nintendo move and surprisingly forward-thinking for the company. While other game makers chased variations on the battle royale shooter, Nintendo and developer Arika took a different approach, resulting in a frenetically fun, all-ages take on what is traditionally a violent genre.
Shadow-dropped as a bonus perk for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in 2019, the release ofTetris 99brought fresh buzz to the Switch. Its success spawned even more variations on the battle royale formula from Nintendo, withSuper Mario Bros. 35andF-Zero 99. (Arika also created a99-player battle royale version of Pac-Manfor Bandai Namco.)
Tetris 99’s most lasting impact, however, may be its role as a value add for NSO subscribers. Nintendo, having already mined most of its back catalog from the NES and SNES era forNintendo Switch Online’s classic games offerings, will need more games likeTetris 99to keep Switch 2 owners interested and subscribed to the service. —MM
The Switch era has run parallel with a surge in interest in Japanese-made RPGs, and it’s very much not a coincidence. Japanese publishers and developers naturally flooded to the console, which had huge sales in their home market, at the same time as the overseasanime boomcreated just the right cultural environment for these games to have an international moment. Nintendo saw the opportunity and lent a hand, often shining a light on Japanese-made games in its Direct broadcasts, and occasionally stepping in to co-publish games like Square Enix’s gorgeous throwbackOctopath Traveler.
Nintendo was well placed to benefit from this snowball effect with some of its own games, including the Xenoblade Chronicles series. But the ultimate example was 2019’sFire Emblem: Three Houses. Intelligent Systems’ tactical RPG series had always been beloved within its specific niche, but the audience the Switch had amassed for anime-flavored RPGs turned it into something bigger — a sort of viral hit, powered by players’ obsession over the game’s characters and relationships and its Harry Potter-style system of rival school houses.Three Housesshowed how the Switch was, and remains, one of the most fandom-friendly platforms around. —OW
While major third parties took a little longer to turn their oil tankers in Nintendo’s direction, the indie developer scene saw the potential of Nintendo’s machine almost instantly and rushed to take advantage. For several years, it was common for indies to release their hits on Steam and Switch first, and worry about PlayStation and Xbox later. The Switch’s humble tech was no barrier to these games, and the immediacy of their designs often suited portable play perfectly.
The two games that most symbolize the Switch’s indie era are 2018’sHollow Knightand 2020’sHades— both fantastically refined action games in popular genres that are tricky to get right (Metroidvania and roguelike, respectively). Both found huge audiences, thanks in part to the Switch’s enormous reach. Of the two, it’s probably Team Cherry’sHollow Knightthat is more closely associated with the Switch — if only because its long, long-awaited sequelSilksongwas first announced at a Nintendo Direct, and the increasingly desperate anticipation of new info about the game ahead of every Direct since has become a meme. —OW

"Nintendo’s been flirting with big multiplayer numbers this generation
byMichael McWhertor
This story was first published in Switchboard, a newsletter from Polygon that delivers all the latest Switch 2 news, reporting, and rumors directly to your inbox.Sign up hereto get it weekly.
Former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata passed before the Switch launched in 2017, but he left the company with a vision that it’s beginning to make good on — one that will be crucial to the Switch 2.
“Mr. Iwata was the head of development, so he put a lot of thought and time into Switch,” veteran game designer and Nintendo fellow Shigeru Miyamoto toldTimein 2017. “[T]he idea of Nintendo Switch being a device you can take out and anywhere, and the idea of it being a system that really allows networking and communicating with people, I think that’s something Mr. Iwata put a lot of emphasis on.”
The originalSwitch was pitched partly on the idea of bringing people together to play, with locally played games like1-2-SwitchandSnipperclips. But Nintendo clearly has bigger multiplayer ambitions, as some of its recent game output shows.
Despite its creativity and innovation, Nintendo can often seem behind the curve when adopting new technologies or game ideas. Nintendo abandoned the technological console arms race in 2006 with the launch of the underpowered Wii, proving it doesn’t need to win on graphics. The company instead prefers to follow the “Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology” philosophy — creating new ideas using mature, reliable technology — that Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi described in his bookGunpei Yokoi Game Kan.
Nintendo has also been notoriously slower than its competitors in adopting online multiplayer features in its games, sometimes relying on clunky solutions like Friend Codes and theNintendo Switch Online smartphone appto bring players together. Meeting up with friends inAnimal Crossing: New Horizonswas a notoriouslypainful process.
But Nintendo has been keeping pace with a multiplayer trend during the Switch era, experimenting with ever larger numbers of players.Tetris 99,F-Zero 99, andSuper Mario Bros. 35— these competitive multiplayer games borrowed from popular last-player-standing games (PUBG,Fortnite) to modernize classic 8- and 16-bit franchises with huge player counts.
Nintendo likewise bumped up player counts in party gameSuper Mario Party Jamboree, which featureda 20-player mode called Koopathlon, andEverybody 1-2-Switch!which let up to 100 players get into the action through smartphone support. Even a flagship game likeSuper Mario Bros. Wondersupported online lobbies for up to 12 players (andborrowed some smart multiplayer ideasfrom the Dark Souls franchise).
We’re already seeing some of that in thenew Mario Kart game for Switch 2, which looks like it will double the number of simultaneous online competitors seen in previous Mario Kart entries from 12 to 24.
Some of these massively multiplayer games have arrived near the end of the Switch’s life cycle, suggesting that Nintendo is getting started with its massively multiplayer ambitions.
Last year, the company started theNintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program, a mysterious beta that Nintendo developed to “test the boundaries of mass multiplayer functionality and gameplay on our servers.” How Nintendo will implement its MMO-like ideas remains to be seen, but there are certainly strong Nintendo franchise candidates that could benefit from introducing higher player counts.
Bringing even bigger audiences together to experience the joy of play through Nintendo IP like Super Mario Bros. and Animal Crossing — as well as brand-new experiences — could be the culmination of Iwata’s vision.

"It’s been a wild ride for Hand-Drawn Game Guides
byMatt Leone
It’s been a wild ride for Hand-Drawn Game Guides
byMatt Leone
Back in 2021, Philip Summers launcheda Kickstarter campaignfor Hand-Drawn Game Guides, a series of books that resembled traditional strategy guides, apart from the fact that they were all illustrated by Summers. The campaign was a hit, generating over $300,000 in pledges, but like a number of fan projects utilizing game company IPs, it was pulled before the countdown ended.
He ended up changing plans due to legal concerns, going on to work on other projects and releasing the planned guides from the campaignas free downloads. From the outside, that seemed like the new path for Hand-Drawn Game Guides.
But then, in January 2025, Summers returned to Kickstarter with a surprise announcement — he’d struck a deal with Capcom to make an officially licensed entry in the series:Hand-Drawn Game Guides: Mega Man. That campaign was also a success, and Summers is now working on the book and intending to release it later this year.
In an effort to spotlight game-related books and documentaries, Polygon is running an email interview series with the people behind them. We previously connected with Julian Rignall about his not-quite-an-autobiographyThe Games of a Lifetime, Paul Vogel about his Housemarque documentaryThe Name of the Game, Lewis Packwood about his obscure game hardware bookCurious Video Game Machines, and Oliver Harper about hisStreet Fighter 2documentaryHere Comes a New Challenger. Below, Summers discusses how the Mega Man project came about and where he wants to take Hand-Drawn Game Guides in the future.
Polygon: When you launched the Kickstarter campaign, a lot of people were surprised that the book was licensed by Capcom. How did that come about behind the scenes?
Philip Summers:Lucas Thomas from Nintendo Force Magazine/NF Publishing was a fan of the original Hand-Drawn Game Guides campaign and basically remembered me all these years later! He has been expanding into book publishing and wanted to work on a property officially. With some work he was able to get the license from Capcom to create Mega Man books and asked if I would be willing to resurrect the Hand-Drawn Game Guides concept and do it legit this time. We still needed to pitch the book to them for approval, so we created a sequence of pages to present. They liked what they saw and we were able to move ahead from there.
There’s a long history of game books running into legal issues with copyright holders. Do you have any advice for others looking to do similar projects?
Unfortunately I don’t have any real advice on how to go about jumping through some of these loopholes. In the years since my original campaign shut down, I’ve come to find that different companies respond to different types of projects and they all have their own reasons. What I can tell you is that if you plan on launching something like a Kickstarter where your funding totals are public and the project heavily features IP that you don’t have the rights to, it’s highly likely it will get shut down.
In the Mega Man Kickstarter campaign, you mentioned the possibility of doing more Mega Man books after this one. What’s the status of that?
At this point it’s too early to tell. I think we’ll have a much better understanding of where we stand once the book is completed and shipped. Assuming people are happy with it, and Capcom is happy with it, I think it’s fair to say we’ll be able to move onto the next one, which the obvious choice isMega Man 2. Though I really loveMega Man Xtoo!
Long-term, what are your plans for Hand-Drawn Game Guides? Is the idea to get official licenses for other games and make this a regular thing?
For sure! I have a whole list of games I’d love to work on, and if we end up putting out a great product we’re hopeful more companies will be receptive to letting us give one of their classic games the Hand-Drawn Game Guides treatment. This is a side gig for me, so I can only work so quickly, but who knows maybe that could change one day too.

"Just a little one. As a treat
byOli Welsh
According toone very annoyed Ubisoft investor, citing a private report by investor service Mergermarket, Ubisoft has been holding secret talks with Microsoft, Electronic Arts, and other publishers who are interested in acquiring some of the troubled publisher’s franchises.
This is interesting in the context of Ubisoft’s current struggles; the floundering publisher hasn’t had a hit in a while, is losing the confidence of investors, and is “exploring strategic options” that include going private and breaking up the company. Thelatest reportssuggest Ubisoft is looking to create a new entity that will hold on to some core intellectual property. Things are so bad that even a stellar launch forAssassin’s Creed Shadowswon’t necessarily fix it all.
It’s also an interesting prompt for assessing the Ubisoft catalog. What properties does Ubisoft have that are worth buying, but that Ubisoft itself can do without? What can Ubisoft sell without throwing its soul into the bargain?
So, I propose a little thought exercise. You are Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming. You have spent many billions acquiring publishers like Bethesda and Activision Blizzard, and studios like Obsidian and Double Fine, in a seeming attempt to own all of gaming (if not to actually sell Xbox consoles). But you are not quite satiated yet, and the spectacle of a floundering French publisher conducting a yard sale of storied franchises is too tempting to resist. Maybe just a little one? As a treat?
What will you choose? For the purposes of this exercise, we’ll assume that Assassin’s Creed is not for sale; it’s Ubisoft’s flagship, and without it the publisher might as well just close up shop. To a lesser extent, the same goes for Far Cry. And we’ll also assume that all the Tom Clancy games are off the table. It’s true that some parts of the Clancyverse seem ripe for the picking — for example, Splinter Cell, a fondly remembered stealth action series (with strong links to Xbox) that Ubisoft is currently doing nothing with. But it seems unlikely that the Clancy estate would be interested in breaking these properties up — and there’s no way Ubisoft is letting go of Rainbow Six, which is one of its most reliable cash cows.
So, what’s left in the shop window to tempt a browsing Microsoft exec?
Well now. This one is quite tempting, isn’t it? A largely dormant action-adventure franchise, recently revived by a quality Metroidvania, but with a major reboot wallowing in development hell. You never really had anything to match Uncharted with. This could be it, maybe… although corporate might not like the optics of an American giant swooping in to acquire the most famous Middle Eastern gaming icon. Especially in… the current climate.
You never really had a platforming mascot to speak of, but this one is just soprofoundlyFrench it’s impossible to imagine it as a standard-bearer for the greenest, most American game console. Respectfully, it’s a hard pass.
The same ought to apply to Ubisoft’s funny little rabbit guys, but if you squint, they look an awful lot like Minions. And Minions arehugewith kids. Family franchises are a bit of a blind spot for Xbox. On the other hand, the only decent games the Rabbids have ever been in also starred Mario, and Furukawa-san over at Nintendo probably won’t be into it. (You need to call him, though, about putting every single one of your franchises on Switch 2 — it never hurts to ask!)
This is a multiplayer game you’ve never heard of about medieval warriors beating each other up. But there’s a note on the sticker that Ubisoft reckons it has35 million players? That can’t be right. Have your team pull the data on that one. Might be worth it, if it’s cheap. Who doesn’t like swords?
You actuallydohave Forza Horizon at home. So it’s a pass.
Oh man, you remember loving the original one on PlayStation. And didn’t they do that wacky one that was all about a ghost policeman possessing cars? That was cool. You have enough driving games, but this one’s a little bit different, a bit funky. Ask if they’ll throw it in with something else.
[You have a Kinect trauma flashback and curl up in a ball on the floor.]
You didn’t spend $7.5 billion acquiring The Elder Scrolls for nothing. Except, apparently you did, because the next one is never coming out, and Obsidian could probably churn out three Might and Magic games for you by next week. Still though… nah.
Somehow, despite buying half the game industry, you don’t really have any GTA-style open-world games, and to Ubi’s credit, Watch Dogs got quite good; you remember thinking the last one,Legion, was pretty fun. If theyreallywon’t let you have Assassin’s Creed (note to self: up offer by $0.5-1 billion), you could see yourself owning this. But then… it’s not actually GTA or Assassin’s Creed, is it? It’s not even Far Cry.
Nowyou’re talking. A franchise that was maybe never actually popular, but that has ascended into fanboy myth status. A directionless vaporware project that’s been stuck in development hell for somewhere between 10 and 20 years. But you couldsaveit, Phil. Think of the gamer cred! Think how cool your T-shirt reveal would be! It’s just so Xbox. It’s just soyou. Where’s Satya’s company card?

"An unused 60 fps mode raises a lot of questions
byIan Walker
A programmer poking around the newly releasedXenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Editionon Switch has discovered references toan unused 60 fps modein the game’s code, fueling speculation of a potential upgrade on Switch 2 when Nintendo’s next console rolls around later this year.
Switch modder MasaGratoR shared a screenshot of theXenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Editioncode to X on March 19. Henotedthat this 60 fps mode is “implemented only partially” because it “causes weird issues” when activated.
“Gameplay is rendered every second frame, so even though it outputs 60 FPS you get in fact 30 usable frames,” MasaGratoRaddedwhen asked about the issues presented by the higher framerate. “Cutscenes sometimes are working fine, sometimes some objects are jittering like hardcoded to be 30 FPS, sometimes it’s again every second frame rendered.”
While it’s entirely possible this code is just leftover evidence of the developers at Monolith Soft trying to get 60 fps working on the original Switch, the Switch 2 specssuggested by leaksshould be more than enough to handle such a framerate boost. Nintendo has yet to say whether or not backwards-compatible Switch games will be upgraded on Switch 2.
Xenoblade Chronicles Xfirst launched on Wii U in 2015, somehow cramming a massive, roleplaying adventure into a tiny space andgarnering praiseas one of the best games on the doomed console.Definitive Edition, available on Switch since March 20, features improved visuals and new story content.

"Its original title was ‘F*ck This Place’
bySusana Polo
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
I Hate This Place, the 2022 horror series from writer Kyle Starks and artist Artyom Toplin, wasone of my favorite comicsthat year. And now, as revealed in the Future Games Show, it’s a neon-colored isometric open-world survival horror game that I’ll probably be too chicken to play.
I Hate This Place— originally announced asFuck This Place, which is a way better title, but, like, I get it — starred Gabby and Trudy, a lesbian couple who see the cattle ranch they just inherited as their ticket to financial stability. Unfortunately, the family ranch is secretly a locus for every horror genre simultaneously: hauntings, alien abductions, a Strange Entity in the Forest, Secret Knife Killer Hiding Among You, the Place Won’t Let You Leave, Survivalist Cult Apocalypse, and so on.I Hate This Placewas kind of like… “Fast Car” meetsThe Cabin in the Woods.
The new game adaptation is being developed by Bloober Team (2019’sBlair Witch,The Medium), under the company’s new horror imprint Broken Mirror Games, and appears to focus on an original story set in the comic’s titular Place, potentially a prequel. “Players take on the role of Elena, whose fight for survival begins when she unwittingly awakens a malevolent force,” says a joint news release from Bloober Team andI Hate This Place(the comic)’s Skybound Entertainment. The game will feature “retro ‘80s comic book aesthetics,” where the original comic was set in the modern day.
“Each location is lovingly crafted to tell its own disturbing story through stylish visuals that blur the line between reality and nightmare in a world where everything wants you dead.” According to the news release, gameplay will feature “tense gunfights and melee combat that rewards ingenuity over brute force, all while crafting essential tools to survive the harsh and unforgiving wilderness long enough to reach safehouses before nightfall, with the day & night cycle having an impact on gameplay dynamics.”
I Hate This Placeis currently set to launch in Q4 of 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch. It’s available to wishlist onSteamand theEpic Games Store, and you could pick up the comic that inspired it onAmazon,Bookshop, or at your local store.

"The System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Edition comes to PC and consoles June 26
byAlice Jovanée
System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Edition(formerly titledSystem Shock 2: Enhanced Edition) will be arriving on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch on June 26, courtesy of Nightdive Studios. Announced at the Future Game Show Spring Showcase, the25th Anniversary Editionbrings a fresh coat of paint to the classic 1999 sci-fi horror game and will be the first classic System Shock title playable on consoles.
This effort isn’t nearly as extensive as the excellentSystem Shockfrom 2023, butSystem Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Editionstill features a massive graphics overhaul with updated textures and ultrawide support, in addition to new audio recordings and a litany of quality-of-life improvements to make the game more palatable for modern audiences. Nightdive took a similar approach to its Enhanced Edition of the originalSystem Shock, turning the previously obtuse title into what many consider the ideal way to play the 1994 game.
Over the past 25 years,System Shock 2has received aremarkable amount of community supportin the form of patches, higher-resolution textures, and other fixes. These mods offer an excellent version ofSystem Shock 2, but the process of getting everything running properly makes the experience relatively hostile to new players. The25th Anniversary Editionintegrates many of these improvements while optimizing aspects ofSystem Shock 2that haven’t been touched since 1999.System Shock 2is one of my favorite games of all time, and I’m excited for a new generation of players to experience the maiden voyage of the Von Braun when the game comes out in June.

"New Switch, new Animal Crossing?
byNicole Carpenter
It’s been exactly five years since Nintendo releasedAnimal Crossing: New Horizons,the best-selling Animal Crossing game in Nintendo’s history. In fact, it’s one of the Nintendo Switch’smost popular games ever, too, having sold nearly 48 million copies. It’s no wonder that people are already thinking about what’s next for the franchise, especially given the upcoming release ofNintendo’s next generation console.
Nintendo hasn’t said a thing about the future of the franchise,aside from the closure ofAnimal Crossing: Pocket Campand the release of itsAnimal Crossing: Pocket Camp Completeversion.New Horizonshasn’t gotten amajor update since 2021 and theHappy Home ParadiseDLC and its subsequent free update. Events continue, andsmaller updates were released later, but otherwise, there’s been little or no new content to show.
We can look back to Nintendo’s release schedule for the franchise for guidance. The firstAnimal Crossingwas released in 2001, followed up byAnimal Crossing: Wild Worldin 2005 — a five year gap.Animal Crossing: City Folkcame later, in 2008. AfterCity Folk,Animal Crossing: New Leafwas released in 2012 — again, five years.New LeafandNew Horizonshave the biggest gap of 8 years, from 2012 to 2020 whenNew Horizonswas released. Notably,New Horizonsdebuted several years into the Nintendo Switch’s lifespan. It makes sense that timing between games would increase as technology becomes more complex and games become bigger, but I think it’s unlikely we’ll see a gap that big betweenNew Horizonsand whatever is next.
Nintendo has its Switch 2 presentation set for April 2, and early Animal Crossing fans are hoping there’s a mention of Animal Crossing at the event. I would be surprised; the focus of the event is the console itself — and a new Animal Crossing game would likely overshadow so much of it all. If anything, maybe a small teaser with Tom Nook wondering about his next business venture.

"A Switch 2 sports announcement
byMichael McWhertor
Get ready to see a lot of Nintendo logos this summer, especially if you’re a fan of Major League Baseball. The Seattle Mariners announced Thursday that they’ve partnered with Nintendo as the team’s “first-ever official jersey sleeve partner.” That means that the Nintendo logo and theNintendo Switch 2logo will be featured on Mariners players’ sleeves, starting March 27.
Nintendo’s “racetrack” logo will appear on Mariners’ home jerseys, while the (much beefier) Switch 2 logo will appear on the team’s away jerseys. According to the Mariners, that will make the Seattle-based team the first in the MLB to feature different marks for home and away games.
“Nintendo and the Mariners have been inextricably linked since 1992,” Seattle Mariners president of business operations Kevin Martinez said in a statement. Martinez is referring to when Redmond, Wash.-based Nintendo of America purchased the Mariners in the early ’90s. (Nintendo sold its stake in the team in 2016.) “Now, each time the Mariners take the field, our jersey sleeves will help serve as a reminder of all that Nintendo of America has done for the Northwest community and the team.”
Logos of video game companies appearing on U.S.-based sports teams is incredibly rare. While gaming brands are commonplace in sports racing circles andin European football leagues, Seattle is something of an exception. Another local team, Seattle Sounders FC, featured an Xbox logo on its jerseys from 2009 to 2016.
Advertisements on MLB jerseys were all-but forbidden before before 2022. The league’s 2022-2027 collective bargaining agreement allows for a small shoulder patch with a corporate logo or image on one sleeve of players’ uniforms and batting helmets.
You can see the Seattle Mariners’ new Nintendo branding next week, when the team hosts the Athletics on opening day.
Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to launch sometime this summer. More details will be revealed in aNintendo Direct dedicated on Switch 2on April 2.

"The GOG Preservation Program is growing with a solid list of inductees, including classic titles like Silent Hill 4: The Room, Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption, Fallout 2, Deus Ex, and more.

The PC digital storefrontdetailedhow it planned to expand its retro-gaming-focused service yesterday, providing fans with a lineup of games it has committed to support for the foreseeable future. It’s a list of 26 titles thatGOG sayswill “remain playable in their best versions” that players can safely assume they’ll have access to for years to come.
Silent Hill 4: The Room is one title that will benefit from the GOG Preservation Program in more ways than one. In addition to securing its future, GOG says the entry’s status with the service means it comes with “missing content that was never available on PC before.” This includes the reintroduction of Hauntings, which spruce up that iconic Silent Hill atmosphere with spooky effects, such as flickering lamps and possessed telephones. Modern controller support has also been added.
F.E.A.R. Platinum, which waspromised last month, arrives as an especially nice addition, too, as its original developer, Monolith Productions, wasshuttered by Warner Bros. last month. As more studio closures occur and the industry leans toward a digital future, it’s a perfect example of what GOG aims to accomplish with the Preservation Program.
You can see the March 2025 additions to the GOG Preservation Program, along with discounts as part of the currentSpring Sale, below.
The GOG Preservation Program is a relatively new initiative from the CD Projekt Red-owned storefront that serves as the company’s commitment to keep a selection of games up-to-date and available for PC players. More than 100 games are supported through the program, and judging by today’s announcement, the list will only continue to grow.
""The GOG Preservation Program is our commitment to preserving gaming history,"" GOGsaid at the time of its reveal late last year. ""Through the program, players can trust that their games will always be up to date and ready to run on current and future PC setups.
""Whether it’s manuals, DLCs, or missing features, we’re offering the most complete version possible, backed by GOG’s tech support and offline installers, so you can safeguard these classics for years to come.""

"Speculation thatStarfieldwill soon be confirmed for release on PlayStation 5 ramped up over the weekend after fans spotted a PlayStation logo on Bethesda’s official Creations website.

The logo was attached to a work-in-progress ship decals Creation for Starfield, and although the Creation was removed, fans are speculating that Bethesda’s so-far PC and Xbox-only sci-fi game is soon set for PS5.
Thoughts inevitably turn to whether Bethesda plans a significant content update, possibly even a new expansion, to coincide with Starfield’s seemingly inevitable release on PS5. There’s been little to shout about when it comes to Starfield in recent months, following the launch of the poorly receivedShattered Space expansion. Bethesda parent company Microsoft is expected to hold another summer showcase this year, as it has done in recent years, and that event may be the right time and place to learn more about all things Starfield.
Bethesda itself has said it has ""exciting things"" planned for Starfield this year, amid growing discontent from players about a lack of communication and updates. In June 2024,Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supportingStarfield, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. In an interview withYouTube channel MrMattyPlays, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”
Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new intellectual property in years, and its first mainline single-player game since Microsoft bought parent company ZeniMax Media in March 2021. IGN’sStarfield reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist.”
In January,Microsoft’s gaming boss Phil Spencer refused to rule out Starfield coming out on PS5.Starfield and MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were both reported as being considered for PS5 as far back as March 2024. Indy ended up confirmed for PS5 with a spring 2025 release window, a few months after its release on PC and Xbox Series X and S. But Starfield is yet to be confirmed for PS5, although Spencer's comments certainly suggested it was on the cards.
A number of Xbox games are currently available on PS5, including Rare’s Sea of Thieves, Tango Gameworks’ Hi-Fi Rush, and Obsidian’s Grounded and Pentiment. Microsoft already publishes Minecraft games on PlayStation consoles, among many other platforms, and is set to publish Doom: The Dark Ages and Ninja Gaiden 4 on PS5 later this year. Playground’s Forza Horizon 5 is also confirmed as coming to PS5 soon. There are even reports thatMicrosoft is finally ready to release Halo on PlayStation after decades of Xbox exclusivity.
Spencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.
“We run a business,”Spencer said in August last year. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.
“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”
It’s a busy time for the 450-person Bethesda Game Studios, which currently operates five teams: Starfield; Elder Scrolls 6; Fallout 76; mobile; and external development partnerships.

"There is enormous pressure onAssassin's Creed Shadowsto do well for Ubisoft globally after a number of delays and the sales failure of last year’sStar Wars Outlaws. Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number ofhigh-profile flops,layoffs,studio closures, andgame cancellationsin the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release.

Things have got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family isreportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investorson a buyout deal that would let it preserve control of the company's intellectual property.
So, the video game world is watching Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ early performance closely for signs of its success — or failure. So far, Ubisoft has yet to announce a sales figure, but has saidAssassin's Creed Shadows hit 2 million players just two days after launch, surpassing the launches of both Origins and Odyssey.
There’s also a lot of attention on Shadows’ Steam concurrents, which are being compared to those of other triple-A single-player games that recently released, as well as previous Assassin’s Creed games on Valve’s platform.
Shadows became the most-played Assassin's Creed game ever on Steam over the weekend with 64,825 peak concurrent players, although it’s worth noting that it was the first game in the series to launch day-one there since 2018's Odyssey. BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardsaw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.
It’s hard to make a call on whether Shadows is below, meeting, or exceeding Ubisoft’s expectations without knowing what those expectations were. But a source from within Ubisoft, who revealed an internal email reviewed by IGN, has helped us better understand the game’s first weekend performance.
Here’s what we’ve found out: Shadows delivered the second-highest day-one sales revenue in the franchise’s history, behind only 2020’s Valhalla, which launched across the last and current generation of consoles and benefited from stay-at-home gaming fueled by the pandemic.
Shadows also marked Ubisoft’s best ever day-one launch on the PlayStation Store, suggesting particular success on PS5.
But what about PC, given Shadows launched on Steam as well as Ubisoft’s own digital store? According to Ubisoft’s internal communication, 27% of Shadows’ total “activations” were on PC. Ubisoft is telling employees that Steam “played a major role” in Shadows’ performance on PC, without revealing exact sell-through numbers. It says early results “are a strong validation of our decision to return to the platform.”
Generally, Ubisoft is talking up player engagement, which is at “record levels,” and “feedback across moderated, verified platforms — those less affected by review bombing — remains incredibly positive.” Shadows was also the most-wishlisted Ubisoft game of all time, and it’s doing better than any other Assassin’s Creed game on Twitch, even Valhalla.
It’s here that Ubisoft’s internal communication provides context on comparisons between Shadows’ launch and other games in the franchise. What’s clear is that Shadows is not doing as well as Valhalla did at launch, but Ubisoft is saying it’s not fair to compare the two, because Valhalla benefitted from the “perfect storm” of pandemic-fueled stay-at-home gaming and the launch of the Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5 in 2020.
“Valhalla launched under extraordinary conditions — in the middle of a global pandemic, with widespread lockdowns and brand-new console hardware,” the internal communication reads. “It was a perfect storm we may never see again. That’s why it’s more meaningful to compare Shadows to entries like Origins, Odyssey, and Mirage — games released in more typical cycles. And in that frame, Shadows is already setting a new bar as illustrated above.”
Ubisoft also pointed out that Shadows released in March. Historically, Assassin’s Creed games launch just ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving window, which typically boosts sales. Meanwhile, Ubisoft ditched the early access period it normally charges extra for with its games. It’s also worth noting that Ubisoft’s own subscription offering is now available directly on Xbox, which affects sales on Microsoft’s console and muddies sales comparisons.
Money talks, of course, and irrespective of player numbers and engagement, it will be revenue brought in by Assassin’s Creed Shadows that determines the fate of not just the game, but Ubisoft itself. We may not get a clear picture of that until Ubisoft's next financial report in the coming months.

"The first big update forMonster Hunter Wildslooms on the horizon, and next week, Capcom will host a showcase to spotlight what's in store for Title Update 1 in Monster Hunter Wilds.

The Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase airs on March 25 at 7am PT / 10am ET on theMonster Hunter Twitch channel. Hosted by producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, the showcase will spotlight what's arriving alongside returning monster Mizutsune.
Join us March 25 at 7am PT/2pm GMT for the Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase, hosted by producer Ryozo Tsujimoto! We'll be detailing the first Free Title Update coming in early April, which includes Mizutsune and a host of other new additions.Watch here:https://t.co/WbntyFSOZepic.twitter.com/rTuHrT4vAw
Currently, there'sno exact date locked in for Title Update 1outside a general ""early April"" window. A firm launch date for the first big content drop of Monster Hunter Wilds would be one of the big takeaways players would likely want to see in the spotlight.
As for content, we know Mizutsune — a leviathan monster with dangerous bubbles — will return for Monster Hunter Wilds. We also know Capcom plans to add a new challenge as well as a ""new place to meet, communicate, have meals together and more with other hunters,"" specifically for those who have completed the main story.
What's on players' longer wishlist for Title Update 1? Layered weapons, or changing the appearance of your weapon without altering its stats,is a repeated ask. Additional camera options and other quality-of-life features are also sensical options.
There arealso still hopesthat future updates will continue to fine-tune and optimize Monster Hunter Wilds, as the PC versionsaw quite a few complaints and concerns in Wilds' launch window.
Mostly, hunters seem keen on hunting a new monster, getting some new challenges, and having more to dig into with Monster Hunter Wilds. The latest in Capcom's long-running monster-fighting seriesbrought in some big numbers with its launch, and with Title Update 1, the company will be setting the cadence for how it moves forward.
To help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look atwhat Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you, and a guide toall 14 weapon typesin the game. We’ve also got a detailedMH Wilds walkthroughin progress, aMH Wilds multiplayerguide to explain how to play with friends, and if you’ve played one of the open betas, here’show to transfer your MH Wilds Beta characterover.

"Monster Hunter Wildsis laying out its future roadmap. Alongside its planned Title Updates, director Yuya Tokuda has confirmed a few additional goals the team has, as post-launch support for the latest entry in the Monter Hunter franchise carries on.

In aletter from the director, Tokuda started by laying out the roadmapseen in the recent Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase for Title Update 1and beyond. The first big Title Update drops on April 4, this Friday. Then, the seasonal event Festival of Accord: Blossomdance runs from April 23 through May 7. Additionally, April 30 through May 21 will see the Arch-tempered Rey Dau storm into Monster Hunter Wilds.
At the end of May, Update Ver. 1.011 will bring an unannounced Capcom collaboration and some ""other additional features."" Title Update 2 is then planned for this summer, with a new additional monster and seosonal event. Tokuda confirms more free updates are arriving beyond that.
Part of the Mosnter Hunter Wilds' director's letter dug into the question of challenging monster content. Already, fights like Tempered Arkveld, the aforementioned Arch-tempered Rey Dau, and a refight with Zoh Shia are confirmed. Tokuda also confirmed Mizutsune, arriving with Title Update 1, will have an 8-star Tempered Mizutsune fight, available at HR 41 or higher.
The end-of-May update will add even more 8-star Tempered monsters to the Wilds. Tempered versions of Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad will make their way to the game in this update.
""Each of these monsters have had various behind-the-scenes adjustments to make them more resilient, such as increased health, resistance to wounding, and tweaks to multiplayer scaling,"" Tokuda said. ""Challenging monsters will also appear in future updates, so keep an eye out for further information about them.""
Specifically addressing feedback from launch, Tokuda said that Capcom is planning to make ""various adjustments,"" including weapon balance changes.
""These will be implemented gradually with each upcoming title update in order to make the game more enjoyable for everyone for a longer period of time,"" Tokuda said. ""Depending on the content, these changes may take some time to prepare.""
The director noted the Hammer as one weapon being considered for ""upward adjustments,"" which sounds like good news for Hammer mains. Some ""unintentionally overpowered"" things will be adjusted down — the Corrupted Mantle is one example — but Capcom said it plans on adjusting other parts upward, making for a ""generally balanced"" update. The team is currently aiming to implement the overall weapon balance adjustments in either the end-of-May update or in Title Update 2 this summer.
Additionally, Capcom istargeting stability and performance for Monster Hunter Wilds, specifically noting the PC version. Title Update 1 is planned to bring a reduction in VRAM usage and an upgrade to the DirectStorage version of the Steam version, which should result in an ""overall improvement"" of stability for PC players.
More improvements are planned, to bolster the overall technical experience for players on all platforms. Additionally, the in-game economy, balance, and other areas are planned for improvement too.
Quality-of-life is also a major target for the Monster Hunter Wilds team moving forward. The Grand Hub, arriving in Title Update 1, is part of this, condensing various functions into one end-game area. The team has also reduced waiting times for facility functions at each location.
The team is continuing to work on UI/UX improvements and other quality-of-life updates too. A few items on the docket include restocking items, checking skill information, engaging in multiplayer quests, using the Seikret, and camera behavior during hunts.
The rollout stars with Title Update 1 this Friday, April 4, and on into the summer as we approach Title Update 2. Though it's still fresh, Monster Hunter Wilds isalready one of the year's most popular games, and it doesn't look like Capcom is planning to slow down its roadmap for it anytime soon.

"Update 3/14/25 12:02 p.m. ET: Like most limited-edition PS5 hardware releases, the stock situation for this controller appears to be severely, uh, limited. It's currently (possibly!) available atPS Direct. Stock is also holding steady atGameStop, but you can only preorder it if you have a Pro membership (you cansign up herefor $25/year).

It's currently sold out atAmazon,Best Buy,Target, andWalmart, though it's possible any of them could get more stock at some point. I'll keep updating this article as things change.
Here’s one for the post-apocalyptic crowd: Sony is releasing a new limited-edition The Last of Us-themed DualSense controller. ThePS5 controllerfeatures an eye-catching black and white design, with trophy icons from The Last of Us Part I and Part II etched into it. It comes out April 10 with an MSRP of $84.99. Preorders are live now at various retailers (see it on PS Direct). Read on for the details.
The controller was made “in close collaboration” with the Naughty Dog creative team. It features white-on-black icons of the Fireflies’ logo on the touchpad, with the moth and wolf on either side of the grips. A number of other icons also appear in glossy black on matte black. The bottom side of the controller has a The Last of Us logo in white on black. It looks very nice and classy overall, I’d say.
On thePlayStation Blog, Naughty Dog Head of Studio and Head of Creative Neil Druckmann and Graphic Designer Megan Mehran said:
“We were excited by the chance to memorialize The Last of Us franchise in a controller that fans and our own team would love. We wanted to ensure that both installments of The Last of Us are represented, via trophy icons printed in black gloss across the controller body. Among the trophies, three particular images will immediately stand out for TLOU fans: The firefly, moth, and wolf. Players will recognize the Fireflies’ iconic spray-painted logo that originated in Part I, while the moth and wolf represent the intertwining lives and duality between Ellie and Abby in Part II.“
This isn’t the first PS5 game-themed limited-edition controller to hit the market. Others based on games likeAstro Bot,Helldivers 2,Spider-Man 2, andFortnitehave come out, among others, some of which are still available. And those are in addition to all the otherPS5 controllers in various colorsthat are available.
This The Last of Us controller comes out right around a couple of related releases. The Last of Us Part II is coming to PC on April 3, while the second season of theHBO showpremieres on April 13.

"Sony has confirmed The Last of Us Part II Remastered PC specs ahead of its April 3 release date, PSN sign-in incentives, and announced new content coming to No Return Mode across PC and PlayStation 5.

In a post on thePlayStation Blog, developer Naughty Dog listed the features that support studios Nixxes Software and Iron Galaxy helped bring to the PC version of The Last of Us Part II Remastered, which arrives a year after the PlayStation 5 version.
There’s also support for Ultrawide monitors, so you can play in 21:9 ultra-wide, 32:9 super ultra-wide, and even 48:9 resolutions with compatibility for triple-monitor setups.
As you’d expect, you can play in 4K resolution, with various supported controllers as well as keyboard and mouse controls. There’s 3D audio, too.
Keyboard and mouse control support includes new control customization options, including full control remapping, primary and secondary bindings for keyboard and mouse control, and an adaptive mode that allows players to combine keyboard and controller inputs. There’s full gamepad support, while DualSense controllers feature full haptic feedback.
“The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC offers a wide range of graphics settings and presets, to ensure the best possible experience on hardware ranging from high-end PCs to handheld gaming devices,” Sony said.
Moving on to No Return mode, two new characters are being added: The Last of Us Part I’s Bill and Marlene.
Here’s the official blurb from Sony:
Four new maps are coming to No Return, too.
All the new No Return content, plus accompanying new Trophies and additional bug fixes, will be available on PS5 day-and-date with the PC launch via a free downloadable 2.0.0 patch, Sony added.
In keeping withSony’s recent PlayStation Network requirement U-turn, The Last of Us 2 Remastered on PC has an optional PSN log-in. But if you do log in to PSN, you get PlayStation overlay and PSN Trophies. As an extra incentive, Sony said those who sign in with their PSN account also get access to 50 in-game points to activate bonus features, as well as a new skin for Ellie featuring Jordan A. Mun’s jacket from Naughty Dog’s new PS5 game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.
PS5 players will also be able to unlock the Jordan’s jacket skin, Sony clarified. It’s included in the 2.0 patch and unlockable via in-game bonus points.
Earlier this month, The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann shared more details aboutIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. In aninterviewwith Alex Garland, the writer of zombie movie 28 Days Later, Druckmann talked candidly about the development process, confirming Intergalactic has been in the works for four years.
""I joke about this with the team. We made a game,The Last of Us 2, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game,"" Druckmann said, to which Garland joked: ""Who gives a shit?""
""Exactly,"" Druckmann added. ""But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about — let's make a game about faith and religion.""
Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which stars Tati Gabrielle as Jordan A. Mun, takes place in an alternate historical timeline and features a ""pretty prominent religion"" that has ""changed and bastardized and evolved"" over the years, Druckmann said.
The PC version of The Last of Us 2 Remastered arrives ahead of Season 2 of HBO's hit TV adaptation. Showrunners Druckmann and Craig Mazin have confirmed“spores are back” following their omission from Season 1.

"Earlier this year, Dell rebooted the legendaryAlienware Area-51lineup of prebuilt gaming PCs, but until recently you could only configure it with one graphics card option - the RTX 5080. That's no longer the case. Starting now, you can choose to equip your Alienware Area-51 with an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU and - finally - an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 GPU starting at $5,499.99. Better yet, you won't have to wait months for your system to arrive; Dell estimates an early April ship date.

The $5,500 config might be the ""base"" configuration for an Alienware Area-51 gaming PC equipped with a 5090 GPU, but at that price, I would still expect stacked specs, and fortunately, this configuration delivers. It's equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU, 32GB of DDR5-6400MHz RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. TheCore Ultra 9 285Kis Intel's latest flagship CPU and offers stellar workstation and gaming performance. It's not quite the performance uplift we wanted from the i9-14900K, but right now there's nothing better from the Intel camp. The processor is cooled by a massive 360mm all-in-one liquid cooler, and the system is generously powered by a 1,500W 80Plus Platinum-rated power supply.
Dell unveiled the new Alienware Area-51 gaming PC at CES 2025. The chassis looks similar to the 2024 R16 system with aesthetic and cooling redesigns and updated components. The I/O panel is positioned at the top of the case instead of the front, and the tempered glass window now spans the entire side panel instead of just a smaller cutout. As a result, the side panel vents are gone, and instead air intakes are located at the bottom as well as the front of the case. Alienware is now pushing a positive airflow design (more intake than exhaust airflow), which means a less dusty interior. The internal components have been refreshed with a new motherboard, faster RAM, and more powerful power supply to accommodate the new generation of CPUs and GPUs.
The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 has emerged as the most powerful consumer GPU on the market. Although Nvidia has prioritized software updates, AI features, andDLSS 4 technologyto improve gameplay performance, the 5090 still boasts an impressive 25%-30% uplift over the RTX 4090 in terms of pure hardware-based raster performance. The 5090 also has more (32GB vs 24GB) and faster (GDDR7 vs GDDR6) VRAM compared to the 4090. This GPU is extremely difficult to find at retail price andis currently selling for $3,500-$4000 on eBay.
Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 FE Reviewby Jackie Thomas
""The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 has officially taken the performance crown from the RTX 4090, but with less force than previous generations. When it comes to traditional non-AI gaming performance, the RTX 5090 provides one of the smallest generational uplifts in recent memory. However, in games that support it, DLSS 4 really does deliver huge performance gains – you just have to make your peace with the fact that 75% of the frames are generated with AI.""

"Control was IGN’s Game of the Year in 2019 – and I was one of the many editors that voted for it – but even I was skeptical when Remedy, a studio known for telling great single-player stories in third-person games, announced it was doing a Control multiplayer game. That project turned out to be FBC: Firebreak, a three-player PvE first-person multiplayer shooter set six years after the events of Control. And in the hands-off demo I saw, it very quickly became clear that my skepticism was completely unwarranted. Firebreak is refreshingly original in an oversaturated space, delightfully weird amidst a sea of same-y military and/or sci-fi online shooters, and perhaps best of all, it doesn’t require a massive commitment like so many of its contemporaries. As game director Mike Kayatta put it, ""We're not about daily check-ins. We're not interested in monthly grinds. We don't want to give anybody a second job."" Say it again, Mike, for the people in the back.

FBC: Firebreak is a three-player co-op FPS with, if what Remedy is promising comes to pass, no nonsense. You can play for 20 minutes or a few hours if you want to, with Perk unlocks and new combinations amongst characters keeping things fresh for repeat runs. But what the heck are you doing here, back in The Oldest House, with a bevy of bizarre weaponry in your hands? Essentially, you are volunteer first responders in The Oldest House when things go seriously sideways. Your characters are secretaries, rangers, and other “normal” occupations who heed the call of service. The Federal Bureau of Control wouldn’t say you’re expendable, but…you’re expendable.
When you log in to play, you choose a Job (aka a mission) and a Crisis Kit (essentially, your loadout) before setting the Threat Level (difficulty) and Clearance Level, which determines how many zones you'll be playing through in a run. The zones are separated by containment doors, which will take you to the next stage of the Job. And the Job I saw is called Paper Chase, and it’s set in a fairly mundane office section of the FBC building. The Hiss are spreading, and it’s up to you and your two teammates to work together to beat them back.
Of course, you can get the hell out of there as soon as you can if you like, but if you want to get your hands on currencies that let you upgrade and buy new gear, you have to escape safely with them. And the longer you spend exploring for currency, the harder it is to make it back to HQ in one piece.
Speaking of gear, that’s where FBC: Firebreak starts to set itself apart from other multiplayer shooters. Many of the guns are charmingly unusual, and most have a homebrew feel, like the hand-cranked snowball-launching gun that can put out fires (or your friends who are on fire) and soak the sticky-note monster (uh, more on him in a bit). Or the cobbled-together zapper that, when fitted with the right nozzle, can rain down lightning storms on a room full of bad guys. Or the large wrench that, when a squeaky piggy bank toy is attached, causes a swirl of coins to pelt your opponents. Don’t worry, though; there are still staples like a machinegun and shotgun – the latter of which is the go-to for after you’ve either soaked or zapped one of the sticky-note monsters.
Oh yes, about them: the entire point of this particular Job is to eliminate all of the sticky notes before they overrun the entire brutalist building. Note the number of sticky notes left to destroy in the upper left corner. It will actually go way up as the mission progresses because, by the end of it, you face off against…a gigantic sticky-note monster. Think Sandman from the end of Spider-Man 3, but made out of sticky Post-It notes instead of sand.
But it’s not just about weird weapons. There are also fun in-universe gameplay mechanics, too, like the office supply shelf that refills your ammo, the makeshift turret you build after literally dumping it out of a box onto the floor, the stereo speaker that keeps the Hiss at bay, and the rinse station that washes any aggressive sticky notes off of your face. Unlockable Perks also inject more spice and variety into the gameplay. A couple of examples I saw: a Perk where each missed bullet has a chance to return to your clip, and another that lets you extinguish yourself by jumping up and down. Also, if you get two of the same Perk you get a stronger version of it. If you get three, you can share the Perk’s effect with nearby teammates.
By the way, in case you’re wondering, you don’t have to have three people in order to play. You can play solo or in duos as well. Meanwhile, Remedy is aiming for a lower minimum PC spec than usual, but on the opposite end of the spectrum, FBC will also support DLSS4 with multi-frame generation as well as nVidia Reflex and full ray-tracing. It’ll also be Steam Deck verified, and it’s launching into Xbox and PC Game Pass on day one along with PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium. Finally, there is a post-launch content plan that Remedy isn’t ready to share quite yet, and there will be paid cosmetics, but that’s the extent of the microtransactions.
In fairness, I haven’t actually played FBC: Firebreak yet, so I have to be cautious about my enthusiasm. But so far, it certainly passes the eye test. This is almost certainly not a run-of-the-mill multiplayer shooter, in a very good way. And the fact that it’s a get-in and get-out online game that doesn’t require a massive ongoing time commitment in order to enjoy it is a refreshing throwback to the days when that was the norm.

"Amazon has recently dropped the price on the2TB SK Hynix P41 PlatinumPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVME solid state drive (SSD) to only $124.99 shipped. The SK Hynix P41 Platinum is one of thefastest PCI-E 4.0 SSDs available, has DRAM cache, and is considerably less expensive than other comparable SSDs like theSamsung 990 Pro($168) and theWD SN850X($154). This is an excellent SSD for either your PlayStation 5 console or gaming PC.

Update:Price has dropped again from $129.99 to $124.99.
SK Hynix might not be as recognizable of a brand as Samsung or Western Digital among consumers, but make no mistake that they are a major player in the flash memory market. SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and one of the world's largest memory chipmakers and semiconductor companies. They supply components for many reputable brands you've probably heard of, like Corsair and G.Skill.
The Platinum P41 is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read speeds of 7,000MB/s and write speeds of 6,500MB/s as well as random read speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and write speeds of 1.3 million IOPS. The Platinum P41 also has a dedicated DRAM cache, Most SSDs at this price point lack any DRAM cache and instead rely on HMB, or system memory, to cover the shortfall. In terms of reliability and stability, th Platinum P41 has been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written. It uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips, both of which are manufactured in-house. SK Hynix warranties this SSD with a 5 year warranty.
The SK Hynix P41 Platinum makes for a great secondary SSD for your PlayStation 5 console since it performs well above Sony's minimum speed recommendation of 5,600MB/s. It's possible this SSD will run fine without a heatsink, but we like to err on the side of caution and would recommend you install one for peace of mind. Besides, you can get a perfectly adequateslim PS5 heatsink for just $7.
The Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.

"Ubisoft has hailed anotherAssassin’s Creed Shadowsplayer milestone, but has yet to confirm a sales figure for the game.

In asocial media post, Ubisoft said Shadows has seen 2 million players since going on sale on March 20, up from the 1 million on day one.
That’s enough to surpass the launches of both Assassin’s Creed Origins and Odyssey, Ubisoft added. “Thank you for joining the journey in Feudal Japan!”
It’s an impressive start for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but it’s worth bearing in mind that Ubisoft has yet to announce a sales figure for the game. Still, we do know it’s the top-selling game on Steam, where Ubisoft recently returned after years of PC launch exclusivity on the Epic Games Store.
At the time of this article’s publication, Assassin’s Creed Shadows was on 58,894 concurrent players on Steam, enough to break into the top 30 most-played games on Valve’s platform. That peak is expected to rise as we continue into the game’s opening weekend.
For comparison, Origins’ all-time Steam peak was 41,551, over seven years ago, and Odyssey’s was 62,069. It seems likely Shadows will become the most-played Assassin's Creed game on Steam later this weekend.
BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardlaunched on Steam on Thursday, October 31, 2024, and saw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.
The true concurrent peak of Assassin’s Creed Shadows will of course be much higher, given it launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S also. Neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.
There is enormous pressure on Assassin's Creed Shadows to do well for Ubisoft globally after multiple delays and the sales failure of last year’sStar Wars Outlaws. Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number ofhigh-profile flops,layoffs,studio closures, andgame cancellationsin the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release. Things got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family and largest shareholder arereportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investorson a buyout deal that would let them preserve control.
Assassin's Creed Shadows has also endured a number of controversies itself, not least in Japan. This week, IGN confirmed thatUbisoft had quietly released a day-one patch for Assassin’s Creed Shadowsthat made a number of important changes seemingly in response to concern from some Japanese politicians about in-game temples and shrines.
In a remarkable exchange this week, Japanese politician and member of the House of Councillors of Japan, Hiroyuki Kada, raised the issue of Assassin’s Creed Shadows in an official government meeting, andShigeru Ishiba, the Prime Minister of Japan, responded.
On Steam at least, Assassin's Creed Shadows is going down very well with players. It has a 'very positive' user review rating, with 81% of over 6,000 user reviews marked as positive. IGN’sAssassin’s Creed Shadows reviewreturned an 8/10. We said: “By sharpening the edges of its existing systems, Assassin’s Creed Shadows creates one of the best versions of the open-world style it’s been honing for the last decade.”

"The most surprising reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct might have been a third-party game. Announced near the end of the showcase, FromSoftware is developing a brand-new game calledThe Duskbloods, which has some striking similarities to the beloved PlayStation 4-exclusive Bloodborne.

The Duskbloods is a new game, to be clear, set to arrive sometime in 2026 worldwide, and exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2. Playing as the ""Bloodsworn,"" a group that has gone beyond humanity thanks to special blood, players will enter a violent melee to become the ""First Blood.""
Confirmed in a press release from FromSoftware, The Duskbloods is a PvPvE title with ""online multiplayer at its core,"" with up to eight players battling for the win among themselves. So while all the blood, guns, and machinery brings to mind Bloodborne, it may also have quite a bit in common with the upcomingElden Ring Nightreign, though with some PvP rather than solely co-op PvE.
We didn't get much more than that, besides cryptic teases and some looks at some horrifying beasts and bosses. Still, Bloodborne fans are having a wide variety of reactions to this.
""BLOOD! EVERY FIVE SECONDS THEY TALKED ABOUT BLOOD!"" saidone commenter in the r/Bloodborne post about The Duskbloods on Reddit. Another said: ""That game is 100% Bloodborne 2. I assume the name change is either because it's in a different setting, or because of Sony exclusivity.""
Though The Duskbloods is still different, it's easy to see the connections that would have fans feeling like it's a spiritual sucessor to Bloodborne. And while the Souls games and Elden Ring have gone onto other systems — Elden Ring even got aTarnished Edition locked in for the Switch 2— Bloodborne has remained a PlayStation 4 exclusive since release, not even making it over to PC. A port, sequel, or really anything has been something fans have wanted for years.
""Nintendo really got tired of waiting for Bloodborne 2 and just decided to fund it themselves,"" anothercommenter said. Another reply points out that, much like Bloodborne, The Duskbloods is currently a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. ""Bloodborne was always an exclusive, this is on brand,"" areplier added.
The announcement definitely kick-started the Bloodborne faithful, though reality has been setting in with confirmation that this sounds like a battle royale-style game, rather than a single-player RPG you'd normally expect from FromSoftware.
Some commenters startedexpressing dulled excitementover the revelation that The Duskbloods is a PvPvE experience. Threads have sprung up of fans finding this out, only to then express that between a multiplayer focus and Switch 2 exclusivity, they might not be so eager to jump on for The Duskbloods.
We're due to learn more about The Duskbloods soon, as Nintendo will post an interview with director Hidetaka Miyazaki on its website on April 4. Presumably this will shed some light on how exactly The Duskbloods will work, what its PvPvE will look like, and whether this can truly be enough to sate the Bloodborne fans who've been holding out hope for so long.

"Sony and game developer Santa Monica Studio have revealed the Dark Odyssey collection, aGod of War Ragnarökupdate coming to players next week that features in-game equipment themed after one of the franchise's most iconic outfits.

Sony detailed all of the goodies included in its God of War 20th anniversary plans in aPlayStation.Blog post. Dark Odyssey is the real headline here, as it includes a war chest of cosmetic treats for all God of War Ragnarök owners across PlayStation 5 and PC. It’ll arrive as a free update March 20.
Everything included in Dark Odyssey features a clean, black-and-gold look that will no doubt have Kratos and co looking better than ever as they tear their way through Norse mythology. Atreus and Freya both receive their own cosmetic sets as part of the patch, too, as do a variety of the player’s shields and weapons.
The show-stealer, though, is a Dark Odyssey appearance and armor set for Kratos that hearkens back to a skin originally only rewarded to players who managed to beat God of War 2 on God Mode difficulty. Players can claim the content in any Lost Items chest in the base game or immediately in God of War Ragnarök’s roguelike Valhalla mode after the update drops. The patch will also finally introduce the option to customize the appearance of Kratos’ weapons without sacrificing each weapon’s respective ability.
Dark Odyssey Armor & Appearance for Kratos
Dark Odyssey Companion Armor
Dark Odyssey Weapon Appearances & Attachments
Dark Odyssey Shield Appearances & Rönd
God of War Ragnarök released in late 2022, so one simple update was never going to do the series’ 20-year history justice. Also included in Sony’s plans to celebrate God of War is a long list of other activities and offers for those who have stuck with Kratos’ story since the beginning. Highlights include a collection of some snazzy social media assets (that you can downloadhere), an art showcase coming as part ofa collaboration with Los Angeles’ Gallery Nucleus, new merch, sales, multiple vinyl releases covering the franchise’s history, and more. You can pre-order a series of God of War vinyl collections as well as the 20th anniversary retrospective hardcover bookthrough the IGN Storenow.
“On behalf of everyone at Santa Monica Studio, we are immeasurably grateful to have had the chance to build the legacy of this series with and for you, the fans of God of War,” the studio said.
For more on how you can celebrate 20 years of God of War, you can check outan upcoming PlayStation symphony world tour that kicks off next month. You can also read up onwhy we think the next God of War title needs to be just as creative as the ones that came before it.

"Assassin’s Creed Shadowssaw over 1 million players on launch day, Ubisoft has announced.

The game released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on March 20, and just before 4pm in Canada,Ubisoft took to social mediato say it had crossed the 1 million player mark.
“It's not even 4pm here in Canada and Assassin's Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players!” Ubisoft said.
“Thank YOU from the bottom of our hearts for joining this adventure in Feudal Japan. We are beyond excited to start this journey with you!”
While 1 million players on launch day is an impressive achievement, it’s difficult to gauge success when Ubisoft itself hasn’t offered a sales figure or indeed a sales target.
What we do know is that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the top-selling video game globally on Steam right now. Valve’s chart sorts products by revenue, so we can say Ubisoft’s game is currently bringing in more money than any other on the platform.
We also have early days Steam concurrent figures. According to official stats from Valve’s platform, Assassin’s Creed Shadows hit a peak player concurrent figure of 41,412 on Steam on launch day. Assassin’s Creed Shadows released on a Thursday, so it is expected that that figure will grow as we head into the game’s first weekend on sale. We’ll have a better picture of its performance on Steam next week and in the weeks ahead. Neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.
For some context, BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardlaunched on Steam on Thursday, October 31, 2024, and saw a peak of 70,414 players on Valve’s platform.
There is enormous pressure on Assassin's Creed Shadows to do well for Ubisoft globally after multiple delays and the sales failure of last year’sStar Wars Outlaws.

"Is there anything cooler than a samurai who wields a gun? If Dark Horse's newest Rise of the Ronin collectible is any indication, not really. IGN can debut the first images of the Rise of the Ronin: Ryoma Statue, which is being sold exclusively throughthe Dark Horse Direct website.

Check out the slideshow gallery below for a look at this very stylish video game collectible:
Here's Dark Horse's official description of the Ryoma statue:
At 12.75” tall, Ryoma stands ready to strike with his pistol ready. His sheathed blades rest at his side in a sling, a bold reminder to his enemies of his roots in the Hokushin-Itto-ryu school of swordplay. His intricately detailed haori and hakama ripple in the wind, embodying a legacy that shapes his journey. Every detail echoes past traditions, adorning a hero with hope to bridge the past and the future together. His base evokes a timeless Edo street, stone pathways flanked by traditional lanterns with Ryoma forging the pathway of change in a time of transformation.
The Rise of the Ronin: Ryoma Statue is cast in polyresin and sculpted by Bigshot Toyworks, with prototyping and paint by Gentle Giant Ltd. This statue is priced at $249.99 and is limited to 300 pieces worldwide. He can be preordered onthe Dark Horse Direct websitestarting today, with an estimated release window of September-November 2025.
While you're at it, why not check outthe many gaming collectibles available on the IGN Store?
Rise of the Ronin was released on PS5 on March 22, 2024, with a PC release following on March 11, 2025. InIGN's review of Rise of the Ronin, Will Borger wrote, ""Rise of the Ronin marries a cool historical setting, Team Ninja’s mastery of tough-but-fair combat, and some smart RPG design to make a game that is immediately compelling, and even more fun with friends. It’s full of cool little touches, whether it’s throwing something at an enemy with the grappling rope or dropping from your glider onto your horse. Unfortunately, it’s also a game full of map clutter, bloated systems, and a truly absurd amount of junk loot, and the time I spent clearing out everything that didn’t spark joy and dealing with all these non-essential systems made me pine for a leaner, meaner, more focused game. Rise of the Ronin is excellent when it has the courage to be itself and lean into its challenging, rewarding fighting; too often, however, it feels stuck in indecision, torn between what it wants to be and what it feels it’s expected to be, and not even the best samurai can overcome that.""

"Editor’s note: This interview was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior toNintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States due to the potential impact of tariffs. Parts of this interview were edited for clarity.

Nintendo has finally pulled back the curtain onNintendo Switch 2, revealing the company's vision for its next-generation console and its games. Butovershadowing dicussion around what the Switch 2 is capable of, the new gameplay mechanics inMario Kart World, and OG Switch games that will find a new lease of life on Switch 2, isa backlash to Nintendo's pricing strategy.
We sat down with Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience Bill Trinen to talk about the big first-party reveals like Mario Kart World andDonkey Kong Bananza, the strategy behindpricing Switch 2 at $450andMario Kart at $80, the decision to releaseNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour as a paid digital productrather than a pack-in game, his excitement forMetroid Prime 4: Beyond's mouse controlsandMasahiro Sakurai's return to the Kirby franchise, and more. Plus, does Bill know what Switch 2 cartridges taste like? Read our full interview below to find out.
IGN:Congrats on finally unveiling Nintendo Switch 2. How does it feel to finally have it out there?
Bill Trinen:Well, it's just exciting to be able to get all the details out there. For us, the most important thing is that we really want people to recognize and understand that Nintendo Switch 2 is the true successor to Nintendo Switch, takes what you love about Nintendo Switch, and then builds on it with a whole lot of new features and new capabilities and new games that take advantage of those. And really takes what has evolved gaming with Nintendo into something that's a lot more social through things likeGameChat, which takes what was the anytime, anywhere play of Nintendo Switch and makes it more all together, anytime, anywhere.
IGN:So you just mentioned GameChat, that was a huge part of your presentation yesterday. Why was now the time to finally introduce Nintendo voice chat, which is something that people have wanted on your consoles for a really long time?
Trinen:Well, I would say we've always looked at it from the perspective of, 'what is Nintendo's real strength and what are Nintendo's real values?' And for us, the most important thing is putting smiles on people's faces and doing it in a way that people can see and experience the smiles that they have with the people that are most important to them.
And certainly there have been other game systems with chat and things like that up until now, but what we wanted to do was to take something that could finally replicate that same room, couch multiplayer, couch co-op experience and joy, and bring that into an online space. And so for us, GameChat is why it's so important is the combination of being able to see their faces, being able to see what they're doing from a gameplay perspective and being able to feel like you've finally got a virtual space where you can have those same experiences that you might have in your living room. So that's why with the power of, I would say Switch 2, being able to finally execute that has been a big focus for us.
IGN:Cool. And we always knew if you did voice chat, it would be in the most Nintendo way, and just with the camera and the mic on the unit in the dock and you say, 'oh, don't worry the background noise won't get in.' It was a cool presentation.
Trinen:Good. And that's the nice thing is with the built-in microphone, it's like, yeah, you can just voice chat if you want and you can do that portably as well.
IGN:Well, let's talk about Donkey Kong Bananza. I love the title by the way, it's perfect. Although last night when I was scrambling to typemy preview, it autocorrected to 'Bonanza' every time, and I was like, 'I’ve got to add this to my dictionary.' But I love the name and it's so exciting to see DK back in the spotlight after so long. And I noticed so many things just getting my hands on the controller for the first time. So when you guys got this game in at Nintendo of America, what stuck out to you the most? What was your favorite part about working on it from a localization perspective or anything else?
Trinen:Well, so I'll start with a really terrible joke, which is I like to call this the most groundbreaking game in video game history.
IGN:[Laughs] I used that in my preview today. I said, 'you have to break all the ground you can because you might make a groundbreaking discovery.'
Trinen:[Laughs] That's right. So for us, the number one thing that I think is probably just the most satisfying about this game is just DK the character. He's back, he's back in a big way. And DK is a character within the pantheon of Nintendo characters who has always been a bit on the more powerful side, wild at times, silly.
And all of that has just been thoroughly baked into this game. And as the character DK, you're able to use the power of his punches and you might attack an enemy in the environment, and that enemy goes flying and hits a wall and the wall crumbles and you see something there, and that then entices you to go in and start digging through the terrain to see what else you can find back there. And it just creates this incredibly rewarding cycle of destruction and discovery that is woven all throughout the game.
IGN:The discovery via destruction was a really cool cornerstone of this game from my time with it. I thought that was just really great. And the second that I started playing it, I just felt the DNA ofSuper Mario Odysseyand Mr. [Yoshiaki] Koizumi's team all over this in so many ways. Are they the ones that are working on this?
Trinen:It's a very good question. You'll have to stay tuned. We always like to start by showcasing the game and getting people focused on the gameplay, but we'll have some information to share about the developer in due time.
IGN:Okay. Can you tell me, is this internally developed? Because there hasn't been an internal Donkey Kong game since I believe Jungle Beat was the last one?
Trinen:Jungle Beat was the last one.
IGN:You had the NST (Nintendo Software Technology) do the Mario vs. Donkey Kongs, but...
Trinen:NST has done the Mario vs. Donkey Kong games, but this is going to be a fun one.
IGN:So nothing more on that?
Trinen:Nothing more on that yet.
IGN:Okay. I had to try. Let's talk about Mario Kart World, because there's so much great stuff in there, but I thinkthe cow is what's stealing everybody's heart. Did you expect that reaction? There's Akira memes about the cow, it's hilarious out there. Did you know the cow was going to be a big star?
Trinen:I would say perhaps not as big as the cow has become. Internally, certainly the very first moment that we saw the cow, everybody wanted to play as Cow.
IGN:When we were playing Knockout Tour yesterday, there were just like seven cows on the track.
Trinen:Well, that's the other thing that I just love about Mario Kart World is with the interconnected world of tracks, as I'm driving, you'll start something like Knockout Tour and you'll be driving across the continent. And what used to be the Mario Kart model was there's discrete tracks and you race on a discrete track and then you choose a different track and you race on a different discrete track.
And now what I find is I'm driving through, I'm starting in a new track and driving across the terrain and, 'Oh, I just happened to pass through Moo Moo Meadows and now I'm onto the next thing.' And it's just like for somebody that's grown up playing Mario Kart for so many years, just to be able to have that experience and piece it all together mentally into this big massive continent of racing has been a whole lot of fun for me.
IGN:It feels like a theme park of Mario Kart history, and I'm driving yesterday and going through all the different segments and then all of a sudden, 'Oh, I'm in the geyser tunnel from Dino Dino Jungle from Double Dash.' But I'm wondering, so right now it seems like the races, you start at one track and end up at another, and then the final lap is one loop around that final circuit you end up at. Not in the Knockout Tour, that's different, but is there a time trial or versus race mode that’s a way to just do three laps at this track? Or are you always driving interconnected between them when you're racing?
Trinen:You will have abilities to drive three laps on certain tracks. Obviously we've got a Nintendo Direct dedicated to Mario Kart World coming. I think you'll see a lot more on the game there, and I think a lot more that will hopefully surprise you and make you really feel like, 'Wow, there's a lot to this game.'
IGN:That will be really good to see. Because right now it looks great, it plays great, but I think the talk of the town is the price tag. This is an $80 game from Nintendo in the United States and $50 if you buy the Nintendo Switch 2 bundle. But I saw somewhere on your website that that bundle is only available for a limited time while supplies last. Can you just talk about the strategy behind pricing Mario Kart World this way?
Trinen:Well, I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value? Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, but I did read your article this morning and I think you had mentioned that you didn’t find a lot to discover when roaming around. So I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out about that.
But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.
IGN:Okay. And to just stay on pricing for a little bit here.I'm looking at the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of games and some games are $70, some are $80. That's what it's looking like right now. And some are cheaper than that too. I don't think we know the U.S. price for the Welcome Tour yet, but I think we saw the Japanese price is around $10.
Trinen:Yeah, the U.S. price is $9.99 for the Welcome Tour.
IGN:$9.99. Okay, digital only.
Trinen:Yes.
IGN:I'm just wondering about the strategy behind pricing these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions at the combination of the Switch 1 retail price, usually $59.99, and then whatever that upgrade path is, like $10 for Breath of the Wild, making that a $70 game, or Tears of the Kingdom is an $80 game because it's $70 plus the $10 upgrade path. Can you just walk me through the strategy behind not offering any sort of discount for newcomers on Switch 2 and saying, 'Tears of the Kingdom is $80 now just like Mario Kart is?'
Trinen:Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?' What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you're looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that's the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game.
For somebody who has bought Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the Zelda upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership. So there's no additional charge for those. But I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that.
IGN:Okay, thanks. And then the pricing for the console itself, too. A lot of people are talking about it — $450 in the United States, and we know there are definitely global economic factors at play. Can you share anything behind the strategy for pricing of the console? Was this something that was up to the wire where you didn't know what it was going to cost until recently? Can you share any insight?
Trinen:Can't really share insight into any of that. Obviously the cost of everything goes up over time, and I personally would love if the cost of things didn't go up over time. But I think any time you're building a new system that's got new features and new tech, there's costs associated with that. So again, we look at what is the experience on Nintendo Switch? What's the experience on Nintendo Switch 2? What are the new features that it offers? And certainly there's the cost of goods and things that factor into that, but we try to find the right appropriate price for a product based on that.
IGN:Last question on price, I promise. I played Welcome Tour on the show floor and I walked away and thought, 'this is a perfect pack-in game.' It shows what the console is, it shows HDR, it shows these new technologies Nintendo is embracing — in some cases for the first time — and I feel like it's a great showcase for the console. Was there ever any talk of making this a pack-in game, and why did you make the decision to price it as a separate digital product?
Trinen:It's an interesting product. We're actually getting ready today, we're going to be doing someNintendo Treehouse Live segmentsand covering a lot of games in detail. That's one of them. And I think people will be able to see through Treehouse Live probably a little bit more maybe than you were able to see on the show floor. It's a pretty robust piece of software. There's a lot of great detail in there.
For some people, I think there are people who are particularly interested in the tech and the specs of the system and things like that, for them I think it's going to be a great product. It's really for people that want more information about the system rather than necessarily a quick intro to everything it does. And for that reason and just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, 'Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you're getting out of the product.'
IGN:Okay. I want to talk about some of the features of the Joy-Con 2 now because I was really impressed with the mouse functionality. I thought that it worked really, really well in something like Metroid Prime 4. I can see that being the preferred way for a lot of people to play that game. So what are your expectations for mouse controls? Are you hoping that third-party developers make great use of them? Do you think it can bring new types of games? Just talk to me about your feelings about the mouse.
Trinen:Well, personally, I'm really excited about the mouse control. I don't know what your experience with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was, the way that to me is probably my favorite way to play is I like to play split Joy-Con. I just like the freedom of having my hands not locked onto a controller like that. So I often like to play split Joy-Con and having the freedom to just seamlessly drop the mouse down for combat and then pick it back up for split Joy-Con, to me is something, number one, you can't do with any other console, you can't do on PC.
And it makes for a really great experience for the Prime series, particularly because the Prime series is the creator of the first-person adventure genre. And so in a series where you're doing a lot of exploration that's got some combat mixed in with it, that freedom feels right. Because for me, I feel like if I'm doing a lot of exploration, I want to be split Joy-Con. That flexibility to me is amazing.
I think the other thing that probably I'm hoping people are catching onto is that, yes, the Joy-Con 2 introduced mouse control, but they introduce mouse control in conjunction with the other technology within the Joy-Con. So whereas with a PC mouse, you're moving up and down and side to side and whatnot, with the Joy-Con, you've got the added ability to apply things like the angle that you're twisting the Joy-Con at, and having that also impact the play control with the mouse.
Or you've got two Joy-Con that have mouse control each, and that means two things. It means either you can have immediate two-player mouse control gameplay right out of the box with the Nintendo Switch 2, or it means, as we see withDrag x Drive, that you can do things with dual Joy-Con control, which hasn't been done before. And so my hope is really threefold. One, is that our own development teams continue to experiment with what they can do with the mouse to create creative new ways to use it.
I hope that we start to see third-parties that are then looking at opportunities with things like dual mouse control or combination of mouse plus motion control to evolve their gameplay. But I also do hope that when you look at PC developers, for example, if they want to bring a PC-based game to console, they have to spend a lot of time revamping the control scheme and adapting it to button controls. And so having the freedom of mouse control with the Joy-Con hopefully makes PC developers a lot more eager to want to bring their games to Nintendo Switch 2.
IGN:Well, my social team really wants to know. We don't have Switch 2 cartridges here. Do they taste like Switch 1 cartridges?
Trinen:[Laughs] I don't know yet.
IGN:You haven't done a taste test?
Trinen:I have not done a taste test. I keep hoping for pistachio flavor, but that's not happening.
IGN:[Laughs] I don't think that would turn away the kids. Okay, cool. Well, my last question here is that Kirby Air Riders was a huge surprise at the Nintendo Direct yesterday. And to see that is this secret project thatMr. [Masahiro] Sakurai teased earlier this year after wrapping up his YouTube series. Cool to see him come back to work with you guys again. Can you share any details further than that teaser we got in the Direct?
Trinen:Well, I believe Mr. Sakurai has said that there will not be any additional information on the game for quite a while. The team's working very hard on it. But for me, this was probably one of the most exciting announcements for a couple of reasons.
One, I'm always excited to see what Sakurai-san is working on. Two, he created the Kirby character and the Kirby franchise. And so it's great to see him come back to lead and direct a Kirby game again for the first time in a couple of decades. But I think more importantly, I've always felt that Kirby Air Ride on GameCube was a game that was ahead of its time and maybe not fully understood at the time that it came out.
And so I'm just really excited because there's a core group of people that played that game on GameCube that love it to death. And number one, I'm just happy because for them, this is such a big announcement and it's so good to see their excitement. But at the same time, I think that with where we are in the game industry today, I think we've got a real opportunity to introduce a much bigger audience to Kirby Air Riders. And I think people will finally really begin to appreciate just what I think is the genius of Masahiro Sakurai and what he created with that game.
IGN:Well, I'm in that core group. It's like one of my big childhood games. I love Kirby Air Ride, City Trial Free Roam. That's all I was doing, so I'm very excited. But thanks so much, Bill. We're super excited for June 5 and everything else that's coming on the way.
Trinen:Great. Thank you.

In retro news, I'm lighting a 30th birthday cake forIndiana Jones' Greatest Adventures, a SNES treasure that belongs in your museum. Developed by Factor 5 and published by JVC/LucasArts, this SNES gem took the tried-and-trueSuper Star Warsformula and applied it toRaiders of the Lost Ark,The Temple of Doom, andThe Last Crusade. With tight controls, detailed sprite work, and a John Williams-fueled chiptune soundtrack, this was a must-have for 16-bit adventurers.
Back in the day, it was pretty amazing stuff to become Indy as he punched, whipped, and jumped his way through jungles, temples, mines, and deserts—all while avoiding Nazis, cultists, and booby traps. The level variety was impressive, with bonus segments including mine cart chases, boulder dashes, and even some Mode7 dogfighting in a biplane.

"Microsoft has unveiled a list of Xbox Game Pass titles set to join the service in the first half of April 2025, revealing a strong lineup of first- and third-party games, including South of Midnight, Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition, Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls – Ultimate Evil Edition, and more.

It’s a remarkably strong month that was detailed in a recentXbox Wirepost. Expect major hitters to start dropping in tomorrow, April 3, kicking off the month with Gearbox Software’s Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition (Cloud, Console, and PC) for all tiers, while All You Need Is Help (Console), Still Wakes the Deep (Xbox Series X | S), and Wargroove 2 (Console) all join Game Pass Standard. There’s more than enough in this first block to keep even the most dedicated Xbox fan busy all month, but you’ll only have five days before South of Midnight (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) and Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls – Ultimate Evil Edition (Console and PC) arrive for all Game Pass subscribers April 8.
South of Midnight, Compulsion Games’ Deep South-set folklore adventure, is poised to be one of Xbox’s biggest releases of the year, and its presence on Game Pass will no doubt have hordes of players seeing what it has to offer. Microsoft’s official description sheds more light on how it will bring some life to Game Pass this month: “Explore the mythos and confront mysterious creatures of the Deep South in this modern folktale while learning to weave an ancient power to surmount obstacles and face the pain haunting your hometown.”
April 9 follows with Commandos: Origins (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, with Blue Prince (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X | S) coming to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass tiers April 10. Finally, Hunt: Showdown 1896 (PC) will round out the Wave 1 drops come April 15 when it is added for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers.
Xbox Game Pass perks are also getting a refresh for the first half of April 2025. Highlights include the Beyond the Void Bundle for The First Descendant, the Sweet Starter Pack for Candy Crush Solitaire players on mobile devices, and an anniversary Seventh Serving Emote for Sea of Thieves fans. You can see the full list of everything coming to Game Pass in the first half of April below.
Another month of Game Pass newcomers means another batch of games will soon be leaving, too. You’ll be losing access to these titles come April 15, so if you’re interested in playing but don’t think you’ll have time to reach the credits, Microsoft still offers a 20% discount for members looking to pick up a last-minute purchase.

"Just a few months after theAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3Dgraced us with its presence, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D brings its 3D V-Cache technology to a 16-core, 32-threadgaming processorthat’s absolutely overkill for most people, but will have no problem keeping up with powerfulgraphics cardslike theNvidia RTX 5090or whatever comes next.

However, all of those cores come with a high $699 asking price and a 170W power budget, making this processor hard to recommend to anyone who isn’t already building an incredibly powerful (and expensive) gaming PC. For anyone else, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D just makes more sense.
The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D is available March 12, starting at $699. This is a suggested price, and AMD's processors have been known to fluctuate in value depending on demand.
The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D essentially takes the same Zen 5 cores behind the regular9950Xand pairs them with the new 2nd-generation 3D V-Cache found in the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. That means you still get excellent multi-core performance, but paired with better gaming performance thanks to a more capacious cache.
Unlike the Ryzen 9 7950X3D that preceded it, though, the 3D V-Cache is now physically located below the actual CPU cores, rather than above them. This seems like a minor change, to be sure, but it ends up making a major difference in thermal performance. Because the CCD, or Core Complex Die, is what produces most of the CPU’s heat, having it closer to the Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS), means it’s able to dissipate heat more easily. And with AMD’s performance algorithm taking thermal headroom into account, those lower temperatures mean the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is able to run faster, longer.
The physical location of the cache is about more than just temperatures, though. Because it’s directly under the CPU cores, there is less distance for the data to travel, which cuts down on latency. Plus, because the cache gets more space, AMD was able to shove in a ton of it, with the 9950X3D having 144MB of combined L2 and L3 cache. That’s the same amount as in the last-generation Ryzen 9 7950X3D, but it’s still much more than you’re going to find in any non-X3D processor.
Both the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and 9950X3D have the same 170W TDP, though the original 9950X has a higher potential PPT. Though, in my testing, I found that both processors ended up peaking at 200W. Though, the 9950X3D did have a lower peak temperature, only reaching 79°C during the test suite – though it was tested on a different cooler than the original 9950X.
Luckily, because the 9950X3D isn’t using a new chipset, it's compatible with any AM5 AMD motherboard. AMD has come out and said it would support this socket until at least 2027, so you won’t have to worry about getting locked into a dead platform.
Before I dive into performance results, I have to note that all CPUs were tested on the same hardware, with one exception: the Ryzen 9 9950X. That was tested on an Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero motherboard with a Corsair H170i 360mm AIO cooler. This difference in hardware will have an impact on performance, but it’s not likely to be a major difference, especially since everything is tested at stock settings.
This happened largely because one of the mounting screws for the Asus ROG Ryujin III 360mm cooler I was using snapped when swapping to the 9950X. I will retest the processors in the coming weeks, and if anything is significantly different I’ll be sure to update this section.
The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D is a 16-core, 32-thread gaming processor with an absolutely ridiculous 144MB of cache, so it shouldn’t be too surprising that it’s incredibly powerful. Even in creative benchmarks, where the 9800X3D fell behind, the 9950X3D has no problem keeping up with the most powerful chips on the market.
What’s surprising is how well the 9950X3D holds up against 9800X3D in single-core workloads. For example, in Cinebench 1T, the 9950X3D gets 2,254 points, compared to 2,033 points, making for a 10% improvement. Then, in the 3DMark CPU Profile test, the 9950X3D scores 1,280 points, which comes in striking distance to the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K’s 1,351 points.
Of course, in multi-threaded workloads, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is really able to stretch its legs, scoring 40,747 points in Cinebench’s multi-core test. Just like the 9800X3D, the 9950X3D does lose some top-end performance in multi-threaded applications, falling short of the 41,123 points from the 9950X and 42,245 points from the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, but it's worth it for the boost in gaming performance.
In Total War: Warhammer 3 at 1080p with Ultra settings, the 9950X3D is able to get 274 fps when paired with the RTX 4090. Compared to 254 fps from the 9800X3D and 255 from the Core Ultra 9 285K, the 9950X3D easily takes the crown here. However, in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with the Ultra preset and ray tracing disabled, the 9950X3D delivers 229 fps, down from 240 fps from the 9800X3D. That’s a disappointing result, but it’s still way faster than the 165 fps from the competing Intel processor.
The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D might be the most powerful gaming processor on the market right now, but that doesn’t mean it has a de facto lead on every other chip on the market. Most people will have no problem getting by with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which just so happens to be much much more affordable at $479.
Instead, the 9950X3D is geared towards gamers that both play games and use creative apps like Photoshop and Premiere, the latter of which sees a 15% performance improvement over the 9800X3D. For a pure gaming PC build, though, you’re probably better off saving that extra $220 for a better graphics card.

The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D is an incredibly powerful gaming processor. It takes the 3D V-Cache that made the 9800X3D so good and shoves it in a processor with twice as many cores. This doesn’t do too much to boost gaming performance, but it makes the 9950X3D a much more flexible processor for anyone that likes to both work and play on their PC."
"Star Wars Hunterspublisher Zynga has announced plans for the game to shut down entirely just nine months after it was released, and it appears plans to launch a PC version of Steam are scrapped.

The NaturalMotion-developed, free-to-download team-based battle arena game launched on Nintendo Switch and iOS and Android in June 2024. IGN’sStar Wars: Hunters reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Star Wars: Hunters’ lighthearted PvP fun is like a party at the Death Star: Impressive for a bit, but probably not a place you’ll want to hang around for too long.”
It seems the review was prescient, asZynga announcedthat “after careful consideration” it had decided the final content update for Star Wars: Hunters across all platforms would be released on April 15, with the game remaining playable until October 1, 2025.
“We understand this news may be disappointing and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly,” Zynga continued. “Your passion and dedication to the game and its community have meant the world to us, and we are committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process.”
Here are the logistics: on March 25, Season 5 will be extended by three weeks. Zynga will re-run events and shop bundles from the Season, and the Ranked Season will also be extended, giving players more time to hit Kyber 1 rank.
On April 15, the game’s final content update will be released for free and in-game purchases will be disabled across all platforms. New Support Hunter, Tuya, will join the game as part of the final update. Tuya will be available and playable for all users immediately at no cost, along with a slate of additional in-game content. Zynga will continue to run a final Ranked Mode leaderboard for players to compete in and run all battlefields and game modes in rotation.
And then, on October 1, online servers will officially shut down, and Star Wars: Hunters will no longer be playable beyond this point.
There’s no mention of the PC version,which was announced to launch on Steam in early access form this year, in the shutdown notice. Its Steam page now includes a notice that the game is “no longer available on the Steam store.”
Take-Two-owned Zynga is best known for mobile games FarmVille, Words with Friends, and CSR Racing, but with Star Wars: Hunters it branched out to console for the first time. Similarly, Star Wars: Hunters was meant to be the first Zynga-published game to launch on PC.
“The success of Star Wars: Hunters on mobile and Nintendo Switch devices has led to our decision to expand the game to PC,” said Yaron Leyvan, executive vice president, games, at Zynga, back in November.
“This is something our community of fans have been asking for and we are very excited to welcome even more players to Vespaara. This moment also marks a milestone for Zynga as we bring one of our games to PC for the first time.”
There are still a number of Star Wars video games in the works, including Respawn Entertainment's third Star Wars Jedi game andBit Reactor's turn-based tactics game set to be revealed at Star Wars Celebration 2025.

"The GeForce RTX 4090 is a generation older than the new Blackwell 50 series GPUs, but this doesn't change the fact that it's still one of the most powerful cards out there, eclipsing the GeForceRTX 5080orRTX 4080 Superor the RadeonRX 9070 XTorRX 7900 XTX. Only one GPU performs better - theRTX 5090- and you'll need to use up a lifetime of luck to find one that isn't marked up by hundreds, even thousands of dollars.

Because the RTX 4090 has been discontinued, it's getting harder to source as well. Fortunately, Dell still sells aAlienware Aurora R16gaming PC configuration that can be equipped with a 4090 GPU. Not only is it one of the few RTX 4090 prebuilts still available - Lenovo and HP no longer carry them - it's also one of the more reasonably priced ones.
ThisAlienware Aurora R16 gaming PCis equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F CPU, GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, 16GB of DDR5-5200MHz RAM, and a 1TB NVMe SSD. The processor can also be upgraded up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K. If you're getting system with a focus on gaming, then the upgrade is unnecessary. Gaming at higher resolutions is almost always GPU bound, and besides, the default Intel Core Ultra 7 265F is a solid processor with a max turbo frequency of 5.3GHz and a total of 20 cores. It's cooled by a robust 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler and the entire system is powered by an 1,000W 80PLUS Platinum power supply.
Dell just dropped the price on this upgraded RTX 4090 model to $3,599.99 after a $400 instant discount. It's $600 more than the base model Alienware 4090 gaming PC, but that's because the processor has been upgraded to a much more powerful Intel Core i9-14900KF CPU. You also get quadruple the RAM and double the storage.
The RTX 4090 is themost powerful RTX 40 series GPUon the market. Compared to the new Blackwell cards, only the $2,000 MSRP RTX 5090 is superior in performance. This card will run every game comfortably at 4K resolution; you should be hitting 60+fps even with all settings turned to the max and ray tracing enabled, doubly so if DLSS is supported. The only setting that the 4090 (as well as every other GPU) struggles with is path tracing, but no one really ever turns this on except during benchmark tests or social media flexing. The RTX 5090 might be faster, but for the vast majority of people out there, it's just wasted power since the 4090 already excels at pretty much all things gaming.
Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU Reviewby Chris Coke
""The RTX 4090 may be huge and expensive, but holy smokes if it doesn’t blow the competition out of the water. That’s a little unfair because it’s currently the only card of this new generation that’s available, so we only have cards from the past few years to compare it to. But until the rest of the pack can catch up, between its impressive hardware specs and its DLSS 3 AI wizardry, even the $1,599 price doesn’t seem unreasonable for the unrivaled frame rates that this card can crank out.""
Dell is offering anAlienware Aurora R16 gaming PCequipped with the new GeForce RTX 5080 GPU for $2,499.99 shipped. The RTX 5080 is one of three new Blackwell graphics cards that are out (and impossible to find). In ourNvidia GeForce RTX 5080 FE review, Jackie writes that ""If you already have a high-end graphics card from the last couple of years, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 doesn’t make a lot of sense – it just doesn’t have much of a performance lead over the RTX 4080, though the extra frames from DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation do make things look better in games that support it. However, for gamers with an older graphics card who want a significant performance boost, the RTX 5080 absolutely provides – doubly so if you’re comfortable with Nvidia’s AI goodies.""

"Logitech is entering a new generation of its Pro series product line of PC peripherals, which focuses on high-performance gaming. With the Pro X TKL Rapid, we have a tenkeyless keyboard chock-full of fresh features centered around a magnetic switch technology that’s new for Logitech, wedging itself among some of thebest gaming keyboardsavailable today. This comes with intricately adjustable functionality and robust RGB customization Logitech users have become accustomed to. After putting it through its paces, the Pro X TKL Rapid proves to be an impressive piece of gear that abandons most flashy aesthetics in favor of letting the keys be the star of the show.

At first glance, the TKL Rapid looks like any other Logitech G series keyboard. It’s a simple black rectangle with thin bezels with RGB lights shining through each key. Hovering atop the standard layout are a series of media keys and a large volume control wheel on the top right, which is quite nice to use. Because of its tenkeyless design, the TKL Rapid has a mercifully small footprint – for a keyboard focused on performance, I appreciate how much it doesn’t get in the way of whatever else is happening on my desk.
Its visible parts don’t stand out on the black colorway, which is the model I’ve been testing. For those who want a little more visual pizazz, it comes in white or pink variants as well. The keys are made of recycled ABS plastic, as is the frame, with a solid aluminum slab supporting the keyboard’s frame. There are certainly better quality and more stylish keycaps out there, but what comes stock is comfortable enough, if not completely unremarkable in feel – at least it doesn’t stand out for any bad reasons. The keys are stable on the switches, with no wiggle that I’ve noticed on the keycaps. Of course, these are parts keyboard enthusiasts can swap out, and the TKL Rapid is compatible with third-party keycaps if you want to make it more unique.
The TKL Rapid’s special sauce is under the caps in the debuting magnetic analog switches and it’s further enhanced by the level of customization within Logitech’s robust G Hub app. The move from mechanical to analog switches to make gaming better isn’t just a marketing move; it really can make a difference (as is the case in themany Hall Effect gaming keyboards we’ve reviewedrecently). Instead of having a set actuation point built into a mechanism, analog switches can be adjusted via software and set the actuation point of each key, letting it recognize inputs at varying travel distances without having to swap out the switch. Even better, it can be changed on each individual key, allowing for incredible personalization.
Straight out of the box, my first hours using the keyboard were troubling, but once I dialed in the right settings, the experience came together nicely. On default settings, I was initially consistently mistyping, chalking it up to getting used to the device. After a lengthy session of using the keyboard, it simply didn’t feel quite right. That’s until I installed G Hub and started messing around with the actuation point of my keys. By default, the Pro X TKL Rapid is set to a 2.0mm actuation, which was a little too shallow for my typing style, especially considering the keyboard’s superlight 35g actuation force. Luckily, this can be shifted anywhere between the extremely light touch of 0.1mm to almost the complete depth of the key press at 4.0mm. Once I dialed in around 3.0mm, it was a revelation, and I started enjoying the keyboard a whole lot more.
It’s notable that while we are dealing with magnetic technology, adjusting the actuation point doesn’t change the pressure needed to press a key, which doesn’t take much, considering the TKL Rapid is made with competitive gaming in mind. Rather, it reads magnetic fields within the switch as the key travels and triggers at whatever distance is set for that key in G Hub. Logitech isn’t a pioneer with these switches, andHall Effect is gradually becoming the standardin high-end keyboards, but they’re utilized very well in this model and helped open my mind on what’s possible with a gaming keyboard.
Complementing the adjustable actuation points is Rapid Trigger, a feature that affects how far upward the key needs to ascend before it is considered to be released. If you use it,  the key doesn’t have to return to its default position to reset, which has had promising results while playing games. Testing the feature with Diablo IV, I was undoubtedly unleashing my abilities faster, setting the Rapid Trigger to reset at 0.5mm, with a range of 0.1mm to 2.0mm to play with. It certainly makes a difference in fast-paced games where a critically-timed button press is of the utmost importance.
Check out our roundup of thebest gaming mice!
Not only can you globally set the actuation points and Rapid Trigger for the entire keyboard, but each key can be adjusted individually for both features and save profiles to be loaded for specific games when they launch. Your Overwatch 2 setting preferences are bound to be different from League of Legends or Path of Exile, and I absolutely love how I can fine-tune the TKL Rapid for each game in mind.
Because there are a lot of complications with every key potentially having different activation and release points, the TKL Rapid includes a Key Priority setting. With this tool, I was able to pair two keys that may be pressed around the same time, like my Mage’s spells on the number row in World of Warcraft, and determine which one is more important to be the one that is accepted at that moment. There are varying options like Key Travel Priority, which chooses the key that’s pressed furthest, or Absolute Priority, which will, well, choose which one key will absolutely work instead of the other. As someone who sometimes fumbles my spells in tense situations, it certainly helped clean up my casting rotation during dungeons and eliminate mistakes.
But really, this is Logitech's version of SOCD input, or simultaneous opposite cardinal direction, which is a contentious feature in competitive gaming. In a shooter, this lets you counter-strafe (or jiggle strafe) without interuption which would be impossible otherwise, making you a much harder target. You can, and will, get kicked from Counter-Strike 2 matches, for example. (We found out the hard way when reviewing theRazer BlackWidow V4 Pro 75.) If you use this feature, just be mindful of the context in which you use it in.
While it’s not the typical use case for a keyboard like this, during my time with the Pro X TKL Rapid, I took it with me on a road trip, and it traveled surprisingly well. Due to its tenkeyless design, its narrower frame fits wonderfully in my backpack. Paired with its removable USB-C cable that’s slim enough to slip into an available pocket, I didn’t have to worry about sacrificing critical space next to or around the keyboard. The keys are still full-sized, so there’s still a consideration of how far they protrude, but I’m happy to report it’s not at all farfetched to take the TKL Rapid on the go.
Of course, being a premium product, Logitech’s usual suite of features applies to the TKL Rapid. It features full RGB lighting on every key, which can be adjusted per key in G Hub. It hits just about every color in the rainbow except a clean white and some shades of purple, which both end up more blue than anything, which is slightly disappointing.
Game Mode is also available, with a physical button above the first section of F keys, which disables buttons like the Windows and menu keys, which can interrupt heated matches if pressed by mistake. In addition, it provides the option to choose which other keys you’d like to wipe the functionality off, leaving only your critical keys active while Game Mode is engaged. Along with key mapping and more layout profiles to flip through with G-Shift, the TKL Pro is endlessly customizable for whatever game you want to adapt to.
The Logitech G Pro X TKL Rapid is available for $169.99 from retailers such asAmazonordirectly from the Logitech. While we received the black color scheme for review, it also comes inbright magentaandall-white colorway.
The more you tweak the Logitech G Pro X TKL Rapid, the more you’ll get from this remarkable keyboard. Its level of customization is staggering, and there’s a lot of nuance in tweaking it for each game I’m playing, but it also makes it feel stellar as my everyday typing tool. While the cost of entry is steep for a rather basic-looking keyboard – even if it’s relatively close to its competitors at a retail price of $170 – the TKL Rapid is worth it for all the bells and whistles made possible by the switch to magnetic analog switches. It’s a new standard for dedicated PC gamers, but it also succeeds for those looking for an exceptional and reliable compact keyboard."
"Amazon has the best deal right now on an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT prebuilt. You can pick up theSkytech Blaze4 RX 9070 XT gaming PCfor only $1,599.99 after a new $100 instant discount. That's a great price for a newly released GPU that stands toe to toe with an RTX 5070 Ti (or RTX 4080), which could easily run you well over $2,000 in this absurd market.

This Skytech gaming PC is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 7700 processor, Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU, 16GB of DDR5  RAM, and 1TB M.2 SSD. This is a pretty nicely thought out configuration, with a competent AMD processor and DDR5 RAM with an optimal DDR5-6000MHz speed rating. The AMD Ryzen 7 7700 features a max boost clock speed of 5.3GHz with 8 cores, 16 threads, and a 32MB L2 cache. You won't see much of a gaming performance uplift if you were to go for a newer Ryzen 7 or even a Ryzen 9 processor, especially at higher resolutions. Going by the photos, a 360mm aio liquid cooling system keeps CPU temps down. The entire system is powered by a generous 850W 80PLUS Gold power supply.
We rated the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT a ""perfect"" 10/10. Even though it costs $150 less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the 9070 XT beats it out in several of the games we tested. In a few benchmarks, the results aren't even close. The 9070 XT also has 16GB of VRAM, the same as the 9070 and 5070 Ti.
AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas
""PC Gaming has been in a decadent spiral since 2020, and the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is a reminder that it doesn’t have to be that way. This graphics card has no problem maxing out any game you throw at it at 4K, even with ray tracing enabled, and does so at a price that makes the competition look downright greedy. I can’t predict the future, so only time will tell if the launch price holds up. What I do know is we need more graphics cards like the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT.""

"Developer Goodwin Games has announced a new survival horror game for PC called Quite a Ride. Built with Unreal Engine 5, you must keep pedaling on your bike in order to keep the fog around you – and the horrors within it – from consuming you. It doesn't have a release date as of yet.

As Goodwin describes it, ""You travel by bicycle through a foggy rural landscape filled with eerie secrets and monsters lurking in the dense mist. The game's atmosphere and themes draw inspiration from Stephen King's works and iconic horror films of the '80s and '90s."" Check out the announcement trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.
Your phone's battery drains over time and must be recharged by continuing to pedal your bike. And that phone will keep sending you strange messages that might help or hurt you. Meanwhile, as you go, you'll encounter oddities like deserted towns and bizarre laboratories. The road is always changing, but Goodwin says there's a unique pseudo-multiplayer twist: ""Players' collective global efforts can change the environment, unlocking new locations, hidden characters and secret quests over time.""

"The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card was released in late February for $749.99, but good luck finding one at that price. As with the rest of the Blackwell lineup, everyone from personal sellers to themanufacturers themselveshave joined in on theprice markup bonanza. Fortunately there's a way to get around these shenanigans, and that is by purchasing a prebuilt gaming PC instead.

Of all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and already marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled.

Across my entire test suite, this GPU soared at 4K, coming within striking distance of much more expensive graphics cards, and that’s before taking multi frame generation into account, which will make the RTX 5070 Ti even better at hitting extremely high framerates, albeit with a hit to latency.""

"Microsoft has created a playable ""interactive space inspired"" byQuake IIusing AI, and it's sparked a vociferous debate online.

As spotted byPC Gamer, thedemois powered by Microsoft'srecently announced Muse and the World and Human Action Model (WHAM) AI system, and ""can dynamically create gameplay visuals and simulate player behavior in real-time,"" which means a semi-playable environment has been generated entirely through AI and without an in-game engine.
""In this real-time tech demo, Copilot dynamically generates gameplay sequences inspired by the classic game Quake II,"" Microsoftexplained. ""Every input you make triggers the next AI-generated moment in the game, almost as if you were playing the original Quake II running on a traditional game engine. Enjoy the experience, share your thoughts, and help shape the future of AI-powered gameplay experiences.
""This bite-sized demo pulls you into an interactive space inspired by Quake II, where AI crafts immersive visuals and responsive action on the fly. It’s a groundbreaking glimpse at a brand new way of interacting with games, turning cutting-edge research into a quick and compelling playable demo.""
All thatsoundspretty impressive, but the demo itself is... well, less so.
After The Game Awards boss Geoff Keighley shared a brief video of the demo in actionon X / Twitter,hundreds of people responded, with few having anything positive to say.
Microsoft has created an AI-generated replica of Quake II that you can play in browser.""Every frame is created on the fly by an AI world model.""Play it here:https://t.co/WGQymDOmsjpic.twitter.com/35MX5aHPbF
""Man, I don't want the future of games to be AI-generated slop,"" said oneRedditor. ""There will be a point where it will be easier to use AI, and then all the greedy studios will do it exclusively. The human element will be removed.
""And the worst part is gamers will buy it. They buy skins for 100 dollars. They will buy whatever you sell them.""
""Microsoft's boast that they want 'to build a whole catalog of games that use this new AI model,' despite it not being clear if the current technique will ever even be capable of letting you turn around without moving to a random point on the map let alone come up with an original game, really typifies what's wrong with AI and the tech industry,""addedanother.
""I had a better experience literally just imagining the game in my head,""saidanother commenter.
Not everyone was so quick to dismiss it, however.
""I don't know why everything has to be doom and gloom,""saida more cheery respondent. ""It's a demo for a reason. It shows the future possibilities. Having an AI that is able to create a coherent and consistent world is crazy. But this cannot be used to create a full game or anything enjoyable. You cannot play this. Seems like a tool for early concept/pitching phase. This can also bring improvement in other fields in AI as what it is doing is impressive.

Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI.The game failed, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”
Still, that hasn’t put off a number of video game companies from using generative AI in the development of their products.Activision recently disclosed the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assetsas part of new requirements on Steam, amid a backlash to an ""AI slop"" zombie Santa loading screen.
And last month,Horizon actor Ashly Burch addressed a controversial AI Aloy video that leaked online, using it to call attention to the demands of striking voice actors.

"Bloodborneturns 10 years old today, and fans are celebrating by organizing yet another return to Yharnam community event.

FromSoftware’s PlayStation 4 masterpiece launched on March 24, 2015, and helped cement the Japanese developer as one of the greatest of our time. Critical and commercial acclaim followed, and a follow-up in the vein of the Dark Souls sequels seemed inevitable.
But since then… nothing. Why hasn’t Sony followed upBloodbornewith either a current-gen remaster, a full-on sequel, or at the very least a next-gen update that would finally make it officially playable in 60fps? Fans have begged Sony for more Bloodborne ever since it came out. The deafening silence in response remains one of the most puzzling business decisions in all video games.
Earlier this year, we got an explanation of sorts. Following his exit from Sony,PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida revealed his Bloodborne no-show theory. To be clear up front: this is Yoshida’s opinion, which inan interview with Kinda Funny Gameshe stressed was not inside information, or the reveal of the current deliberations within the bowels of Sony itself.
“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida said. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.
“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”
Miyazaki-san is of course Hidetaka Miyazaki, the boss of FromSoftware. And yes, he’s incredibly successful. Not only for the influential Dark Souls series, but, most recently, the mainstream hitElden Ring, which propelled FromSoftware to new heights. So much so thatit’s getting a multiplayer spin-off this year.
And it seems obvious to say Miyazaki will be incredibly busy with multiple projects to direct and a company to run. After Bloodborne came out in 2015, Miyazaki directedDark Souls 3, then 2019’sSekiro: Shadows Die Twicefor Activision, then the aforementioned Elden Ring for Bandai Namco. What's next? Miyazaki has yet to say.
In interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year,Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware.
In the years since, modders have tried to fill the gaps with fan-made projects that improve upon the base PS4 Bloodborne experience. But Sony has taken a dim view.Well-known Bloodborne 60fps mod creator Lance McDonald announced in Januarythat he’d received a takedown notification on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment “asking that I remove links to the patch I posted on the internet, so I've now done so.” The DMCA takedown arrived four years after the mod was released.
Then, just a week later, Lilith Walther,creator ofNightmare Kart, which was previously known asBloodborne Kart, and the eye-catching Bloodborne PSX demake, tweeted to say an old YouTube video of the demake was hit with a copyright claim.
Recently, fans managed to get PS4 emulators to deliver something akin to a remaster on PC. The tech experts atDigital Foundry released a videocovering “a breakthrough in PS4 emulation” via ShadPS4, which means Bloodborne is now fully playable start to finish in 60fps. Could this breakthrough have triggered an aggressive response from Sony? IGN asked Sony for comment at the time, but it has yet to respond.
That’s all we have to go on, really, which leaves Bloodborne fans to take it upon themselves to organize Return to Yharnam community events.Another kicks off today, on Bloodborne’s 10th anniversary, and calls on fans to create a new character, and summon as many random cooperators and invaders as possible, and leave in-game messages flagging they’re a part of this latest community drive.
Perhaps this will be all that’s left for fans to do in the world of Bloodborne forever more.

"In 2012, Assassin’s Creed 3 director Alex Hutchinson called out people on the internet for suggesting the most “boring” future settings for the series. “The three most wanted [settings for Assassin’s Creed] are WWII, feudal Japan and Egypt,” he explained at the time, adding “They’re kind of the three worst settings for an AC game.” Hutchinson later clarified his statement, saying “the point I was trying to make was that in the broad strokes and scale of history, that’s a theme that’s been well-mined in video games.” He’s not wrong and since he made his most recent comments, Ghost of Tsushima, Rise of the Ronin, Nioh and more have all shone a spotlight on feudal Japan.

Fast-forward to 2025 and Assassin’s Creed is finally going to one of these “worst” settings with Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, but Shadows director Jonathan Dumont believes his team has found a new way to tell the story of feudal Japan.
""I think it's not boring at all. The setting is very exciting,"" Dumont says when asked about Hutchinson’s quote. ""I do think that being able to bring it to life and have that balance of the political intrigue [of the era], the war and conflict, and also the beauty of nature and supporting more exploration within this changing world give it another dimension [compared to other games].""
Hutchinson wasn’t wrong back in 2012. The setting of Feudal Japan has indeed been one of the most requested locations for the Assassin's Creed series. Bringing the series' unique blend of historical fiction and sci-fi to the backdrop of warring states and samurai in fierce conflict seemed like a no-brainer for developer Ubisoft to make happen sooner rather than later. The only problem was Ubisoft chose later, perhaps to its detriment.
Though Ubisoft has been praised for exploring previously overlooked historical settings like Egypt and Industrial Revolution England, other developers have beaten Ubisoft to open-world stealth-action games set in Japan with titles like Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Tsushima. That said, shows like FX’s Shogun prove that people’s appetites for samurai action hasn’t waned in the least. Much like Shogun, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows explores how outsiders navigate the courts and politics of feudal Japan. And the Assassin’s Creed name has a built-in reputation all on its own.
Dumont highlights the conflict and historical impact of the era – particularly in how Japan was ""opened up"" to the rest of the world for the first time following the arrival of Portuguese merchants and missionaries during the late 1500s Sengoku era.
""What made the setting interesting for us to tackle was the political landscape of the time, along with the arts and the environment of that era. We've seen other games do it before, but not in the Assassin's Creed way that we're doing it,"" says Dumont. ""We also have that big open-world feeling with the big cities, the wilderness, and we really touch upon the historical arts and the reconstruction of these locations to make it real for that time. So I don't think we've seen that necessarily in a lot of games [covering this era] – to truly explore and bring you into that world.”
According to Dumont, the political intrigue of the era made it a particularly compelling setting to tackle for Assassin's Creed. A key difference he highlights that makes Shadows different from other games is how it brings a more dynamic and deeper dive into a politically troubled era filled with conflict – one that players will be able to immerse themselves in and learn more about almost from the moment the game begins.
There is also the matter of new technology that Ubisoft utilized in order to bring its version of Japan to life.
""The team was very enthusiastic about Assassin's Creed's take on Feudal Japan, and we felt that the latest technological improvements and new consoles would help us bring that vision to life,"" says Dumont. He highlights the dynamic weather and seamless open-world, and according to our review, the team seemingly succeeded in creating one of the best historical locations in Assassin’s Creed history.
Remember, the Assassin’s Creed series began during the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 era, and since then technology has come a long way, with 4K resolution, bigger open worlds with greater density, and ray-tracing now standard on consoles and PC.
""What that does is give a much more 'alive' feeling than what we've done in the past [with other games],"" he continues. ""So I think that technology that took a few years to develop is omnipresent and all around you within the game. It does bring another dimension of being able to see the world in different states – which gives it more depth. It would not have been possible to make Shadows without our current technology; I don't think we would have gotten that feeling of losing ourselves in this open world without it.""
What makes the Assassin's Creed series so compelling is how it takes historical settings and injects its patented stealth-action gameplay and open-world immersion to make them all the more engrossing. Assassin's Creed Shadows leans into the samurai and ninja fantasy, much like other games tackling this setting. And the need to one-up the competition presented a big challenge to ensure the game's scope was well realized – and given the lengthy wait for the series to tackle a Japan setting, Dumont felt the wait was worth it.
“It's really all about keeping the vision there, and the team keeps pushing for better quality in every aspect,” he says. “There's always a challenge with trying to meet people's expectations, and we also put the pressure on ourselves to do the best we can.""

"Moza’s R3 PC Wheel and Pedals bundle is a competitively priced and compelling pit stop for any newcomer looking to dip a leaden foot into simming. Also, it’s an ideal, ready-to-race package that will rev the engines of anybody who dreams less of shaving PBs on a track and more about shredding POS cars in Wreckfest 2.

Better than that, though, it’s just big gobs of fun with physics a-go-go and punchy force feedback aplenty.
While the 3.9Nm thrumming in this wheelbase doesn’t exactly redline with its peak power, it’s still a solid and stylish DD unit that hums along like a finely tuned machine. Unlike its clunkier, noisier gear-and-belt-driven rivals at the entry level, the R3 is whisper-quiet and ridiculously compact in comparison. Better yet, the bundle is extremely mod-friendly, so upgrading your ride down the road is a cinch—no need to swap out the whole chassis.
The Moza R3 Racing Wheel and Pedals bundle is a full-throttle, plug-and-play racing system. Inside the box, you’ll find Moza’s new 3.9 Nm R3 wheelbase, a 280mm PC-compatible steering wheel, a set of SR-P Lite pedals, and a separate table clamp is also included. Believe you me, you’re going to need that last bit of kit once the FFB gets going. Nothing jerry-rigged or half-arsed is going to hold this sucker down when the cars start cartwheeling.
Said clamp is made entirely of steel and is rigid as hell—quite sturdier than the plastic alternatives, and it has a generous 50mm of clamp space. Via the chaos of Wreckfest 2, I certainly gave that rigidity a run for its money. Thanks to a beefy desk and a straightforward system of four mount holes to secure the R3 wheelbase, this setup holds up well under the stresses of force feedback.
Weighing in at just 2.29 kilos and measuring a compact 120mm high, 135mm wide, and only 93mm long (excluding the steering shaft), the R3 is a pocket rocket of a wheelbase. Its boxy, industrial design gives it a serious motorsport aesthetic—far more race-ready-looking than some of the older, plastic clamshells that are out there competing.
The Moza R3 Racing Wheel and Pedals bundle is available fromPagnian ImportsandJB Hi-Fifor $549.95.
I also like that the ports on the back are neatly arranged for easy access, with slots for pedals, a dash display, a shifter, a handbrake, and even an emergency stop device. Out of the box, the only one you’ll need is the pedal port, but expansion is as easy as adding aftermarket mods to a project car. There are also two threaded holes up top for mounting Moza’s dash display.
Wheel-wise, the one you’re getting default here is a comfy D-shape affair with a grippy polyurethane wrapping. I like the feel of the clicky, short-throw paddle shifters that are crafted from sturdy black metal. And I dig that Moza allows for some customisation here—the brushed metal wheel rim is removable, and alternative rims are available to better serve your race discipline of choice.
Heading below the equator, we have the R3’s pedal set, which is only an accelerator and a brake. If you’re searching for a clutch experience—and that’d make perfect sense for OG muscle cars in Wreckfest 2—you can make an extra pit lane purchase of a third pedal. Prices seem to be reasonable for that, and I know from experience that Moza’s ecosystem is all about easy installation.
Beyond that, these metal pedals feel a heck of a lot more robust than some of the plastic-heavy alternatives on the market. Resistance comes from springs rather than a load cell, so while they’re not championship-grade, they should be more than enough for entry-level sim racers. There’s also a surprising degree of adjustability, with pedal pads that can be repositioned higher or lower, and the entire pedal units can be moved left or right.
With 3.9 Nm of peak torque, the R3 isn’t exactly a torque monster, but it’s right in the slipstream of other entry-level contenders with similar price pricepoints. It’s also perfect for some low-stakes, throw-around fun in a physics-heavy (yet nonetheless arcade-y) title like Wreckfest 2.I’m not going to lie to you, though; I did need to do some tinkering to make Wreckfest 2 speak correctly with the R3, at least initially. However, thanks to the ever-changing landscape of Early Access, a few hotfixes meant I no longer had to constantly rebind/reverse my pedals in Moza’s (usually quite capable) Pit House software. Everything works pretty much as it should now, and, obviously, support will only get better as yet more fixes roll out.
The R3’s FFB feels wonderful when you laterally thunk into other cars—typically when you’re using “dodgem cars” cornering logic to pinball past an apex while pinging some competitor off into a tree. Likewise, the feelings you get through the wheel when you’re on the receiving end of such tactics and are forced to shred through some random fence or tyre pile are nice and visceral.Car-nage collisions aside, I’d also be remiss if I didn’t highlight how satisfying a stretch of clean racing can be—that basic yet intimate FFB conversation between balding tyres and terra firma. Obviously, with Wreckfest 2 having closer DNA to a rally experience than a staid, single-surface track racer, every lap can (literally) feel like a series of plot twists. You’d better believe your hands will notice the difference when you drift in and out of bitumen to gravel to mud and back again.
Oh, and it goes without saying that any time there’s a momentary lull in any and all force feedback followed by a wrist-rattling jolt, that is just…well, a chef’s kiss experience. I can furnish you with two memorable examples of this. One, whenever you get some sick Dukes of Hazzard air and land on something you shouldn't have. And two, reversing from a bad corner upset, flicking into neutral, and then getting utterly and unexpectedly blindsided by some AI trying to break theland speedbump record through you.
Incidentally, I would like to say that POV racing in Wreckfest 2 with a decent FFB wheel such as this is the rough racing equivalent of a mini horror game. With your peripherals increasingly blinkered by the cabin of a crumpling car, every race is basically a series of untelegraphed jump scares that reach out and grab you through this wheel. Obviously this “driving on eggshells” sensation becomes more pronounced when you’re engaged in an actual demolition derby event, and some bastard has just bent your bonnet up over 80% of your windscreen.
I honestly shudder to think what those unexpected crashes will feel like for any gamer gripping a Moza R12 or higher. Those impacts you’ll get with 12 or 16 Nm worth of grunt will surely be the stuff of warning label justification. Hell, even a surprise bash through the 3.9 Nm force of the R3 delivers a respectable hand rattle. As unthinkable as it may sound, you may actually find yourself turning it down.All that being said, multiplying the Moza R3 Bundle with the Early Access antics of Wreckfest 2 is one of the funnest things I’ve done all year thus far. Even as a proud owner of a Moza R12 wheelbase and pretty much every fancy add-on that comes with it, I was impressed by the performance and value proposition of this younger brother bundle. If you have budget aspirations of joining the simming scene—or you just wannafeelstuff crash harder than a stock market after tariffs—I say turn the key on an R3."
"If your wallet has been pleading for mercy, it might just have to hold on a little longer because today’s gaming deals are too good to ignore. Whether you're into high-speed hijinks, fantasy epics, or quirky co-op chaos, there's something to tempt every kind of gamer. With discounts this tempting, now’s the time to grab a controller, a mouse, or a magic paintbrush and dive into something new!

In retro news, I'm using a NOS burst to light 26 candles on a cake forNeed For Speed: High Stakes. This beloved racing game wasn't just about sating one's velocity requirements while unlocking new whips; lose a High Stakes race, and you'd perma-lose your car. Us launch adopters loved that risk-versus-reward structure and the groundbreaking damage system that would go on to influence the future of racing simulations.
Better yet, we had I highly localised Aussie version with Holden VT Clubsport and Ford AU Falcon XR8 featured prominently on the cover. Even cooler, winning the special HSV Pro Cup would unlock Craig Lowndes' MHRT VT Commo'. Using it to evade the fuzz down Durham Road (preferably in split-screen PvP) was mighty boss stuff.

"No Man’s Skydeveloper Hello Games has detailed its latest update, Relics, which lets players become palaeontologists by digging up the skeletal remains of alien creatures. It’s out now across PC, console, and VR for free.

When new bones are discovered, players can piece them together to their own design, Hello Games explained. They can even create their own museums, or share their collections with other players.
“There is a truly huge variety of procedural prehistoric bones, in all shapes and sizes, to excavate and collect,” Hello Games added.
“It’s up to you how you reassemble them and there’s a lot of fun to be had building ever-more outrageous skeletons to put on display in your bases-turned-museums or share with your fellow Travellers.
“Fossils out there to be discovered vary hugely in rarity, so you never quite know what you’re going to unearth. There’s a real buzz when you find something truly rare. The most uncommon finds hold huge value. For those trying desperately to finish their collection, we introduced a specialist who can be bartered with at the Space Station.”
Alongside the launch of Relics is a community expedition focusing on palaeontology, which challenges players to compete for the rarest finds.
“Players should be wary where they choose to excavate though,” Hello Games warned.
“Some things have been buried for a reason. Dangerous creatures guard the greatest treasure and may be awoken from their slumber, including Stone Ghosts, and the colossal Stone Golem. New creatures have been introduced too, along with their skeletons. Including the awesome skeletal Titan Worm!”
No Man’s Sky continues to receive free updates even now, years after launch. And it’s clearly keeping players interested. Hello Games saidthe recently released Worlds Part II updatefueled some of No Man’s Sky’s highest player numbers early in the year.
In November,Hello Games hailed No Man’s Sky hitting a ‘very positive’ Steam user review user ratingfor the first time, eight years after the game’s controversial launch was slammed by players.
No Man’s Sky launched in August 2016 on PS4 and PC to tens of thousands of negative reviews on Steam, with players complaining about broken promises and a lack of meaningful content, particularly on the multiplayer side. The game quickly settled on the dreaded ‘overwhelmingly negative’ Steam user review rating, a clear sign to anyone who visited its Steam page that something was very wrong.
But Guildford, England-based developer Hello Games has continued to update No Man’s Sky over the years, improving player sentiment to the point where it is now considered superb. It took two years to hit ‘mixed,’ then another three to hit ‘mostly positive.’ At the time, five years after launch, Tim Woodley, Head of Publishing at Hello Games,explained how hard it was to claw back Steam user reviews from such a low base.
As Hello Games continues to work on No Man’s Sky, it’s developing its next game,Light No Fire. It's about adventure, building, survival and exploration together, set on a fantasy planet the size of Earth.

"Although Bleach is the flashiest member of the shonen anime “big three,” standing shoulder to shoulder with mega-popular series like One Piece and Naruto, it has long suffered from middle child syndrome when it comes to arena fighter adaptations. Bleach Rebirth of Souls aims to break the cycle ofrun-of-the-mill anime fightersthis series has previously been part of, delivering a unique action game that attempts to raise the genre to greater heights. Its story mode is admittedly an uneven jumble, ricocheting back and forth between a laughable attempt at a visual novel cobbled together like a last-second afterthought and a visually striking and stylish spectacle, as Bleach should be. But developer Tamsoft's herculean effort to enrich Rebirth of Souls with complex combat (with some room for improvement) saves it from being just another fly-by-night arena fighter.

It’s easy to get overloaded by a bunch of confusing anime jargon as Rebirth of Souls’ tutorial explains how its health bar, counters, and super moves work, but here’s the quick way to understand things: This is a 3D arena fighter with Super Smash Bros.’s life stock system, Sekiro’s stance-breaking swordplay, and Bleach’s unique visual flair. Unlike other arena fighters, which often have combat so shallow you only need to find a single combo or spam super moves to win matches, Bleach's combat feels like a challenging game of tug-of-war – one where victories are clinched rather than mindlessly stomped out of your opponents.
Each sword swing feels snappy and weighty as you teleport around the screen, ambushing your enemies from behind and breaking their guard. It never gets old to see large blocks of text wrap around freeze-framed characters with every successfully landed counter and super move. Even when you play Rebirth of Souls on its Standard Mode button layout, which streamlines things by letting you dish out flashy auto-combos, it harbors a wink of complex and unique mechanics specific to each character that warrant further exploration. That could be Shinji's counter-heavy moveset or the in-your-face brawler style of my personal favorite, Soi Fon – it’s so satisfying to stun lock opponents whenever she zips all over the place with a flurry of punches and kicks. Plus, her super move is a massive missile arm canon that she has hunker down to fire, which is too enticing a contradiction to pass up as a main.
However, Standard Mode matches do have a samey button rhythm to them after a while without much expression outside of mashing light and heavy button combos into a super. Having two move inputs that double as a distance closer alongside often unreliable ranged attacks does not make for a remarkable competitive game. It also doesn't help that the movement feels oddly stiff, with slow dashes and a scarcity of defensive options. Typically, whenever you're getting your ass kicked, fighting games bail you out by filling up your meter that effectively allows you to take some pressure off with a flashy super or counter. Other arena fighters like Naruto and Dragon Ball get around these counter move deficits by giving you a dedicated button to charge your super bars or spend portions of your meter for last second teleportations to avoid disaster.
In contrast, outside of two defensive retaliation mechanics called Awakenings and Reversals (with the former activating as a late-game transformation to buff your damage), the only way to build your super move or flash step teleports in Rebirth of Soils is tied to having dealt enough combos in the first place. The limited defensive mechanics grow even more dire when successfully blocking an opponent's offensive onslaught can be immediately undone by them comboing into a guard breaker — which should be virtually unheard of in any self respecting fighting game.
All of the above makes the back and forth of Standard Mode matches a bit tiring as you wait for a flash step bar to come back or pray you don't get whiff punished into oblivion thanks to a weird attack range. Thankfully, playing Rebirth of Souls in Manual Mode alleviates a lot of the restrictiveness those training wheels can cause, giving you the ability to mix together (or cancel out of) a variety of light and heavy combos into metered special moves. That makes Manual feel like the “intended” way to play if you’re looking for a more serious fighter because you aren't limited to a light and heavy combo string with the occasional super move punctuation mark. Manual Mode allows you to cancel out combos on a dime and deliver an infinite string of attacks, letting you effectively express yourself as you learn what assortment of attacks will deal the most damage while looking good doing so. That said, it could still do with more optimization to things like sluggish dashes, inconsistent attack range hit confirmations, and a deficit of defensive movements to make matches feel less rigid and constrictive.
As a massive fan of the Bleach anime and manga's stunning artistry, stirring character development, and shocking plot twists, I had high hopes that Rebirth of Souls could deliver a worthwhile story mode. Sadly, it's a bit of a mixed bag. By and large, cutscenes in an anime fighter should act as a sparkly reward at the end of battle, meant to bring the momentum of a fight to a thrilling climax. At the best of times, like in theNaruto: Ultimate Ninja Stormseries, they can be so well animated that they could substitute for watching the actual shows. That is not always the case with Rebirth of Souls – if anything, they nearly bring things to a screeching and embarrassing halt where you're not sure if you're meant to laugh on purpose or not.
The look of combat clearly had a lot of tender love and care put into it, but the story moments between that action instead play out like a cheap visual novel. Outside of a few pre-rendered cutscenes, the SparkNotes version of the anime this story mode attempts to tell is a rushed, hobbled mess. Instead of being greeted by bombastic scenes where my favorite characters clash, I was met with Machinima-looking animations where in-game models would fart out energy waves at each other and stiffly fall to the ground. Even the emotionally heady scenes lose all sense of tension as its characters move around like clumsy action figures with limited points of articulation in bright, low-poly arenas. What's more, exciting moments like sword clashes and beam struggles lose all of their gravitas as these scenes incessantly cut to black with bright slashes on the screen that look less like a creative choice for dramatic effect and more like a placeholder for an animation that wasn’t added in time.
If this was a genuine attempt to resemble a visual novel, it definitely missed the mark, as it feels more like an unfinished first draft – and with review codes less than a day before launch, it’s hard not to see this as an intentional hope that fans will buy-in based solely on the goodwill of the franchise. Which is a shame, because both its English and Japanese voice cast are putting in work with their vocal performances and the character models are faithful recreations that do look great in action. As if Bandai Namco took pointers fromInvincible season 2’s jokeabout how animators cut corners to make more scenes, Rebirth of Souls put all of its focus on the fights, and every moment outside of them looks like a fan-made animator’s first crack at recreating the anime as a result.
At the same time, however, Tamsoft is weirdly able to weaponize its limited, awkward looking cutscenes to drive home the charm of Bleach's filler episodes. Moments of levity during a handful of original story mode chapters where characters take a break from slashing each other to play high-stakes games of soccer, go on haunted house dates, or rinse each other at fighting games have the right kind of jank to their slapstick animation. These periodic excursions are disarmingly charming to watch. Side characters who'd otherwise be ignored on Rebirth of Souls roster like Shuhei or Izuru get more dimension to them, encouraging you to invest time in learning how to play them because of how compelling and personable their slice-of-life segments are.
Bleach Rebirth of Souls’ combat surpasses the typical anime arena fighter thanks to its intricate battle system and the effort that has been invested in making each character feel unique with their distinct play styles. Although the theatrics of its story mode do not consistently match the spectacle of its crisp character models, the vibrant sword slashes and stylish typography accompanying each super move help compensate for those shortcomings. Despite not fully delivering on its ambitious promise to elevate anime arena fighters to new heights, Rebirth of Souls is still a welcome latecomer to the genre for this series."
"Indiana Jones and the Great Circlehas a PlayStation 5 rating onthe website of the Entertainment Software Rating Board, suggesting a release date isn’t too far away.

MachineGames’ well-received action adventure game launched on Xbox Series X and S and PC in December 2024, and currently has a spring 2025 release window on PS5. That suggests the game will be out at some point in the next few months.
Microsoft has so far remained quiet on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s PS5 release date, preferring to focus on other games at its recent Xbox Developer Direct showcase. But it seems an announcement will be made soon.
MachineGames has issued a series of updates since the game’s initial Xbox launch,most recently fixing various bugs and adding support for Nvidia DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Ray Reconstruction on PC. The PS5 version will of course feature all the console updates released to date.
Boosted by launching day one on Game Pass, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has so farreached 4 million players— a figure that will no doubt see a significant boost one the PS5 version goes live.
Indiana Jones actor Harrison Ford has saidTroy Baker playing the beloved character in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is proof ""you don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul.""
Ford discussed alleviating control of Indy withThe Wall Street Journal, saying he was very happy with the performance of The Last of Us actor Baker.
""You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul,"" Ford said. ""You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent. He did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.""

"Silent Hill f has been announced for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with an as-yet-unannounced release date. The game takes place in 1960s Japan, where it will present players with “a beautiful yet terrifying choice.” In the trailer, we see hero Shimizu Hinako encounter the franchise’s famous fog, along with various terrors, as they descent upon the town. The game is now available for preorder (see it at Amazon). Read on for the details.

PS5
Xbox
PC
In an unusual move for a AAA game, no special or deluxe editions have been announced for Silent Hill f. The standard edition is the only choice, which I find kind of refreshing, actually.
While no universal preorder bonuses are available for Silent Hill f, Best Buy has one for its paid members. My Best Buy Plus and Total members will receive a free $10 Best Buy gift card for preordering the game. You cansign up herestarting at $49.99 per year.
Silent Hill f is a new installment in the long-running franchise that’s set in 1960s Japan, making it a good place for newcomers to the series to jump in. However, it’s not for the faint of heart: it containsgruesome scenes of violence and gorethat won’t be appreciated by everyone. If you’re not a horror person, or you’re squeamish when you see platters of entrails, for instance, you may want to steer clear of this one.

While Sony used to offer free trials for new users to its online service,PlayStation Plus does not currently offer any free trials.
Although PlayStation Plus doesn't offer free trials to everyone, certain countries or regions may occasionally have access to alimited-time free trial according to Sony's website. Unfortunately, Sony doesn't reveal exactlywhothese free trials are for orwhenthey are available, so you'll need to keep your eyes peeled. PlayStation also occasionally hasfree multiplayer eventswith no PS Plus subscription required, although these are often unpredictable.
PlayStationdoeshaveoccasional deals on PlayStation Plus subscriptions, however, they are oftenonly available for new or expired members. Come on, Sony, share the love!
There really isn't adirectreplacement for PS Plus as it's required for online play on PS5 and PS4, but there are some alternatives with free (or close to free) trials that offer a catalog of games to stream, if you so desire. However, most (if not all) of these alternatives require either a different console, a PC, or a mobile device to use the service.
Other services like Ubisoft+ and EA Play feature publisher-specific catalogs of games to stream, but they don't currently offer any free trials.

"As part of its Spring Sale, SteelSeries is taking 35% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets. The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Destiny 2 in-game items.

The SteelSeries Nova 7 is the latest successor to the highly rated Arctis 7 series of headsets. It's every bit as good as its predecessor but with some welcome upgrades like a USB Type-C charging port, a longer battery life (38 hours vs. 30 hours), simultaneous wireless and Bluetooth connectivity, and multi-platform compatibility. PC gamers also have access to the SteelSeries GG app, which opens up a whole suite of customization for your audio. If that's too much for you, there are presets for specific games that are actually tailormade by the game developers. For PS5 gamers, the Nova 7 is also compatible with the PlayStation 5's Tempest 3D Audio.
The Arctis Nova 7 is one of thebest headsetsyou can get forPS5and PC. In hisNova 7 review, Matthew Adler wrote that ""SteelSeries continues to push the boundaries of what a headset is capable of. With the addition of simultaneous Bluetooth audio, you can enjoy music, podcasts, or just chat with your friends without losing your game audio – all with a single pair of headphones. The Arctis Nova 7’s new design is sleek, lightweight, and still remains one of the most comfortable headsets I’ve ever used."" I own a pair of these myself and highly recommend it.

"If you're looking for a new gaming monitor but you're on a tight budget, then this deal is right up your alley. Amazon is currently offering a27"" KTC gaming monitorfor only $92.99 shipped after you clip a $40 off coupon on the product page and apply another $7 off coupon code: ""05DMKTC38"". This item has over 1,800 reviews on Amazon with an average 4.4/5 star score and a respectableFakespot ""B"" rating. It has plenty of gaming features you wouldn't expect at this price point.

The KTC H27T13 is a 27"" monitor with a 2560x1440 resolution, which averages out to a sharp 109ppi pixel density. It's equipped with a pre-calibrated IPS panel with good color reproduction and wide viewing angles. It's decently fast with a refresh rate up to 100Hz and G-Sync compatibility. KTC includes a 3 year warranty.
If you're considering this monitor, chances are you're pairing it with a budget gaming PC setup. You probably don't need an expensive monitor with a 4K resolution that will overly tax your PC or 240Hz refresh rate that will be hard to achieve. G-Sync technology, however, is especially useful for these budget builds, since your fps is more likely to fluctuate than higher-end builds and adaptive sync helps provide a smoother and tear-free experience. This is a good monitor to pair with something like an RTX 4060, 4070, 5070, or the new Radeon RX 9070 GPU.

"Dinosaur survival gameArk 2, which some had suspected might have run into trouble or even been abandoned, is back on after developer Studio Wildcard revealed a new expansion forArk: Survival Ascendedthat leads into the sequel.

Ark: Lost Colony is the first original expansion pack for Ark 1 remake Ark: Survival Ascended, and its reveal trailer, below, was produced by anime studio Mappa (Jujutsu Kaisen, Attack on Titan, Chainsaw Man) and stars voiceover by the Michelle Yeoh, who reprises her role as Mei Yin from Ark: The Animated Series.
Studio Wildcard said the expansion will feature numerous cinema-grade anime story sequences created by Mappa. Here’s the official blurb:
In its note to press, Studio Wildcard said Ark: Lost Colony “directly connects” the storylines of Ark’s Extinction and Genesis expansions and leads into the events of Ark 2.
Ark 2 is the Unreal Engine 5-powered sequel to the hugely successfulArk Survival Evolved. It was first announced with a surprise Vin Diesel cameo at The Game Awards 2020, at the time with a 2022 release date, but it was later delayed into 2023. Then, earlier in 2023,Ark 2 was delayed again, this time to late 2024 as an Xbox Series X and S console exclusive, day-one on Game Pass, and on PC via Steam and Windows.
As recently as December 2023,Studio Wildcard was still insisting Ark 2 was on track for a late 2024 release window. Obviously that didn’t happen, sparking concern from fans. So this announcement, coming three months into 2025, will help reassure fans that Ark 2 is still in the works, although Studio Wildcard failed to provide an updated release window.
We do have firmer details for Ark: Lost Colony, however. Pre-orders kick off in June 2025, and all purchases immediately unlock exclusive Ark: Lost Colony preview gameplay content. A full release is set for November 2025, with Ark: Lost Colony priced at $29.99 for Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, and PC.

"PlayStation or Xbox? It’s the long-running question of the modern video game world. At one point or another in your life, you’ve almost certainly been a part of this debate. Maybe you’ve started a Reddit thread, or made a TikTok video, or struck up a heated chat between friends about it. While therearegamers who preach the PC gospel, and Nintendo-as-god fanatics, much of the last two decades of video game history has been made as a result of Sony and Microsoft’s ongoing tete-a-tete. But is this ‘console war’ truly still being waged? The video game industry has gone through immense change in the last year, let alone over the previous two decades. Gamers’ habits, preferences, and options have all increased exponentially in part thanks to the rise of handheld gaming and younger generations’ expertise in building their own gaming machines. The battlefield is now practically unrecognisable compared to its tribal-like origins, but has a victor finally emerged from the trenches? Possibly – but the answer may surprise you.

The video game industry has rapidly evolved to become a financial juggernaut in recent years. In 2019, its worldwide revenue was $285 billion. Last year, it was $475 billion. That figure means that video games made more than the entire world wide movie and music industries in 2023, which made$308 billionand$28.6 billionrespectively. There’s no sign of this growth stopping, either. By 2029, the industry is estimated to generate nearly$700 billion. Not bad considering its humble Pong origins.
All this considered, it’s no surprise that we’ve seen an uptick in Hollywood actors flocking to be a part of a scene with such a lucrative present and future. Mads Mikkelsen, Keanu Reeves, Jon Bernthal and Willem Dafoe to name a few have all starred in games released in the past five years. Their involvement reflects the monumental shift in the perception of video games. Even industry titans like Disney are making significant in-roads into gaming, havingjust invested $1.5 billion into Epic Gamesas part of Bob Iger’s second term challenge to solidify a gaming presence for the company. A rising tide should lift all boats – unless you’re aboard the U.S.S. Microsoft, which seems to have sprung a leak.
The Xbox Series X and S consoles are intended to be an upgrade from the Xbox One in every way. But their advancements have yet to prove truly enticing; the One currently ranks above the Series X/S by almost double the sales. When you couple this fact with comments from analytics company Circana’s games industry expert, Mat Piscatella, who hassuggested that this current console generation is now past its selling peak, it paints a worrying picture for team Xbox. Things appear even worse when you look at console sales figures from 2024. According to Statista, the Xbox Series X/Ssold less than 2.5 million units across the entire year– the PlayStation 5sold the same figure in the first quarter of 2024 alone. There are also the allegations that Xbox is supposedly closing down its department which handles the manufacture and delivery of games to physical retailers, which feels ominously connected to itsevasive responseto areport that it plans to pull out of selling consoles in the EMEA region. If Xbox really has been involved in a ‘console war’, all of this points to the signal to retreat.
But Xbox isn't retreating – it has already surrendered. During the long Activision-Blizzard acquisition process, a statement from Microsoft found in the findings of fact revealed that the company doesn’t believe its Xbox division lost the console war –it thinks it never had a shot to begin with. So, what does a company built around a video game console do when its newest model is struggling to match its predecessor in sales, and its parent company openly remarks on its failure? It gets out of the console business.
It's no secret that Xbox Game Pass has become a key priority for the company.Leaked internal documentsrevealed the estimated prices Xbox expected to be asked to pay to put AAA-titles like Grand Theft Auto 5 ($12-15 million per month) and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor ($300 million) on the subscription service. Xbox taking such costs seriously demonstrates the company consolidating cloud gaming as a key direction for it moving forward. That goal is clear to see in Microsoft’s recent ‘This Is An Xbox’ advertising campaign, which suggests the company is keen to redefine how players think of Xbox – no longer a console, but an always-accessible service with some hardware to complement it instead.
It seems like this rethinking of what an Xbox is means that the brand’s official hardware won’t be limited to being a box under your TV. An Xbox handheld has been rumored to be in development for the past year or so, backed by another leaked document from the Activision-Blizzard dealings which hints at using handheld-friendly hardware for a next-gen'hybrid cloud gaming platform'. But Microsoft’s pivot in strategy has hardly been a secret. From its announcement of plans to createa mobile game storeto compete with Apple and Google, to Xbox chief Phil Spencer’s own admission that mobile gaming’s dominance in the sphere is shaping the company’s own path moving forward, the new M.O. seems simple: Xbox is the video game brand you can play whenever you want, wherever you are.
So why is Microsoft pivoting? Sure, Xbox has struggled over the past couple of generations, but doesn’t the video game console market reign supreme? You’d be surprised. In 2024, of the total 3.3 billion estimated video gamers,over 1.93 billion of them play via a mobile device. That, of course, includes your grandmother playing Candy Crush Saga and your “non-gamer” cousin who still clocks up hours of Clash of Clans. But mobile gaming is now so much more than these casual audiences – over the last decade it has quickly become the dominant pillar of the video game market among every generation, but especially Gen Z and Gen Alpha. In 2024, thetotal market valuation for the video game industrywas $184.3 billion, with mobile games comprising exactly half of that entire figure at $92.5 billion (a 2.8% increase from the previous year). Where do consoles weigh in? At just $50.3 billion, or 27%, and that’s dropped 4% since 2023. No wonder Microsoft wants to turn your phone into an Xbox.
But this isn’t a new development. By 2013, the Asian market for mobile gaming was already dwarfing that of the western world by heights of 759% in South Korea and 280% in China. You might think GTA 5 was the most profitable game of 2013, but you’d be wrong: Both Puzzle & Dragon and Candy Crush Saga outperformed Rockstar’s juggernaut by $1.5 and $1.4 billion respectively. Take a wide-angle lens to the 2010s as a whole for video games, and you’ll find that five of the highest-grossing games were mobile games – Crossfire, Monster Strike, Honor of Kings, Puzzle & Dragon, and Clash of Clans. When you look back on the decade, I highly doubt any of these titles immediately spring to mind – and yet, I’m sure most reading this have the start-up music for Clash of Clans seared into their brains.
Phones are not the only platform drawing attention away from consoles. While not as significant as mobile gaming’s explosion, it’s clear to see that player habits have shifted toward a greater appreciation for PC gaming. Since 2014, there has been a year-on-year growth of 59 million new PC players, taking us from 1.31 billion in 2014 to1.86 billion in 2024. It’s worth noting this rise is complimented by a gargantuan 200 million in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic, during which streaming became a very attractive pastime for many house-bound players. But regardless of if Twitch called to them or not, gamers have become more technologically literate, educated by their peers online on how to build a PC powerhouse, what the best GPUs are, and how to overclock your circuit-ware. As a result, the PC’s global share of the video game market in 2024 lands at $41.5 billion – so it won’t be long until the PC battleline overtakes the army of console players, right? Well, maybe not.Netzoo’s 2016 Global Games Market Value reportdefined a $2.3 billion gap between console and PC – but in 2024, that gap has increased to $9 billion. So despite the rise of more advanced GPUs, circuit-boards, and Gen Z and Alpha’s technological craftiness, it’s a market that’s on thefallrather than the rise – at least for now. If that fall continues, it's not great news for Xbox, which has made Windows PCs its second home.
But it’s not just the dominance of mobile and the uncertain future of PC that Xbox has to contend with. Wars typically have two opposing sides, so it’s about time we looked at where PlayStation fits into this console war. Luckily for Sony, things are going pretty well. In its latest quarterly earnings report, Sony revealed75 million PS5s have been sold to date– that’s a big lead ahead of the combined 29.7 million sales for the Xbox Series X/S. The gap between the two consoles is widening, too; stats suggest that for every one Xbox Series X/S bought during November 2024,five PlayStation 5 consoles were also purchased(a ratio no doubt helped by the launch of the PS5 Pro.) Sony’s Game and Network Services also saw a healthy 12.3% bump in its profits during the final months of 2024, helped specifically by healthy first-party sales including Astro Bot selling 1.5 million copies in under two months, and lifetime sales for Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut surpassing 13 million. The future looks very bright for the PS5. Ampere Analysis’ games research director, Piers Harding-Rolls,estimates that by 2029, Sony will have sold 106.9 million consoles. How do things look for the Xbox Series X/S’s future? Well, leaked Microsoft documents estimate that by 2027,it expects to have sold around 56-59 million units. While it’s not a directly comparable projection, it’s not good. In order for Microsoft to re-establish its competitive edge in the current market, it will need to close the 5:1 PlayStation-to-Xbox gap, significantly increase the number of units sold year-on-year, and also bolster the profitability of its exclusives. Projections don’t support a positive outcome for those first two requirements, and given Phil Spencer’s ‘no red lines’ mantra on Xbox titles coming to PlayStation and Switch (possibly even including the next Halo title), the argument could be made that PlayStation is already the King of Console.
But looking at the PS5 in isolation paints a different picture. 50% of all PlayStation users arecurrently still playing on older PS4sinstead of PS5s, despite the newest generation now entering the second half of its life-cycle. Why is this? Well, of the top 20 best-selling games in the U.S. in 2024, only one is truly PS5-exclusive – Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, at #19. Helldivers 2 does feature at #3 but was also playable on PC at launch. Looking beyond last year, if we disregard remasters of PS4 games, there are roughly 15 genuine PS5-exclusive games on the console as a whole. There’s little here to justify the console’s price in many people’s eyes.
If the PS5 is struggling to justify its regular $500 price tag, then it's understandable why the $700 PS5 Pro debuted to a mixed reception to say the least. The general consensus amongst tech journalists is that perhaps this upgrade came tooearlywithin the cycle, especially given the games advertised in its campaign were slightly upscaled generation-old remasters. WhenIGN polled its readers, the result was overwhelmingly clear – the PS5 Pro has little to offer for forking over that much cash. So, simply put, the PS5 simply isn’t a must-buy console – at least, not yet. This will undoubtedly change when the behemoth that is Grand Theft Auto 6 finally releases later this year, which is almost guaranteed to become the shining star of this generation and the first chance for the PS5 to show off its true power.
So, is the console war over? If you’re Microsoft, it would appear there was never any belief that there was a chance to battle Sony for supremacy. If you’re Sony, your new console has become a success but lacks the true pedigree to be claimed as a new leap forward yet, feeling more like a bunny hop than anything else. The true winner of the console war seems to be those who chose not to play it at all. Rumors of mobile gaming companies encroaching onto the traditional console gaming sphere will only ramp up in the years to come, with Tencent rumored to be in talks to buy out Ubisoft from the Guillemot brothers, having already purchased Sumo Group in 2021. Mobile gaming is becoming increasingly pivotal to the sustainability and profitability of these companies – Take-Two Interactive claim that 10% of the world’s population plays its subsidiary Zynga’s games every month. That means that it’s more than likely that your grandma playing Zynga Poker and Words with Friends 2 is funding the continued development of Grand Theft Auto 6 – not a sentence you would expect to read five years ago, but one reflective of the new state of play of the video game market. The next five years of video gaming history will be defined less and less by who has the most powerful hardware, and more about whose cloud gaming server farm can expand the quickest and strongest. The console war is over, but the mobile gaming war (and the myriad of smaller conflicts that inevitably spin out of it) has only begun.

"I didn’t think we’d see a proper Pokémon TCG restock this early in 2025. Honestly, I was betting on summer at best, but here we are with actual product showing up on Amazon and not behind some sketchy paywalled Discord server. While the internet’s currently losing its mind over Prismatic Evolutions and burning money chasing stock alerts for Rival Destinies, the smart play is scooping up the older sets that just hit Amazon Global. We’re talking Scarlet and Violet era stuff, Sword and Shield throwbacks, and boxes that were basically extinct six months ago.

This is the kind of flood the TCG community needed. Not just for collectors trying to complete sets, but for anyone who’s tired of battling bots for ETBs like it’s the Hunger Games. There’s a real mix available right now: Booster Bundles, Premium Collections, tins with actual storage value. And yes, even a few deals that make it feel like Amazon’s trying to keep the vibe positive. If you’re chasing big pulls like Greninja SIR or Pikachu ex SIR, or just need to stock up on sleeves and dice, this is the best stock refreshes we’ve seen in a while.
AliExpress is currently offering theSony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphonesfor only $225.18 after coupon code:IFP7FJZis applied during checkout. This product is stocked in a US warehouse, so it ships free and arrives within about a week. This is an import model with a warranty that won't be honored in the United States. AliExpress makes up for it with a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days.
In our glowingSony WH1000XM5 review, Kevin Lee wrote that ""The Sony WH-1000XM5 is hands down the best sounding and most impressive noise-canceling headphones around. They demand a high premium but the cost of audio excellence is well worth it with this pair of headphones.""
The real deal here is the fact that theTwilight MasqueradeElite Trainer Box is actually in stock. Seeing it available without a 200% markup or sketchy third-party seller feels borderline miraculous. You’re getting nine booster packs, a full-art Teal Mask Ogerpon promo, and all the usual ETB goodies like energy cards, condition markers, and themed sleeves.
It’s not every day you seeBrilliant StarsBuild and Battle Boxes in stock, let alone without having to navigate the wild west of resale sites. At $63.34, this one comes with four booster packs and a pre-release promo card, which makes it a solid pickup for collectors looking to flesh out their Sword and Shield era sets. Arceus VSTAR headlines the expansion, and the pull potential here still holds up.
Among Us 4-Pack on Steam is a sneaky little deal that gives you four copies of the game for the price of one, making it dangerously easy to rope your friends into a night of trust issues and vent-related betrayal. It supports cross-platform play, customizable settings, and chaotic emergency meetings that usually end with the wrong person getting ejected. If you’ve somehow missed the social deduction chaos, now’s the perfect time to catch up and take three crewmates down with you.
TheHisuian Electrode V Boxis back in stock at Amazon for $42.45, which is a win considering how sporadically these pop up. It's one of those V boxes that slipped under the radar when it first launched, but now that Sword and Shield-era product is drying up it’s worth grabbing. You get a foil Hisuian Electrode V promo, a regular Electrode foil, an oversized version (because why not), and four booster packs to rip through.
This limited-edition snack box is a flavor-packed tribute toAssassin’s Creed Shadows, blending premium Japanese treats with collectible game merch in a way that feels like an edible side quest. You get 15 unique snacks, a full bag of exclusive Kit Kats, a custom Tenugui towel, and even an in-game item called The Hourglass that’s only available through this box. With artwork prints, a detailed snack guide, and a box sleeve that transforms into a display-worthy poster, it’s more than just snacks.
Seeing theShining FatesPikachu V Box on Amazon again feels like spotting a shiny in the wild. At $49.96 it’s not exactly a steal, but having it in stock is the real value. This box comes with a foil Pikachu V promo, an oversized version for flair, and four Shining Fates booster packs. That means a legit shot at pulls from one of the most hype-filled sets of the Sword and Shield era.
TheSurging SparksBooster Bundle is actually in stock at Amazon for $47.95, which is kind of a miracle considering how fast this set’s been disappearing. You get six booster packs from the newest Scarlet and Violet expansion, which includes some major chase cards like Pikachu ex SIR and Latias ex. If you missed the chaos of launch day or couldn’t snag a bundle without battling bots, this is your chance to catch up.
I want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.
This phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.
I can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.
RimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.
This SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.
I never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.
I think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.
The games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art. The remastered soundtracks, modernized UI, and quality-of-life improvements bring these classics into the modern age while keeping their original charm intact.

A genuine Apple leather case for $11.99? That’s not a typo. It’s an 80% discount. Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.
If you’re tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.
Why buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.
If you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.
Still using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.
These aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.
These Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.
Luxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.
This isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.
For those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says ""powerful Pokémon"" like an angry robot penguin).
I'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.
If somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.
Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).
If you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, ""I really need to delete some games,"" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.
Samsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room. The Acoustic Lens Subwoofer ensures deep, punchy bass, while Adaptive Sound and Game Mode Pro make sure everything from dialogue to explosions sounds crisp. At $764 off, this is the cheapest we’ve seen it outside of Black Friday.
LG B4 OLED TVbrings incredible picture quality at a price that doesn’t require selling a kidney.

Gamers get Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and VRR, plus four HDMI 2.1 ports. At $499.99, this is one of the best deals for an OLED right now.
Samsung’s S90D OLED TVis a beast, packing AI-powered 4K upscaling, Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for silky smooth gameplay, and Dolby Atmos for immersive sound. Real Depth Enhancer makes everything look more lifelike, and PANTONE validation ensures accurate color reproduction. At $300 off, this is a great price for a high-end 65” OLED TV.
Sony’s WH-CH520 headphonesoffer 50 hours of battery life, customizable sound settings, and a lightweight, comfortable design. Multipoint connection makes switching between devices seamless, and DSEE upscaling improves compressed audio. At just $35.95, these are one of the best budget wireless headphones out there today.
Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 bring top-tier noise cancellation, a Tensor A1 chip for AI-powered audio enhancements, and large 11mm drivers for rich bass. Conversation Detection automatically switches to transparency mode when you talk, so you don’t have to take them out. If you need premium wireless earbuds, this is asolid deal for these 9/10 buds.
Enshrouded is a survival RPG with deep crafting, intense combat, and massive co-op potential. Play solo or team up with up to 16 friends, build custom bases, and fight through a dark, mysterious world. It’s still in early access, but at $23.99, it’s worth jumping in now aswe gave it 8/10.

In retro news, I'm celebrating the 21st birthday of a series black sheep that still sold many a GameCube,Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. As a remake of the '98 PS classic, this was a pretty surreal (and, in parts, misguided) love letter. It was as if Snake had emerged from a time machine, equipped with the control scheme and acrobatics ofMGS 2: Sons of Liberty. Helmed by Silicon Knights and injected with the ""cinematic flair"" of Hollywood action director Ryuhei Kitamura, the end result divided fans quicker than a cyber-ninja disarming Ocelot.
Upgrades like first-person aiming and being able to hang/drop from ledges were a double-edged sword. While they made Snake more powerful and adaptable, they also turned sections of his Shadow Moses op into a cakewalk. The level design, originally built for the PS1’s limitations, just wasn’t fully rebalanced to accommodate these new mechanics, and some re-recorded voice performances weren't ideal. Be that as it Mei [Ling], I still recall loving this at launch and adore the copy I own.

PC gamers have some stellar choices today. Cyberpunk 2077 ($36, down 60%) is the comeback king of gaming, having gone from a rocky launch to one of the most critically praised RPGs of recent years. And if you prefer grand strategy, Stellaris ($16, down 77%) is a steal. Paradox originally pitched this as “Crusader Kings in space”, and true to that vision, you can create everything from benevolent galactic federations to nightmarish cybernetic hiveminds.

"Thank your own personal deity—possibly Kratos—it’s Friday! Even though it’s Autumn for Aussies, it’s time to spring into ludicrous Spring Salesavings on Steam. If the picks of that litter don’t interest you, I’ve sniffed out console-based bargains on grand adventures, pulse-pounding action, or quirky indie gems; there’s a little something for everyone.

In retro news, I'm (somehow) celebrating the 23rd birthday of the OG Xbox, a console that blew my mind at launch (even though I was happily married to a PS2). This was the chunky vehicle that brought Microsoft into the console gaming world. And while it didn't have the prettiest design or the greatest library of games, it gave us two important contributions to gaming:Haloand Xbox Live.
While some N64 enthusiasts may argue thatGoldenEyepaved the way for quality console first-person shooters, it wasHalothat revolutionised the genre. Almost every FPS that came after Halo utilised its control scheme and a modified version of its health system. But where Halo truly succeeded was in providing console gamers with the first-of-its-kind 16-player LAN battles. This was the first shooter that made my PC gaming mates jealous, and I still own and adore myLimited Edition Crystal Xbox. Even though ants once tried to take it over and turn it into a very expensive vivarium.

"Monster Hunter WildsTitle Update 1 goes live tonight or tomorrow, depending on where you are in the world, and ahead of its release date, Capcom has published the patch notes so players can get a peek at what's in store.

Over on theMonster Hunter site, the patch notes lay out everything for Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1. Some of this is info that's already been unveiled in previous streams, like theMonster Hunter Wilds showcase. But a few details spotlight the changes being made, both in the world and under the hood.
Title Update 1 goes live on Friday April 4, 2025 at 3am UTC / Thursday April 3, 2025 8pm PT. Capcom also provided the required space for the update:
It is Monster Hunter after all, so the new content and hunts take priority.Mizutsunearrives for HR 21 and up hunters in Title Update 1, while aTemperedMizutsune will arrive for HR 41 and up hunters after completing the extra Mizutsune mission. The big bad Zoh Shia is now a high-rank monster, with a story mission unlocking Zoh Shia at HR 50.
Additionally, new story, extra, and side missions will be added, as well as new weapons, armor, and skills. The upgrade limit has been increased for armor of rarity 5 and above, too.
The Grand Hub, an endgame gathering location for hunters. It can be unlocked by doing a tutorial mission appearing once you've hit HR 16, and will host Barrel Bowling, the Arena Quest Counter, the Canteen, the Arm Wrestling Barrel, and the Diva.
There will also be an Expedition Record Board with rankings for time attack quests. Add on new pop-up camp gear options, new pose sets and gestures, and even some new voice lines for Alma, and there's quite a bit of new stuff to see in Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1.
PC players will be happy to see the improvements laid out prior are being implemented in Title Update 1. VRAM usage is being improved, and the DirectStorage version will be upgraded.
Additionally, numerous bug fixes are taking aim at game crashes, disappearing monsters, and the distance between the monster and the camera for certain monsters like Gore Magala.
There are some balance changes as well, though the extent remains to be seen. The Corrupted Mantle in particular has seen its effects ""adjusted,"" while other Mantle options like Rocksteady, Mending, and Evasion all received buffs.
The Bow is also getting some adjustments, with Dragon Piercer damage decreased but Thousand Dragons damage increased, Power Volley elemental values increased, and both Power Shot and Power Volley now affected by the Charge Master skill.
There arefurther updates detailed in the full patch notes here, running down all the fixes and adjustments arriving with Title Update 1 on April 4, 2025. More is expected to roll out after, with new monsters and events carrying on into the summer and Title Update 2.

"Here are the best deals for Tuesday, March 11. HIghlights include rare discounts on PS5 Dualsense controllers from Lenovo, an Asus Chromebook for just over $100 from Best Buy, the coveted AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D back in stock on Amazon at a non marked-up price, big savings on speedy Samsung SSDs, power banks for your handheld gaming PCs, and more.

Lenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.
Last year the 9th generation iPad was the least expensive iPad you could get brand new and with warranty. It was regularly priced at $179, but it went out of stock pretty much everywhere starting from Black Friday. Fortunately, it's back for one final harrah; right now, Walmart has it available for delivery for only $179 shipped. Seriously though, this deal probably won't last much longer so don't hesitate.
Amazon is offering this Iniu 20,000mAh 65W USB Power Bank for only $21.59 after you clip the 40% off coupon on the product page (if you don't see it, try applying promo code ""WN9GQJRA""). This is a great price for a high-capacity power bank that can deliver more power than other power banks at the same price point. The 65W of power delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, and iPhone 16 at their fastest rates.
4TB for $259.99
Samsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.
If you're in the process of building out a new gaming PC and you're looking for the best gaming processor, this is it. Right now, the recently releasedAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DAM5 desktop processor is back in stock on Amazon and Best Buy at its retail price of $479 shipped. This is the official launch price with zero markup, and it's not bundled with anything you don't want or need. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming processor currently on the market (across both AMD and Intel) and a better choice for gamers than the more expensiveIntel Core Ultra 9 285K.
AMD's new Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards have been released, but just like their Nvidia counterparts, they're mostly out of stock and impossible to find at retail pricing. Don't fret, however, because you can still get these GPUs equipped in a prebuilt gaming PC for a reasonable price. The Radeon RX 9070 GPUs are the new mid-range champions of this generation. Both cards offer phenomenal performance while undercutting their Nvidia competition.
Apple's best earbuds are on sale today. Amazon is offering the second generationApple AirPods Prowireless noise-canceling earbuds for only $169.99 shipped, a savings of 32% and the best AirPods deal so far this year. That's about $20 more than theApple AirPods 4 with ANC, down from its usual $70 price premium. Between the two, the AirPods Pro is stillthe superior earbudsbecause it offers better sound quality and noise cancelation.
Chromebooks aren't exactly gaming-minded PCs, but they're compact, lightweight, great for productivity on the go, and in this case, a bargain. As part of Best Buy's Deal of the Day, you can pick up thisAsus 14"" Chromebookfor just $119 shipped after a $180 off instant discount, although I'd say the MSRP is a tad inflated. Even so, that's still a fantastic deal for a chromebook that features a relatively recent 8-core MediaTek processor which pairs well with Google Chrome OS.
You can grab this 10,000mAh power bank for only $8.99 after you clip the 10% off and 40% off clippable coupons on the product page. We very rarely see 10,000mAh power banks listed for under $10 so grab this one while you can. This will charge a Nintendo Switch from 0% to 100% about 1.9 times.
For a limited time, Hulu is offering four months of Disney+ and Hulu Basic (Ad-Supported) Bundle for just $2.99 per month. The normal cost of this subscription is $10.99 per month. This deal only comes around a handful of times per year and worth it for just the Disney+ subscription alone.
Pick up a five pack of USB Type-C cables for a grand total of just $7.96 after you apply promo code ""UNWEXMFD"". That averages out to about $1.59 per cable. Lengths include two 3.3ft, two 6.6ft, and an extra long 10ft cable. They're all rated for up to 60W of USB Power Delivery and are encased in a durable braided nylon sheath.
If you're searching for your next new game to play,Humble Choice Marchis now live, and this is the perfect bundle to discover something new! This month, Homeworld 3 headlines the bundle, with other PC games like Wild Hearts, Pacific Drive, Zau, and Gravity Circuit also included. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars to grab these games individually, you can get all eight games for just $11.99 at Humble Bundle for this month only.

"Here are the best deals for Wednesday, March 12. Highlights include a rare discount on a (used) PlayStation Portal accessory, Lenovo-exclusive price drops on PS5 DualSense metallic controllers, the first discount we've seen on the iPad Air with M3 chip, USB Type-C cables for only $2.99 apiece, Destiny-themed SteelSeries gaming headsets, and more.

Used: Like New Condition
Looks and functions as if it were new. Moderate packing damage observed during inspection.
ThePlayStation Portalhas never been discounted, but at least you can save on a used one.Amazon Resale(a rebranded Amazon Warehouse) currently has Used: Like New condition PS Portals in stock for only $158.70 shipped. It retails for $199 new, so that's a substantial 20% in savings. A Sony warranty may or may not be included, but Amazon Resale items benefit from the same 30-day return policy you get for buying a new item. We expect this item to sell out pretty quickly.
Lenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.
Amazon is offering a 6-foot INIU USB Type-A to USB Type-C cable for only $2.99 when you apply promo code ""C2ALZ6LN"" during checkout. You can add as many cables as you like and the discount should be applied to each and every cable. These cables are sheathed in nylon braiding for durability and can be used for both data sync and charging (Quick Charge 3.1A compatible). This is a great opportunity to stock up.
If you're thinking of jumping on the AMD bandwagon for your next upgrade, now is certainly the right time to do so. Alongside theRyzen 7 9800X3Dwhich debuted earlier this year, AMD has just released its two higher-end Ryzen 9 siblings in the Zen 5 ""X3D"" stack: the9950X3Dis available for $699 and the9900X3Dis available for $599. Collectively, these processors represent the best gaming chips across both Intel and AMD. Pure gamers should go with the 9800X3D and allocate their funds elsewhere; creators with deeper pockets and a penchant for gaming will benefit from the immense performance uplift on the new Ryzen 9 processors thanks to their increased core count and cache.
Thenew iPad Airsits in the middle of Apple’s tablet lineup, with better specs than the baseline iPad, but it’s not as powerful as the iPad Pro. That said, if you need more computing power in a tablet than what the baseline device above offers, the new iPad Air with M3 chip will likely suit you just fine.
As you can tell by the name, it has Apple’s powerful M3 chip, and it supports Apple Intelligence, unlike the baseline model. It’s also compatible with a new Magic Keyboard (see it at Apple) that has a row of function keys and a trackpad.
As part of its Spring Sale, SteelSeries is taking 40% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets. The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Desinty 2 in-game items.
As part of a generalHP Days Sale Event, you can score an excellent deal on a 4K-capable gaming PC. Right now, theHP Omen 25L GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super Gaming PChas dropped to $1,399.99 shipped after you apply $50 off coupon code ""HPDAYSPC50"". This is quite easily the lowest price we've seen for a prebuilt RTX 4070 Ti Super gaming desktop.
Amazon is offering a four-pack ofApple AirTagskeyfinders for only $64.49. That's over $35 off the retail price and only $16.10 for each AirTag. This is a very practical accessory for anyone who owns an iPhone and tends to lose small wearables like wallets, keys, or remotes.

"inZOIhas sold 1 million copies in a week, developer and publisher Krafton has announced. That’s the fastest sales milestone ever for a game published by the South Korean megacorp.

Krafton’s The Sims competitor launched on PC via Steam in Early Access form on March 28 and quickly hit the headlinesafter players discovered they could run over and kill children. Krafton responded to say it had patched out what it called an ""unintended bug.""
Despite this hiccup, inZOI has a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam, and saw a peak of 175,000 concurrent viewers on Twitch, ranking third in the Games category. It rose to number one on Steam’s Global Top Sellers List (by sales revenue) just 40 minutes after release.
Meanwhile, Canvas, inZOI’s in-game user-generated content (UGC) sharing platform, saw over 1.2 million “participants” on launch day, and over 470,000 pieces of content uploaded.
IGN’sinZOI Early Access reviewreturned a 6/10. We said: “inZOI is a visually striking life simulator with plenty of ambition, but not enough depth as of its Early Access launch.”
Clearly, inZOI is doing the business for Krafton, which highlighted its work promoting the game ahead of launch and its communication with the community as helping to build trust and momentum for release. The inZOI global showcase and demo build “particularly attracted high interest,” Krafton added.
CEO CH Kim commented: “We are grateful and excited to present inZOI to players around the world through Early Access. We will continue to actively communicate with players and foster inZOI as Krafton’s long-term franchise IP.”
As for what’s next, Krafton said future updates will introduce new content, including mod support and new cities, with all updates and DLC provided for free until full release.
In a recent note to players, Krafton said it will “quickly” apply fixes for reported issues through hotfixes during April amid complaints from some players about the state of the game. The scale of inZOI’s global community is “a next-level experience for us,” Krafton said, before admitting it’s “going through some trial and error in finding the optimal means of communication.”

"Lenovo is offering the best deal right now on PlayStation 5 DualSense controllers. The Deep Earth Collection, which includes the metallicVolcanic Red,Cobalt Blue, andSterling Silver. colorways are on sale for $54 after you apply coupon code:PLAY5in your shopping cart. That's about 33% off and better thanAmazon's Spring Sale.

Lenovo might not be the first store you'd think of for great deals on PlayStation controllers, but surprisingly, no one can match their pricing. This might be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, at least untilSony's PlayStation Days of Play Salethat will probably happen sometime in late May.
The original PS5 DualSense controller is decked out in the same white color scheme as the console itself and retails for $69.99. Since then,Sony has consistently released more and more colors, some of them more striking than others. In late 2023, Sony launched theDeep Earth collection, ""a new metallic colorway for PS5 accessories"" with aptly sounding names like Sterling Silver, Volcanic Red, and Cobalt Blue. These controllers retailed for $79.99 and were (and still are) one of the more striking color schemes. We rarely see these on sale compared to the other colors.
Color aside, the Dualsense is oft regarded as thebest PS5 controller under $100. It also makes for an excellent controller for your PC. The DualSense is modeled after the tried and true design and layout of previous PlayStation controllers, but it also packs in modern features such as haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone and speaker, integrated touchpad, internal gyroscope and accelerometer for motion sensing, and USB Type-C charging.

"Amazon is really jacking up the gaming deals in theirSpring Deal Days sale, giving you the limited-time chance to buy a new wirelessXbox controller from just £35.99. While some of the other selections are £4.50 more, the whole selection of colours available for these Series X|S controllers has had a price reduction, so you're getting at least 33% off whichever one you like most.

As a second or spare controller for your Xbox Series X or S console, along with supported games on PC, all those on sale at Amazon right now include the following colours:
Although the standard Carbon Black and Robot White—those bundled with the Xbox Series X & S consoles respectively—have been reduced to the lowest price of £35.99, all of the alternative colors have been dropped to a slightly higher yet still impressive £40.49. If you're in need of a new controller to play the newest games, likeCall of Duty: Black Ops 6which is on sale now as well, this is a fantastic opportunity.
You have to flaunt Amazon a little bit more of your cash to add a splash of style to your setup with one of these vivid color schemes likeAstral Purple, but it does seem worth it. What's more, these other models include the controller's updated design, featuring the X, A, B, and Y buttons being switched from their respective blue, green, red, and yellow colours to match that of their controllers' body.
The original button colours are still shown as tiny dots next to each one, but this update overall gives the controllers a more modest, sleeker appeal that arguably justifies the slightly larger price investment.
For those after a controller with a design that boasts more than one solid colour, Amazon UK also has the Special Fire Vapor Edition of the Xbox Series X|S controller as well,reduced by 20% to £51.99. Featuring titular vapor-like red-and-orange swirls, this bold colour scheme will invoke a little extra energy into your console setup if that's what you're looking for.

"The globe-trotting World of Assassination trilogy of IO Interactive's Hitman series is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 asHitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition. And alongside arriving in the Switch 2 launch window, Agent 47 will also be donning some new, appropriately Nintendo-themed duds.

OnIO Interactive's site, the developer confirmed Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition will go up for pre-order soon, for both digital and physical editions. A pre-order of the digital edition will get you the Signature Pack, which includes two red-and-white outfits for Agent 47, a golden wrench, and a mushroom. Mushroom effects unknown at this time.
Physical pre-orders, meanwhile, offer both the Signature Pack and the Quack Pack, which offers a Luigi-themed green-and-grey suit and a green rubber duck. Much like a bald guy in a red tie and suit at a Paris fashion show, nothing unusual to see here.
Less-than-subtle references aside, it's fun to see Agent 47 get some Nintendo attire. Other games likeBayonettaandThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrimgot their own Nintendo crossover cosmetics, and Agent 47 certainly has earned a bit of Nintendo theming of his own.
The World of Assassination spans a trilogy of games, as Agent 47 undertakes a number of missions to assassinate targets and complete contracts for his clientele. Starting with 2016's Hitman, the WoA trilogy runs up through Hitman III, whichIGN gave a 9, saying: ""Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is one of the barcoded butcher's best appearances.""
Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition combines all of it together into one package. This includes the main campaign, contracts mode, escalations, Elusive Target arcades, and featured live content for Hitman, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3. Also included is the Freelancer game mode, a roguelike option for those who want even more variety and options in their Hitman experience.
Currently, Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition is due to arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in June 2025. Its also available now on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, the original Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation PS VR2.

"Samsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.

4TB for $259.99
The Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.
The Samsung 990 Evo Plus does not have a preinstalled heatsink. However, the 990 Evo Plus SSD is a newer single-sided SSD design that is power efficient and doesn't generate as much heat as SSDs from before. That means you probably don't need to use a heatsink and it should still work perfectly fine in a PS5 console without any thermal throttling. That said, you certainly could for peace of mind and I wouldn't see any disadvantage to that aside fromspending an extra $7.

"TheLG UltraGear 27GX790A-B gaming monitorwas released at the tail end of 2024. This was LG's first ever OLED monitor with an incredible 480Hz refresh rate. It launched at a starting price of $999.99, which hadn't been discounted at all - until now. For a few days only, the LG online store is offering a 25% off coupon code ""SAVE25"" that drops the price by to $749.99 shipped. This is one of thebest 27"" QHD gaming monitorsyou can get right now, especially if you're aiming for the highest frame rates possible in your FPS games.

The LG UltraGear GX790 is a 27"" monitor with a 2560x1440 resolution (109ppi), 480Hz refresh rate, and G-Sync compatibility. This monitor uses LG's latest generation WOLED panel, which offers near instantaneous response times (0.03ms) and true black levels that can't be matched by any other panel type, including Mini-LED. The GX790 also boasts a 98.5% DCI-P3 color range, HDR True Black 400 certification, and is factory calibrated. Connectivity wise, the GX790 includes one DisplayPort 2.1 port (which you will need to use to get 480Hz), two HDMI 1.4 ports, and two USB 3.0 ports.
Because the GX790 combines an OLED panel with a super high refresh rate, it excels at games with a lot of fast or twitchy motion like shooters. To achieve framerates of up to 480fps at 2560x1440, you'll need to make sure your PC is equipped with the appropriate video card. Depending on the game, you'll probably need at least a graphics card like theGeForce RTX 4070. Games likeCounter-StrikeorFortnitehave less demanding needs thanCall of Duty: Black Ops 6.

"TheNintendo Switch 2has finally been revealed, and while it brings huge improvements over the original console, it doesn’t exist in the same vacuum that the original handheld did. With the introduction of devices like theSteam DeckandAsus ROG Ally X, a ton of handheld gaming systems out there can play AAA PC games on the go.

So, while the Switch 2 will automatically have a niche carved out for being a system that plays, well, Nintendo games likeMario Kart World,anyone that’s buying a Switch 2 to play multiplatform games will have to reckon with devices like the Steam Deck – especially with the Switch 2’s $449 price tag.
Now that Nintendo has given a sneak peek into the hardware that’s running its new console, we can take a look at how exactly it will run, and whether or not its 4K promises are more than empty words.
The SoC (System on a Chip) that runs the Nintendo Switch 2 is probably the most important part of the console, but it’s the thing we know the least about. We do know that it’s a “custom Nvidia processor” thatsupports DLSS and ray tracing, but beyond that, neither Nintendo nor Nvidia have revealed any specifics. Luckily, there are a ton of leaks that suggest the Nintendo Switch 2 is using the aging Ampere graphics architecture behind theRTX 3080.
Going all the way back to 2023, there wereleaks suggesting that the Nintendo Switch 2 would be using the Nvidia Tegra T239 SoC. This APU uses 8 ARM A78C cores, combined with an Nvidia Ampere GPU with 1,536 CUDA cores. Napkin math puts that at 12 Streaming Multiprocessors, which would be significantly smaller than even the smallest Ampere GPU – the RTX 3050 for laptops. However, assuming Nvidia didn’t nerf the Ampere SMs in the T239, each SM would have four Tensor Cores and an RT core, making for a total of 48 and 12, respectively.
To be fair, the Steam Deck is using a custom AMD APU that’s built on 8 AMD RDNA 2 GPU cores, which is smaller than what Nintendo is offering here. But, you have to keep in mind that the Steam Deck has a lower resolution display, and pumps more power into it. Plus,AMD Z2 processorsare coming out over the next year, with the Z2 Extreme featuring 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, which will be a huge upgrade. Though, systems with that chipset are going to bemuchmore expensive than the Switch 2.
That small of a GPU basically makes 4K gaming an impossibility natively, but because the Tensor Cores are there, DLSS is going to be a major factor in how the Nintendo Switch performs when docked – assuming this is the SoC that’s actually in the system. However, with so few Tensor Cores, even upscaling to 4K is going to be a stretch in everything but the most lightweight games.
Instead, most games are likely going to target 1080p, even if they don’t natively render at that resolution. There are games like Donkey Kong Bananza that do seem to be rendering at a native 1080p resolution, according toDigital Foundry’s hands-on demos. However, third-party games like Cyberpunk 2077 seem to be relying heavily on upscaling, with native resolutions as low as 540p. I wouldn’t expect the Nintendo Switch 2 to ever be able to handle Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K, even with DLSS, though Nintendo will definitely have better luck with any game it can get running natively at 1080p.
The Ampere cores in the rumored T239 also have RT cores, which should theoretically allow for ray tracing in Nintendo Switch 2 games. Though, again, this will be heavily constrained by the processor’s 12 RT cores. Ray tracing will be possible, but don’t expect any jaw-dropping implementations of the technology, and especially don’t expect it in games likeCyberpunk 2077.
Even with RT cores, ray tracing is an extremely expensive workload for the GPU, and the T239 is limited by more than just its small SM count – power is a huge limiting factor, too. I spoke withRichard Leadbetter over at Digital Foundry, who told me that the entire system likely consumes as little as 10W, including the display, the SoC, and the mainboard. We won’t know exactly what the T239’s actual TDP (thermal design power) is until someone finds a way to measure it, but it likely leaves only 5-6W for the SoC itself – a third of the power of the Steam Deck’s AMD APU.
However, while the Nintendo Switch 2 might not be able to produce the same amount of power as ahandheld gaming PClike the Asus ROG Ally X, that doesn’t mean there won’t be gorgeous games running on the system. After all, games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza look stunning, and it goes to show how clever Nintendo developers are at getting the most out of the hardware in the Switch.
After all, the original Nintendo Switch was powered by the Nvidia Tegra X1, which was built on thenow-ancient Maxwell graphics architectureand only packed 256 CUDA cores. Ampere is orders of magnitude more efficient than Maxwell even on its best days, and there are six times more cores in the Switch 2’s GPU. The Nintendo Switch 2 should bewayfaster than the original console, which bodes well for cross-generation ports like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
While a total system power budget of 10W means the system isn’t quite as fast as it could be, it does mean the battery will have a much better time keeping up. Nintendo has come out and said it should last around 2 hours at a minimum. That’s less than was quoted for the original Switch, but that shouldn’t be too surprising, due to its higher-resolution display and more powerful processor.
The Nintendo Switch 2 has a 5,220mAh battery, a large step up from the 4,310mAh battery in the original console. That’s a sizable jump, and if its battery has the same voltage of the original Switch, that would equate to around 19Whr. That’s a smaller battery than theSteam Deck, which is probably why Nintendo quotes a similar battery life to the Steam Deck, despite its less power-hungry processor.
Nintendo probably could have put a more powerful battery in the Switch 2, but its decision likely came down to size constraints. There’s only so much battery that’ll fit while retaining the same thickness as the original Nintendo Switch, after all.
The most striking difference at first glancebetween the Switch and Switch 2is probably going to be the display. While it doesn’t have the OLED screen that made theSwitch OLEDsuch a marvel, the display is bigger and has a higher resolution. The Nintendo Switch 2 sports a 7.9-inch LCD display with a resolution of 1920x1080 with HDR 10 support. The display is also fast, supporting variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. That’s honestly a bit overkill considering the silicon powering the thing, but it does mean that older games or indie titles will feel extremely smooth – assuming they have unlocked frame rates. 120Hz is also a useful refresh rate for games that target 40fps since that makes for a clean ratio that won’t result in excessive stuttering.
Nintendo hasn’t released any information about the brightness of the display, but the HDR 10 certification means it needs toat leasthave a peak brightness of 1,000 nits, so it’s going to be a bright screen. We don’t know exactly how color performance will turn out either, but Nintendo does claim that it supports WCG, or Wide Color Gamut.
The display is probably going to be the thing that lifts the Nintendo Switch 2 above its competitors. The Steam Deck LCD has an 800p display with a peak brightness of 400 nits, and it doesn’t support WCG. The Steam Deck OLED does offer a much nicer display, but it’s still an 800p display. The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is also a huge upgrade over the original, which had a 6.2-inch, 720p LCD display.
In a vacuum, the Nintendo Switch 2 is massively better than the original Nintendo Switch. It’s leagues faster, has a screen that’s bigger, brighter and sharper, and has Joy-Con that you don’t have to wrestle with to disconnect. The only problem is that the Switch doesn’t exist in a vacuum anymore.
There are a ton of handheld gaming systems out there now, and while most of them are more expensive than the $449 Nintendo Switch 2, they likely offer a better gameplay experience in multi-platform games. The real appeal of the Switch 2 is going to be Nintendo’s catalog of first-party games, just like with the original console. Nintendo is known for making great games that make the most of its – relatively – weak hardware. If you’re the type of gamer that falls in love with Nintendo games, then the Nintendo Switch 2 makes a lot of sense. However, if you’re just going to get this thing to play Cyberpunk or Elden Ring on the train, there arebetter gaming handheld optionsout there.

"If you didn’t already know it, Honor of Kings is one of the most played games in the world. Taking the number one spot in the Chinese MOBA charts, the TiMi Group is taking its free-to-play characters – and world – in a new direction with Honor of Kings: World. While its scale and monetization screech in dissonance, its flashy combat, diverse roster of playable classes, and multiplayer-flexible modes do carry some promise.

During my half-hour-long hands-on with Honor of Kings: World at Tencent’s GDC booth, I took some time to toy around with a couple of World’s different classes, take on a boss inspired by Chinese folklore, and see a brief glimpse of the story.
Although it boasts many of the same characters as its mobile MOBA predecessor, Honor of Kings: World is no MOBA. Instead, it’s a class-driven action game – for PC as well as mobile, by the way – with the kind of over-the-shoulder, action-driven combat you might expect from something like Genshin Impact. But rather than locking mechanics or gameplay behind randomized drops like in MiHoYo’s game, Honor of Kings offers players different classes to choose from. And while the same overall control scheme unifies each class – a dodge, three standard abilities, and an ultimate of sorts – the roster of different classes struck me as fairly diverse, each with its own abilities and special perks.
Usually, you’ll be able to play with two separate classes, though sometimes you might need to stick with just one for story purposes. It seems like TiMi’s put a lot of effort into the dual-class system, allowing you to switch between the two during combat. The most interesting example they showed during my demo was starting a long, multiple-attack combo and switching characters once the target was launched into the air to extend a combo. It kind of reminded me of a tag system in a fighting game.
With 11 different classes in the demo I played, I’m certain there are tons of different combinations and ways to style on your opponent. But since this was my first time playing, I looked for balance above all else: I stuck with an even-keeled loadout, using a sword-wielding class for my primary role and a ranged gunner for the second. The two nicely filled in gaps left by the other during my attempt at a boss fight: I’d lay down fire using the gunner’s active reload mechanic to improve my damage and rate of fire when the boss was spitting out attacks in a frenzy, making sure to dodge the occasional flaming projectile and then rush him down with my sword, laying on the damage with a vengeance.
This swapping was easily my favorite part of the demo. I enjoyed hammering away at the boss’s stance meter, breaking his stance, and shooting the gunner’s R ability as I closed the distance, swapping to my sword class, and unleashing a devastating ultimate attack of sorts to juice every second from the boss’ temporarily weakened state.
Taking the boss down to a certain point also revealed an interesting story beat that eventually led to me playing as a completely separate character from the pre-built avatar provided for the demo. TiMi didn’t offer much information on how frequently to expect this kind of change, only that it would happen from time to time. The demo took place somewhere closer to halfway through Honor of Kings: World’s runtime, opening up my two classes’ skill trees just enough for me to have some fun with them without overcomplicating its combat.
The boss itself was a giant monkey character with various different masks, with a personality and attacking style for each. According to the developer leading my demo, this mechanic has its roots in a traditional style of Chinese theater calledBian lian. One mask might see him spitting fire in a massive area of effect on the map, while another might see him throw around a few melee attacks. I loved this melding of culture, history, and story with a gameplay mechanic.
Aside from briefly seeing another journalist in my demo in a hub area before the tutorial, I didn’t have a chance to check out any of World’s multiplayer offerings. TiMi showed a few clips of four-person squads crawling dungeons and taking on bosses before our demo, but teased something that sounded more like an MMO. That part is still a work in progress, so they didn’t share much beyond acknowledging that there would be a bigger scale multiplayer mode in the full game, so I’m curious to see what that looks like given my demo’s single-player scope.
Before the demo, one of TiMi’s developers walked me through some of World’s premise and setup, saying that Honor of Kings: World was a gift of sorts to the MOBA’s loyal fanbase that’s propelled it to massive success in the ten years since its launch. True as that may be, I left the demo concerned about monetization.
When another journalist asked about how TiMi plans to make money with Honor of Kings: World, the developer leading our session gave a concerning answer. “The game’s gonna be based around social, so outfits and stuff,” they said.
On its own, funding a free-to-play game with cosmetics isn’t necessarily a problem – especially since the developers made it clear that there wouldn’t be any pay-to-win – but given Honor of Kings: World’s scale, with flashy cutscenes, tons of playable characters, and epic boss fights, I can’t help but feel concerned about whether or not World’s model is financially sustainable, regardless of whether or not it’s based on one of the most successful games of the century.
Honor of Kings: World undoubtedly has a bright future ahead of it, provided TiMi can stick to its promise of giving fans of its MOBA hit a celebration worthy of its success. Even though I’m still a little worried about the amount of microtransactions that Honor of Kings: World could potentially need to fund its high production value, I still had a ton of fun dodging the big primate’s swings."
"When I was in high school, I would stay up ‘til all kinds of ungodly hours of the night playing PC games. I even stayed up five days straight once, just to get to the end of Baldur’s Gate II ‘Throne of Bhaal,’ but what fascinated me about PC games most was how inventive they could be.

One that struck my imagination powerfully was Red Faction, which caught my eye because it had some of the hallmarks of DOOM (a high-tech, first-person shooter set on Mars, you say?) yet it added an essential wrinkle; terrain deformation. Red Faction is set in the mines of Mars, and I could fire explosive weapons at walls, creating holes or destroying them, and even tunneling through rock to circumvent checkpoints. It was all about charting your own course and finding your own path to accomplish your goals. It was incredible.
Unfortunately, not a lot has been done with that idea in the intervening years, but when Rainbow Six Siege came out, the ability to freely climb and rappel up and down buildings, and shoot through or destroy walls and ceilings sent a delightful little tickle through my Red Faction-loving brain.
While Siege began as a far more focused (and less exploratory) affair than the old Volition shooter, that (and quite a bit more) is about to change with the arrival of the upcoming Siege X update. Apart from gameplay, graphical, auditory, and UI enhancements, it introduces what is shaping up to be a fantastic new permanent multiplayer mode: Dual Front.
In Dual Front, a predetermined seasonal Operator pool will dictate who you can play, and team sizes are bumped up to six per side. Instead of spawning directly inside (or outside) one target area, there are three large areas to choose from, each with its own objective, so your team of six will need to split up to focus on both defending and attacking different locations simultaneously.
While the scope has expanded, much of the great core gameplay remains the same. When a match starts, each team will spawn in their squad HQ and one of two locations in your team’s sector will start a countdown to a Defend mission. The     is true for your opponents, so each team will need to defend one spot while attacking another. How you handle that, and where you decide to go, is up to you.
What’s more, there is a neutral zone in between the mirrored zones held by each team, and extra objectives will appear there. Completing those objectives, such as rescuing a hostage and getting them to an extraction point, will give your team a big boost in the back-and-forth struggle for supremacy, so even if you fail to defend your first location or attack the enemy base, victory is still possible.
Since Dual Front expands the contested space so significantly, I was moving between attacking and defending to suit the team's needs, creating a more free flowing experience with way more variation between matches than your standard Siege match. What results is a fluid, chaotic mess I had a blast with.
The seasonal Operator pools will be updated every month, and because your squad will need to do a little bit of everything, you’ll have access to both Attacker and Defender Operators on the character select screen. When you die during a match, you’ll quickly respawn and re-select your Operator, so changing strategies on the fly to counter your enemies is a central (and delightfully fun) part of the game now.
Several times during my preview, it looked like my current (attacking) team was in a great spot, so I would rush across the map to help my other beleaguered comrades who were fighting for their lives to defend our own base objective. Sometimes, everything was as it seemed: I arrived in time, and our team brought home a victory. Other times, I got separated from my team only for them to be ambushed by reinforcements. Each match was tense, because in maps as large as Dual Front’s, it’s difficult to know where the enemy is until they become a capital “p” Problem.
Speaking of navigating larger areas, I should mention some of the new gameplay additions. You can now rappel around corners of buildings and even sprint while rappelling, so it’s easier to poke around and find ways to get inside structures. New fire extinguishers create concussive blasts and visual obfuscation when destroyed, gas pipes can be shot or damaged to create jets of fire before exploding and scattering fire around on the ground, and metal detectors can be disabled temporarily or permanently. Overall, it’s more fun to play in the space, and there is a lot more space to play in on Dual Front’s mirrored map.
Siege X also marks a shift in monetization. After the update, Siege will adopt a free-to-play model, and for casual versus competitive stuff, here’s the skinny: casual and onboarding playlists, unranked quickplay, and Dual Front are all free, and will grant access to up to 26 Operators and skins. Siege Cup and Ranked modes will be pay-to-unlock, and grant access to all 50 Operators. So if you are jumping in as a casual player, there are no barriers to entry, but new players who want to get more serious on the competitive side will need to fork over some cash. If you already have Siege, don’t worry; you will keep everything you have, and retain access to all modes (and as an added bonus, Siege players will get a badge showing off the year they started and a little bonus for each year of Siege they played).
Some other updates in the Siege X package include five modernized maps (Clubhouse, Chalet, Bank, Kafe, and Border), enhanced visuals, audio, first-person shadows, new menus, better player onboarding, the ability to inspect weapons, and a lot more. The dev team has also committed to introduce a new Operator (or remastering an existing one) each season, and a bunch more.
But all those enhancements pale in comparison to Dual Front, which is on track to become my favorite mode for Siege, and once Siege X launches, it’s likely to be the only mode I’ll play as Siege marks its upcoming tenth birthday in an incredibly fun way."
"While theNvidia GeForce RTX 5090sits comfortably at the top of the graphics card market, not many people realistically have the cash to throw at its $1,999+ price tag. Luckily, you don’t have to lose out on 4K gaming just because you can’t afford the absolutebest graphics card. Both theNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Tiand theAMD Radeon RX 9070 XTare much more affordable and deliver an extremely solid 4K gaming experience.

While prices right now are unfortunately elevated – due in large part to the heightened demand and low supply any GPU faces right after launch – the RTX 5070 Ti and RX 9070 XT are the graphics cards most people should be looking at for a high-end gaming experience.
Comparing two graphics cards that use entirely different graphics architectures on specs is incredibly complicated. While Nvidia’s CUDA cores and AMD’s Shading Units serve a similar purpose, they’re different enough that a direct comparison from a purely quantity perspective is essentially pointless.
The AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT consists of 64 RDNA 4 compute units, each with 64 shader units, making for a total of 4,096. Each of those compute units also has two AI Accelerators and one RT Accelerator, making for 128 and 64, respectively. AMD pairs these compute units with 16GB of GDDR6 memory on a 256-bit bus, which should be more than enough for modern games, though it could be stretched in the future, especially at 4K.
The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti also has 16GB of VRAM, but instead of opting for GDDR6, Team Green went with the new GDDR7, which is theoretically much faster. That’s also on a 256-bit bus, but because of higher memory speeds, it has higher bandwidth. The RTX 5070 Ti is built with 70 Streaming Multiprocessors – Nvidia’s name for Compute Units, with a total of 8,960 CUDA Cores, or Shading Units. That’s twice as many Shader Units per Compute Unit, something Nvidia has been pulling off since the RTX 3080 back in 2020. However, that doesn’t directly lead to double the performance.
Winner:Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti
While on paper the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti looks far superior to the Radeon RX 9070 XT, the performance doesn’t quite work out that way. Instead, both graphics cards are excellent entry-level cards for anyone who wants to play at 4K, and are among the best graphics cards on the market for 1440p gaming.
When I reviewed theAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT, I expected it to be within reaching distance of the RTX 5070 Ti, falling further behind in games with a lot of ray tracing. However, I found that even in games like Cyberpunk 2077, the AMD graphics card had no problem staying within a few frames of the much more expensive RTX 5070 Ti.
There are certainly games where the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti pulls ahead. For example, in Total War: Warhammer 3, the RTX 5070 Ti gets 87fps at 4K, compared to the 9070 XT’s 76fps. But even with Nvidia’s occasional wins, I found that the Radeon RX 9070 XT was on average 2% faster than the 5070 Ti. That’s a minor difference, but even 2% is a huge win for a card that theoretically costs 21% less.
Winner:AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT
These days, picking the right graphics card is more than just looking at what the hardware can do. Both Nvidia and AMD offer an entire suite of software features that further stretch what the graphics card can do.
The big selling point for the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti, and really allNvidia graphics cards, is the suite of features that now falls under the DLSS umbrella. This includes things like AI upscaling and Frame Generation, but forDLSS 4, Team Green found a way to expand the latter. Now, with RTX 5000 graphics cards, Nvidia has enabled multi-frame generation, which can use AI to generate three frames for each naturally rendered frame. This greatly improves frame rates, but it does come with a small latency cost – though that’s largely offset by Nvidia Reflex. Just like DLSS 3’s Frame Generation, you’re only going to want to enable this feature if you’re already getting a decent frame rate – at least 45, but ideally more than 60fps.
AMD also supports Frame Generation, but Team Red GPUs can still only generate one interpolated frame per rendered frame. Instead, the big improvement this time around is FSR 4, which brings AI upscaling to AMD graphics cards for the first time. Before this generation, FSR was based on a temporal upscaling method, which delivers excellent performance but could result in fuzzy images. FSR 4 uses the Radeon RX 9070 XT AI accelerators to upscale the image using a machine learning algorithm, much like how DLSS has worked since 2018. This upscaling method is much more accurate, even though it’s not quite as fast as FSR 4.
It’s also important to keep in mind that this is only the first generation of AMD’s AI upscaler, and Nvidia has been training DLSS for seven years now.
Winner:Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti
GPU pricing is a hot-button issue right now as pretty much every graphics card of this new generation is completely sold out, with many seeing incredibly inflated prices. The problem is that both Nvidia and AMD set a ‘""suggested"" retail price for these graphics cards, but then retailers and third-party manufacturers are essentially free to price them however they want to. I can’t predict what GPU prices will look like in six months, but hopefully the prices start falling closer to MSRP once supply catches up with the demand.
At its launch price, the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is an absolute triumph. At $599, the 9070 XT is an incredible little 4K graphics card, easily capable of running any game on the market with everything maxed out, provided you use the new FSR 4 AI upscaler. This is the price point flagship graphics cardsusedto launch at before Nvidia started gradually escalating prices, starting with the RTX 2080 Ti. Hopefully this means GPU manufacturers will start returning prices to sanity, but that depends on if prices normalize again.
Nvidia took a different approach with the 5070 Ti, though. While it trades blows with the 9070 XT, it has a base price of $749, a huge $150 price lift. That’s a massive difference between two graphics cards that performextremely similarly.There are a few features that you get by going with a GPU from Team Green, like Multi-Frame Generation, but whether that’s worth it is largely going to depend on what you’re looking for and the games you actually play.
Winner:AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT
While both the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti are excellent 1440p graphics cards, it’s impossible to escape the fact that AMD is able to trade blows with Team Green’s card at a much lower price. Assuming prices return to normality, the gap between the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and the 5070 Ti makes AMD’s card a clear winner.
If you’re looking to build a gaming PC for high-end 1440p gaming, or even want to stretch into 4K, it’s hard to think of a better graphics card to buy right now. Because, sure, the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT doesn’t have multi-frame generation, but most people don’t have the high-refresh 4K gaming monitors that would actually benefit from it.

"Ludwig is now streaming on Britbox.

Actors playing doubles (and even multiples) of themselves onscreen is back in a big way. Robert Pattinson inMickey 17. Robert De Niro inThe Alto Knights. Michael B. Jordan inSinners. Practically everyone onSeverance. Add to this esteemed company English comedian David Mitchell, who appears as identical twins in the delightful mystery comedy Ludwig. Fans of British police procedurals and comedy panel shows rejoice: The Peep Show star and Big Fat Quiz fixture playing a missing detectiveandthe misanthropic puzzle designer impersonating his brother to find out where he went is exactly as fun as it sounds.
Most of Ludwig rides on the curmudgeonly charisma of Mitchell’s public persona. (It’s not for nothing that he played the stodgy PC inthe UK version of Apple’s “Get a Mac” commercials.) Main character John Taylor (“Ludwig” is the name he self-publishes puzzle books under) is a harrumphing eccentric, bewildered by small talk and apt to go on long tirades berating people for improper joke structure. He putters around crime scenes in a tweed jacket with a pocket full of pens, notebook at the ready. Fortunately, his love of puzzles makes him an unusually astute solver of murders – helpful when you’re trying to convince other people you’re actually detective chief inspector James Taylor of the Cambridge police.
Ludwig’s puzzles themselves are a delight, though you don’t have to understand them in order to enjoy the show. (Source: yours truly, who is terrible at puzzles.) The episodes are structured as if by a Cryptoquip enthusiast Agatha Christie: an impossible crime, a group of suspects, a few red herrings (“false paths” in puzzler lingo), and a monologue at the end where the perpetrator is unmasked. Each one involves some sort of common puzzle type – a code, a logic grid, a hidden acrostic – that eventually leads John towards the correct conclusion. His fellow officers are baffled by his unorthodox methods, but the results speak for themselves.
Ludwig isn’t too concerned with breaking any new ground in the comedy procedural genre, sticking to a conventional case-of-the-week structure and keeping things light. (As light as a show involving homicide investigations and a man, his sister-in-law, and his nephew searching for a missing family member can be.) It’s in the details where the show finds its charms: John, a nerdy loner all his life, finds enjoyment in playacting the role of husband and father to James’ wife, Lucy (Anna Maxwell Martin), and son, Henry (Dylan Hughes). In turn, Lucy and Henry immediately and enthusiastically take to the scavenger hunt for clues to James’ whereabouts, implying he’s a more absent figure in their lives than they’d let on.
The well-rounded main cast makes for an unlikely family unit but a great trio of leads, growing closer as the show progresses towards its dramatic finale. It’s just one of the ways Ludwig looks askance at the vast sea of British crime shows, finding new routes into familiar formulas as only a master puzzle-solver could. The guy who calls himself Ludwig may have an exact genetic match out there, but Ludwig the show is a comedy without equal.
Ludwig stars British comedian David Mitchell as a curmudgeonly puzzle setter impersonating his detective twin brother who finds out his puzzle skills make him unusually good at solving murders, and is exactly as fun as that premise would suggest. With a capable cast of supporting characters and a delightfully idiosyncratic trio of leads, the show turns the formulaic British crime procedural on its head in increasingly delightful ways."
"Bethesda has announced that MachineGames’Indiana Jones and The Great Circlelaunches on PlayStation 5 on April 15 for early access ahead of a global release on April 17. Those whopre-ordergetaccess to the early access.

The PS5 release date, which comes four months after Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launched on Xbox and PC, was announced alongside a playful promo trailer that sees perhaps the two most famous video game actors in the world on-screen together.
In the trailer, Indiana Jones actor Troy Baker sits down for a chat with Uncharted star Nolan North, who famously plays intrepid explorer Nathan Drake in the PlayStation-exclusive series. Drake and the Uncharted series are of course heavily inspired by Indiana Jones, so this meeting of the actors who play the characters is a full circle moment for The Great Circle itself.
There’s an added layer here, which is the Microsoft-owned Bethesda has drafted in Nolan North, the actor behind the Sony-owned franchise Uncharted, for a chinwag in one of its adverts. Now, at no point does North say ‘Nathan Drake’ or ‘Uncharted’ or anything that might legally belong to Sony Computer Entertainment, but his delivery in the video is knowing indeed.
Drake — I mean North — playfully suggests he broke into the lavishly decorated room in which he’s sat and so doesn’t have much time to talk. The suggestion here is goons might burst through the door at any moment, as they tend to do when Nate is rummaging through drawers on the hunt for clues.
North asks Baker how he’s going to deal with Private Military Forces with just a whip. Baker points to his head, saying, “use the old—” “headbutt,” North interjects. “I like it. Aggressive.” North says he’s “more of a sidearms kinda guy… jeans… henley,” and, as Baker quips, “somehow always half-tucked.”
Both North and Baker then bond over a shared enthusiasm for ancient artefacts, although North wants to sell them to the highest bidder, while Baker wants to donate them to a museum. This is Nathan Drake accepting the new Indiana Jones into a “very exclusive club” of adventurers. “Welcome to the club,” North declares. Xbox’s Indiana Jones now sits proudly alongside PlayStation’s Uncharted on Sony’s console, treasure-hunters in crime. All that’s left is for Lara Croft to break through the window and say something about not wanting the boys to have all the fun.
This is all part of Microsoft’s now-established multiplatform push, which has already seen a number of Xbox games launch on rival consoles. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is just the latest to make the jump, with Playground’s Forza Horizon 5, Id Software’s Doom: The Dark Ages and, reportedly, many more Microsoft-made games not far behind.
Boosted by launching day one on Game Pass, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has so farreached 4 million players— a figure that will no doubt see a significant boost once the PS5 version goes live.
Indiana Jones actor Harrison Ford has saidTroy Baker playing the beloved character in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is proof ""you don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul.""
Ford discussed alleviating control of Indy withThe Wall Street Journal, saying he was very happy with the performance of The Last of Us actor Baker.
""You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul,"" Ford said. ""You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent. He did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.""

"If you're in the process of building out a new gaming PC and you're looking for the best gaming processor, this is it. Right now, the recently releasedAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DAM5 desktop processor is back in stock on Amazon and Best Buy at its retail price of $479 shipped. This is the official launch price with zero markup, and it's not bundled with anything you don't want or need. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming processor currently on the market (across both AMD and Intel) and a better choice for gamers than the more expensiveIntel Core Ultra 9 285K.

AMD's X3D series processors are optimized for gaming. In that respect, they bench better than even the most expensive of AMD's standard lineup of CPUs thanks to AMD's 3D V-Cache technology. Although perfectly capable of handling multitasking, rendering, and creation, the limited number of cores means they aren't the ideal processors for those tasks. At its retail price of $479, the 9800X3D is $110 cheaper than theIntel Core Ultra 9 285K($589) and $170 cheaper than theAMD Ryzen 9 9950X, even though it outperforms both of them in gaming. Unless you're a staunch Intel fan, or you're still on AM4 and don't want to upgrade all of your components, the 9800X3D is the obvious choice for your next gaming rig.
""The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is extremely powerful in games, which makes it easier to recommend than other recent processors like the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K or Ryzen 9 9900X.

"A Black Friday deal on one of the best OLED TVs is back. Starting today,AmazonandSamsungare offering the 2024 65"" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV for only $1,399.99 shipped after $1,300 in instant savings. This is anexcellent TV to pair up with your PlayStation 5or Xbox Series X. This TV is considered to as good as or better than the popular LG C4 OLED TV. According toRTINGS, the Samsung S90D is a brighter TV with a wider color gamut, better color volume, wider viewing angle, and better HDR gradient handling.

The Samsung S90D is the current generation 2024 model. A new ""S90F"" model was announced during CES 2025, but it has yet to be released. This TV is equipped with Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times.
OLED technology aside, the Samsung S90D also has all the features you'd want in agaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming console. The S90D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to the recently releasedPlaystation 5 Proconsole since it can drive more games in quality mode (native 4K @ 120fps) than the standard PS5, which often needs to be set to performance mode (upscaled 4K).
If you're looking for a smaller size, the 42"", 48"", and 55"" models are also on sale. The 42"" model is ideal for PC monitor use. At that screen size, the 4K resolution equates to a respectable 104ppi pixel density and supports chroma 4:4:4 subsampling for clear, legible text. The HDMI 2.1 input supports refresh rates of up to 144Hz over 4K resolution.
For this week only, Best Buy is offering the 77"" Samsung S84D 4K OLED smart TV for $1,499.99. That's only $150 more than the 65"" S90D model for a 40% larger screen size. The S84D is Best Buy's exclusive model that's identical to the S85D but with slightly better speakers (30W vs 20W). Compared to the S90D, the S84D is a step down in image quality since it doesn't utilize quantum dot technology and the refresh rate is limited to 120Hz instead of 144Hz. However, it's still an outstanding TV compared to other TVs on the market and an excellent value at this price.

"New details about what's in store for the horrors waiting withinSilent Hill fhave emerged, and they make it clear that developer NeoBards Entertainment is keeping in step with the series' tone.

Warning!The following descriptions contain some gruesome details about the content of Silent Hill f, which will entail possible spoilers and mature content.
Konami airedits latest Silent Hill Transmission broadcast just last week, sharing more details about the upcoming Silent Hill f. Developed by NeoBards, set in a mountain town in 1960s Japan, and written by Higurashi and Umineko author Ryukishi07, Silent Hill f looks to be an interesting new venture for the horror series.
The broadcast didn't include much in the way of gameplay though. In lieu of that, fans have been poring over the content warnings and ESRB rating for Silent Hill f, both of which are live and provide some surprisingly detailed descriptions of what terrors wait in the town of Ebisugaoka.
Over on the ESRB site, Silent Hill f garnered a Mature 17+ rating for ""Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Partial Nudity."" None of that by itself is terribly surprising, but it's the rating summary that offers some more detail:
Faces ripped apart, hot irons, and a character sawing off their arm certainly paint a gruesome picture. Silent Hill f could get pretty gnarly, even by Silent Hill's standards. It is, after all,the first game in the series to earn a CERO:Z in Japan, an 18+ rating; the others have typically garnered CERO:C or CERO:D, which are 15+ and 17+, respectively.
Silent Hill f may also be dealing with some heavy topics and imagery too. For that, we can look at the game's content warning, displayed on boththe official siteand theSteam store page:
Between the actual physical horror and tackling these kinds of themes, Silent Hill f certainly seems like it's engaging with the kind of material you'd expect in a Silent Hill. For horror fans, that's hopefully a good sign.
Silent Hill f has no release date at the moment, though having an ESRB rating this detailed certainly suggests it's not far off. It's currently targeting PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC when it does launch.

"Activision, Treyarch, and Raven Software have detailed a special Return to Verdansk event and free trial period that will coincide with the launch of the originalCall of Duty: Warzonemap next week.

The team behind the current iteration of the massively popular military shooter battle royale experience shared everything players could ever want to know about Verdansk’s revival today. Included with a breakdown of all new and returning features, locations, modes, and more was a schedule for the Return to Verdansk event, which includes an ammo crate filled with rewards to earn from launch on April 3 to April 15.
Activision is calling its limited-time event a “celebration” of the return to the open-world map that started it all. It includes 12 unique zones to explore in Battle Royale and Plunder modes, each with safes to crack and exclusive rewards to obtain. Most goodies come in the form of loading screens, sprays, emotes, finishing moves, etc., but there is a rare chance that your hidden safe will grant access to an Operator skin completely unique to the Return to Verdansk event. Acquiring all 12 rewards also gifts players the freedom to use one of Modern Warfare 2019’s most infamous melee tools: the Kali Sticks.
Thankfully, if you’re the kind of player who can’t sink in the time to loot all 12 safes and try for that rare skin, you’ll be happy to know all players earn six free rewards simply for logging in. They are as follows: Kilo 141 (primary weapon), Domino (Warzone Operator), Mil-Sim USEF (Warzone Operator), Blue Legacy (Contrail for Verdansk Veterans), Coming Home (Parachute for Verdansk veterans), Like We Never Left (Gunscreen for Verdansk veterans).
Call of Duty: Warzone’s return to Verdansk is more than just a simple retread. The OG map’s reintroduction marks a significant moment for longtime fans and Activision, so it makes sense that the publisher wants to see as many players get in on the fun as possible.
As Warzone launches into its most significant seasonal update in years, players will be allowed to access all Premium Black Ops 6 content for 24 hours starting on April 2 at 9:00 a.m. PT. That means unlimited access to Zombies and Multiplayer modes and a whole day to unlock a treasure trove of rewards that can be carried over to Warzone. It’s an access period that launches alongside Season 3 that same day, meaning all trial players can enjoy the full experience of the update at no extra cost.
The trade here is that Warzone will be down from April 2 – 3 as the team welcomes Verdansk in and sees Urzikstan out. Once the downtime ends, though, it’s back to Atlas Superstore, Stadium, Gora Dam, and more on console and PC for the first time since 2021. For more on all things Call of Duty, you can read up onhow Activision is battling cheatersto help prepare for Verdansk’s return to Warzone.

"A video purportedly taken from the next iteration of The Sims has popped up online, and fans have expressed their concern about what it may mean for the much-loved series.

Project Rene- the codename sometimes used interchangeably with The Sims 5, although EA maintains Project Rene is, in fact, a spin-off project - has been bubbling around for a few years now, but early access footage from a game entitled ""City Life Game With Friends"" has many players thinking that this could well be the next Sims game.
The video itselfis a full 20 minutes long and shows the player clicking through text prompts to select their outfit, hair, watch, activities, and so on. He then spawns into a sunlit Plaza de Poupon where he buys some food and mingles with the locals. He later goes to work in the outdoor café.
Characters are clearly called Sims throughout the playtest, talk in Simlish, and are adorned with The Sims' tell-tale Plumbob.
""I am terribly disappointed with Project Rene. Yes, I know, according to EA, 'this is not the final game.' Is this a joke or what?""said one unhappy playeron The Sims' subreddit on a post entitled ""I think Project Rene is a redflag (I hope not)"" that has been upvoted hundreds of times.
""EA clearly wants to kill off normal Sims games and push people toward the mobile-style experience. So in their mind, a reboot literally means this — at least that’s what I THINK.""
""This is not going to be for me, I can tell already,"" saidanother. ""It just seems so basic and I don't want to play The Sims on my phone.""
""The funny thing is, making a PC/mobile cross-compatible Sims game isn't a bad idea,""positeda fan. ""EA just believes that mobile games HAVE to be ugly for some reason. They're chasing all of the design trends of the past decade, but it means that this thing already looks dated and it's not even out yet.""
""The way The Sims was a literally [sic] satire about capitalist suburban consumption-as-happiness.... And this is where the Sims ended up. Endless consumption-as-happiness,""suggestedanother.
Project Rene — the codenamed game initially thought to be The Sims 5 until EA distanced itself from those rumors —was first teased in 2022during a Behind the Sims Summit. It's afree-to-playSims game that featuresmultiplayer inspired by Animal Crossing and Among Us. It hasn't yet been formally revealed or received a release date, but EA has been holding small,invite-only playtests for the gamesince its announcement, with the game's latest playtest presumably spawning these recent leaks.
The name Rene was chosen because it references words like ""renewal, renaissance, and rebirth"" that ""represent the developer's renewed commitment for the Sims' bright future.""
Last October, however,images of Project Rene leakedfrom a closed online test, prompting complaints about the art style, limited features, and the use of microtransactions. It was the addition of a café that drew the most skepticism, primarily due to the smiliaries to 2018's The Sims Mobile. It was then that EA said Project Rene was not The Sims 5 but would, in fact, be a different ""cosy, social game"" released under The Sims franchise.
Don't forget that The Burglar, a familiar sight for those of us who've spent time with any of the older Sims gamessnuck back into our livesas part of the latest update forThe Sims 4.

"Microsoft will bring Rockstar Games’Grand Theft Auto 5to Xbox Game Pass and GTA 5 Enhanced to Game Pass for PC on April 15.

This striking addition to the Wave 1 April 2025 lineup was announced in anXbox Wire post, revealing that the service’s biggest new title of the month is only a few weeks away from dropping. It’s an especially enticing reveal, as the PC Game Pass version of GTA 5 comes with that all-new Enhanced update Rockstar dropped in early March.
“No matter what version you’re playing, everyone will have access toOscar Guzman Flies Again, the latest update where you can take to the skies — taking control of the McKenzie Field Hanger in Grapeseed,” an official description from Xbox explained. “Play new arms trafficking missions, fly new aircraft, and more.”
Its arrival in two Tuesdays will mark a triumphant return to Game Pass after Rockstar’s open-world masterpiece was previously removed from the service. However, while the addition will mark the title's first time on PC Game Pass, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows as far as many die-hard GTA fans are concerned.
GTA 5 Enhanced arrived on PC March 4as a free update, bringing access to all the latest vehicles, performance upgrades in Hao’s Special Works, animal encounters, and visual bumps. It was a promising addition that also resulted in GTA 5 becomingRockstar’s worst-reviewed title on Steamas players latched onto account migration issues that kept them from bringing their GTA Online profiles over to the new version.
If you’re a newcomer to Los Santos, then you likely won’t have much to worry about. If you’re returning to the world of GTA 5 Online and looking to migrate your account over to that shiny new Enhanced upgrade, you might find yourself out of luck. For now, it appears the issues with account migration are still ongoing.
Meanwhile, we’re still waiting for any news aboutGrand Theft Auto 6. Our last GTA 6 update ensured thatRockstar intended to deliver its next open-world trend-setter sometime this fall, though we’restill waiting on that elusive release date.
While Rockstar works out the kinks ahead of GTA 5’s return to Game Pass, you can read up onthe rest of the Wave 1 April 2025 titles coming to Xbox Game Pass. You can also read up on how Rockstar is supporting the modding community bygranting them access to official tools.

"With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its wayandits audience.

Capcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.
But in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.
2016 was a bad year for Capcom.
The big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.
This was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.
All of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .
Achieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.
Capcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4.
2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema.
Unfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.
“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.
This directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op.
This downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.
But it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.
This slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.
It was clear something needed to change.
By the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability.
While neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.
“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”
Those constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6.
""We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V,"" Nakayama says. ""And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title.""
All this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards.“There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.
“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”
The team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.
There was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master.
“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.”
Street Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series.
While they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.
While Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.
Around the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience.
“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”
If you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.
“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”
Itsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance.
No other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened.
Firstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.
“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”
Monster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.
This created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.
But the reality was that Monster Hunterdidhave fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.
Released in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.
“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”
It was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”
It wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world.
“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”Tsujimoto says.
One important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.
This explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.
“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”
Monster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call.
“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&D teams were divided into R&D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”
Takeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.
There were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.
“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.
The game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series.
But Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time.
“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.
The result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history.
Naturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?
Ampo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”
But despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.
Around the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.
“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.”
Itsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.
The 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. ""Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively,"" Itsuno says. ""When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”
This vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should.
Ampo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, ""So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.”
This meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.
“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”
Since 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.
Focusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat.
But what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.
Many of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever.
When asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”
Monster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”

"As a part of Microsoft's ongoing efforts toimplement artificial intelligence into basically everything, the company is preparing to introduce its AI Copilot into your Xbox experience to give you gaming advice, help you remember where you left off last time you played, and perform other tasks.

Announced today, Copilot for gaming will be rolled out for Xbox Insiders through the Xbox mobile app sometime soon for testing. If you're not already aware, Copilot is Microsoft's existing AI chatbot (that replaced Cortana in 2023) that's already integrated into Windows. The gaming version will have a handful of features at launch. You can ask it to install games on your Xbox for you (a process you can already do now just by pushing a single button on the app), and you can also ask it about your play history (in case you forgot what you were doing last time you played), achievements, library, or for a recommendation of what to play next. You'll also be able to speak to Copilot for Gaming directly on the Xbox app while you're playing, and it will serve you answers in the same way Copilot currently does when asked questions via Windows.
Probably the biggest use-cases touted by Microsoft available at launch is Copilot as a gaming assistant. You can already ask Copilot questions about games any time on PC, such as how to beat a boss or solve a puzzle, and it will source answers via Bing from various online guides, websites, wikis, and forums. Soon, you'll also be able to ask it those same questions on the Xbox app.
""Our goal is to have Copilot for Gaming source the most accurate game knowledge — so we are working with game studios to make sure the information Copilot surfaces reflects their vision, and Copilot will refer players back to the original source of the information.""
Unshockingly, Microsoft does not intend to limit itself to just these Copilot functions. In a press briefing, Microsoft spokespeople discussed other future possibilities for Copilot in video games, including as awalkthrough assistant to explain basic game functions, remember where items where left in a game, or tell you where to find new ones, or as a helper in competitive games that could offer strategy suggestions and tips in real-time to counter opponents' moves, or explain how and why an engagement unfolded the way it did. Though it was emphasized that these were both just ideas they were toying with, the presentation made clear that Microsoft is insistant on finding ways to integrate Copilot closely with regular Xbox gameplay. And Microsoft confirmed to me that it will eventually work with not just first-party studios, but third-party studios for integration into their games as well.
With that in mind, I asked Microsoft if Copilot gaming would be opt in or opt out of use, or if users could opt out of having their data used to train it. The answer is that yes, Xbox Insiders can opt out during the preview, but the door was left open for Copilot to be mandatory in the future. Here's what a spokesperson said:
""During this preview on mobile, players will be able to decide how and when they want to interact with Copilot for Gaming, whether it has access to their conversation history, and what it does on their behalf.
""As we preview and test Copilot for Gaming with players early, we will continue to be transparent about what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices players have around sharing their personal data.""
IGN understands that Copilot is not being limited to just player-focused usage, and that Microsoft will be providing an overview on plans for developer use in asession at the Game Developers Conference on Monday next week.

"Palworldhas a big new update that adds crossplay across all platforms among many other new features.

Update v0.5.0 also lets players store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds. A new storage system has 10 times the capacity of the regular Palbox. Not only can guild members access it, but it can be used as a personal storage with private settings.
Elsewhere, you can now change your character’s appearance without affecting armor stats (transmog), there’s a photo mode, blueprint upgrading, and dedicated servers for Mac, among other changes detailed in the patch notes below.
Developer Pocketpair said it’s working on adding dedicated servers for the PlayStation 5 version and will release them at some point in the future.
Palworld has had an incredible32 million playerssince its early access launch in January 2024. The studio haslaid out a content roadmap for Palworld's 2025that looks fairly lengthy; alongside crossplay, there is an ""ending scenario"" and more new content on the way for the hugely popular creature-catching survival game.
Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC a year ago, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developercouldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success,signing a deal with Sonyto form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP, and launching the game on PS5.
Looming over all this isa lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, who seek ""an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages"" on the grounds that Palworld has allegedly infringed on ""multiple"" patent rights.Pocketpair has provided an update, identifying the patents the studio is allegedly infringing, and it has since tweaked how players summon Pals in Palworld, apparently in response. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in court, saying: “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”

"If you're thinking of jumping on the AMD bandwagon for your next upgrade, now is certainly the right time to do so. Alongside theRyzen 7 9800X3Dwhich debuted earlier this year, AMD has just released its two higher-end Ryzen 9 siblings in the Zen 5 ""X3D"" stack: the9950X3Dis available for $699 and the9900X3Dis available for $599. Collectively, these processors represent thebest gaming chipsacross both Intel and AMD. Pure gamers should go with the 9800X3D and allocate their funds elsewhere; creators with deeper pockets and a penchant for gaming will benefit from the immense performance uplift on the new Ryzen 9 processors thanks to their increased core count and cache.

Note: Processors are going in and out of stock (mostly out of stock, unfortunately).
Creative professionals who also want the best gaming chip on the market shouldn't think twice; this is the CPU to get. The new 9950X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.7GHz with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 144MB of L2-L3 cache. In terms of gaming, it's only a few percentage points better than than the 9800X3D. However, for productivity use, it easily outperforms the other two Zen 5 X3D chips, and anything offered by Intel for that matter.
AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas
""The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D might be the most powerful gaming processor on the market right now, but that doesn’t mean it has a de facto lead on every other chip on the market. Most people will have no problem getting by with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which just so happens to be much much more affordable at $479. Instead, the 9950X3D is geared towards gamers that both play games and use creative apps like Photoshop and Premiere, the latter of which sees a 15% performance improvement over the 9800X3D. For a pure gaming PC build, though, you’re probably better off saving that extra $220 for a better graphics card.""
AMD's X3D series processors are gaming optimized thanks to AMD's 3D V-Cache technology. However, since all three CPUs have the 3D V-cache loaded onto a single CCD, you get roughly the same gaming performance across all three chips. The minor differences are mostly due to the difference in clock speed. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.2GHz with 8 cores, 16 threads, and 104MB of L2-L3 cache Although perfectly capable of handling multitasking, rendering, and creation, the limited number of cores means they aren't the ideal processors for those tasks. However, this is an absolute monster of a processor for gaming, especially at this price point.
""The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is extremely powerful in games, which makes it easier to recommend than other recent processors like the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K or Ryzen 9 9900X. Especially if you’re building a rig with a powerful graphics card, the 9800X3D is going to be the best way to get the most performance out of whichever GPU you pair it with.""
The AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D is the processor you'd get if you do creative work and like to game, but you have a budget to adhere to and the 9950X3D crosses that line. The new 9900X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.5GHz with 12 cores, 24 threads, and 140MB of L2-L3 cache. This is the one chip we haven't reviewed yet, but from the specs, it's pretty easy to guess its performance. In terms of productivity tasks and multi-core workloads, it should perform somewhere in between the 9950X3D and 9800X3D. In terms of gaming, we expect it to be a wash compared to the other two.
If you decided to hold off onNvidia's Blackwell GPUs to see if AMD's new offeringswere up to snuff, then you made the right choice. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards are the new mid-range champions of this generation. Both cards offer phenomenal performance while undercutting their Nvidia competition in price. The Radeon RX 9070 starts at $550 and the 9070 XT starts at $600 (although it turns out that manufacturers are hiking the price again). Chect out ourRadeon RX 9070 GPU reviewandRadeon RX 9070 XT GPU reviewfor our benchmarks.

"The world ofOLED gaming monitorsis ever expanding, and it's becoming harder and harder for new models to stand out. But that's exactly what the Acer Predator X34 OLED does thanks to itsdeep-dish curveand immersive gaming experience. Coming in at $1,199 MSRP but frequently available for far less (I found it available at multiple retailers for $850 or under), it's a premium gaming monitor that’s able to deliver an exceptionally immersive gaming experience that many gamers are sure to enjoy. Just prepare for an adjustment period if you plan to use it for productivity.

The Acer Predator X34 OLED is a 34-inch ultra-wide gaming monitor designed to act as the flagship model for the brand. It comes with premium specs to deliver a fantastic gaming experience and is designed with a gaming-first ethos. It features a deep and immersive curve to create a gaming experience that seems to draw you in. This same quality makes it more challenging to use for productivity, so it won’t be a good fit for everyone, but for pure gaming it promises an exciting and engaging experience.
The monitor's on-paper specs are fantastic. Since it uses an OLED panel, it promises deep midnight blacks and a wide dynamic range that's able to reveal detail even in deep shadows. OLED currently offers the best image quality available in gaming monitors, and this most recent generation of panels, as is used here in this display, is less susceptible to burn-in and other drawbacks like text clarity. What you're left with is fantastic contrast, incredible colors, and high peak brightness rated at an impressive 1,300 nits.
Breaking that down a bit further, the X34 OLED is rated to cover 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut and 100% of sRGB. It features a dedicated sRGB mode for creators, as well DCI-P3 and Rec.709 modes to act as a reference for color-critical work. OLED monitors are well regarded for the richness and vibrancy of their colors, and the X34 is no exception. It comes well-calibrated out of the box, and its colors, while not oversaturated, appear very vivid.
Its brightness, while rated for 1300 nits, will only hit this in very, very small portions of the screen when running in HDR mode for standard definition content such as normal web browsing. It instead averages around 250 nits, which is relatively dim compared to an equally matched LCD monitor but typical of OLEDs due to power draw and heat. Generally, this is bright enough to use in a well-lit room comfortably, but the monitor should not be placed in direct sunlight.
The monitor has an ultra-wide design and measures 34 inches diagonally with a 21:9 aspect ratio. It has the wide equivalent of 1440p resolution, and due to the extra width, requires more GPU power to run effectively. It has a resolution of 3,440 x 1,440 pixels, which puts it in between a traditional 16:9 1440p monitor and 4K in terms of how difficult it is to run. To reach its maximum frame rate, you'll need abeefy GPUor be willing to lower graphics settings in demanding games. Even so, it's a great resolution for a screen of this size and results in a very crisp and detailed picture.
Check out more flat-panel options in our guide to theBest Gaming Monitors.
The Predator X34 OLED is fantastically responsive. OLED panels are naturally very fast, and Acer rates the monitor with a 0.01ms response time. I lack the tools to accurately test at such a low latency; however, it's typical for OLED panels to measure at 0.03ms, while other gaming monitors might top out at 0.5ms (more commonly, 1ms). This leads to bottomed out input latency, so, in a shooter for example, the clicks of your mouse appear on screen as gunshots measurably faster than IPS, VA, or TN based gaming monitors.
The X34 pairs this with a 240Hz refresh rate, meaning that it refreshes the screen 240 times every second. As I alluded to above, it would be very difficult to achieve such a high frame rate in any kind of demanding game, even with the top of the line GPU, unless you are runningDLSSandframe generation. Even if you don't always hit this (it's typically only feasible in esports and very non-demanding games), setting that high refresh rate results in lower input latency overall, so there’s still benefit to leaving that setting enabled. The higher your actual frame rate goes, motion clarity gets progressively better. For competitive games, this monitor is quite good.
The X34’s most defining feature is its deep 800R curve. The vast majority ofcurved gaming monitorscome in at 1800R or 1500R, both of which are fairly gentle. An 800R curvature is very pronounced and wraps into your peripheral vision to improve your immersion at the same time, but causes noticeable warping of text and images along its curve. For gaming, this doesn't matter since the wraparound effect is appealing, but for productivity, it definitely takes some getting used to. While some people don't mind it, many find it distracting compared to a shallower curve or even a flat panel.
The monitor supports a generous array of connectivity options. There are two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DisplayPort 1.4, and one USB Type-C with DisplayPort that’s also able to supply up to 90 watts of power. There’s also a built-in USB hub that offers two USB Type-A ports and an additional USB Type-C. This hub also acts as a KVM, so you can take connected accessories between hosts with the push of a button. The X34 also includes a headphone jack and sports two 5-watt speakers that get relatively loud and, while not as full-bodied as a separate pair of speakers, are better than most others you’ll find built into a gaming monitor.
The monitor also comes with a decent stand that is relatively thin, though it does have two long legs that protrude out to increase its overall footprint on your desk. It offers the ability to adjust height up and down a bit over four inches, tilt from -5 to +15 degrees, and pivot with a range of 15 degrees as well. The assembly is tool-less and easy to do, even if you've never set up your own monitor before. I recommend having an extra set of hands if at all possible to avoid needing to lay the monitor down on its face or risking putting pressure on its very fragile panel.
The OSD is straightforward and navigated using a joystick built into the display. It's fairly standard fare at this point with a number of different picture presets based on the genre, as well as the ability to adjust the gamma and saturation settings. It offers a sharpness setting as well as an OLED Care menu to toggle its different protective features on and off. There's also a uniform brightness setting, which limits overall brightness and reduces the fluctuations that occur when expanding full screen content. I didn't find this to be very noticeable, so I left it turned off, but if you're sensitive, the option is there.
It's also worth noting that Acer has an installable software suite to control many of these settings called Acer Display Widget. In truth, there are few monitor brands where the configuration software feels like more than an afterthought, and this isn't an exception. Still, you'll find most of your most used options here, so it's an effective alternative if you hate fiddling around with the actual OSD.
The Acer Predator X34 OLED is a gaming monitor first and foremost. That works to its benefit, but it can also be a detriment in other areas, like the aforementioned productivity concerns I outlined in the previous section. You also see that manifest in some other ways.
For pure gaming, it's great, but you should be prepared to either put a little work in or make a handful of concessions if you plan on using this as your daily driver for both work and play.
For starters, though its calibration isn't bad, it's not the most color accurate out-of-the-box, and would benefit from calibration for creative work. Grayscale accuracy measured a Delta E average of 4.78, tending toward the green end of the spectrum. Color accuracy was a bit better with a Delta E average of 3.12. With a calibration run using my SpyderPro colorimeter, I was able to dial that in to an average of 1.21, so it’s possible to get very good results (generally, anything under an average of 2.0 is considered well-calibrated).
Response time is excellent with no ghosting whatsoever. I would expect nothing less from an OLED gaming monitor, and particularly one that runs at 240Hz. Testing in the BlurBuster’s TestUFO Ghosting Test, there was no ghosting whatsoever. In-game, it's equally crisp with motion clarity that’s on par with the competition, which is to say: as good as any monitor can be at this point. Now, your skill will need to be equally matched to this level of clarity. Making a headshot mid-spin is still a skill that takes equally matched reaction time, but this removes one more glass ceiling for pro-level play.
The experience of daily driving the monitor is going to vary from person to person. As I mentioned before, for productivity, that text warping can be distracting. I tried using it for a bit of everything during my test window, and it's not a monitor I would choose if I was going to be writing or reading. Most of the time I was at my PC for creative work and video editing in particular, it was much better.
I especially liked it for video editing. The ability to see more of the timeline and have it wrap around visually a bit more made editing more efficient. Though I would be remiss to leave out that this would also be true if the curve wasn't there at all. Simply being able to view more of the timeline at any given point allows that efficiency. The curve just enhances the experience... if it's to your taste.
And that right there is the crux of this monitor. You have to love the curve, and it's not a given that you will, even if you enjoy other less-curved monitors. 800R is deep. It's made to simulate having two curved monitors in surround mode without a bezel in between. If you've been a PC gamer for a long time and have tried this yourself, then you’re likely to feel right at home. If the idea sounds ludicrous, then it's probably best to stick to a shallower curve.
I fall into that camp, having tried this setup myself only a few years ago. Regretfully, I only had 32-inch curved monitors to try it with, and it dominated not just my desk but what felt like half of my office, and since they were each 1440p, it was extremely difficult to run. It just wasn't practical. But for driving games, flight sims, and even many first-person games like Doom Eternal, it was quite immersive. It can also be pretty darn enrapturing.
So I like it. I really like it. It's a perfect fit for games like Microsoft Flight Simulator, but as someone drawn to this type of curvature in the first place, I also find a lot to enjoy with it in other genres too. I found myself scooting closer to the screen than I usually sit in Baldur's Gate 3, so it would occupy more of my peripheral vision. In Battlefield 2042, it felt a bit strange at first, but soon I was immersed in the game, feeling like I had my own wraparound view of the furious fray before me.
At least for me. That's the thing. This type of display is so subjective that I could only recommend picking it up blind if you have a return policy you can rely on. The quality of the monitor itself is excellent, but the experience of using it is something you really can't know without trying it or another that’s similar for yourself. If you like it, you'll probably come to downright love it in time. If you don't, you may just find that your expensive new gaming monitor is just plain untenable.
The Acer Predator X34 OLED has an MSRP of $1,199. At the time of this writing, I was able to find it on sale for only $799 through Amazon. It can be purchased throughAmazon,Best Buy, andB&H.
Whether or not the Acer Predator X34 OLED will be the right fit for you is ultimately going to be decided by how much you enjoy its curve. Removing that from the equation, it's a solid, high-performance monitor that offers a great picture and gaming experience. If you prefer something more flat, you’re going to want to look elsewhere. But if a deep curve is what you crave, there’s a whole lot to love."
"It’s been a wild 48-hour news cycle if you follow economics at all, and wilder still if you’re a Nintendo fan.

On Wednesday, we learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 would cost $450 in the United States, a painfully high price thatanalysts saywas partly due to expectation of tariffs, and partly due to other factors like inflation, competition, and component costs.
Then, last night, the Trump Administrationannounced wide-reaching 10% tariffson essentially every country, with much higher tariffs on numerous nations such as China, the EU, Japan, Vietnam, Canada, Mexico, and many, many others. In response, Chinaannounced this morninga 34% reciprocal tariff on all U.S. goods. And just hours ago, in the wake of all this, Nintendo announced it would bepostponing Nintendo Switch 2 pre-ordersin the U.S. while it evaluated the impact of tariffs on its console plans.
It’s an unprecedented situation for everyone, both within and outside of gaming, and one that analysts, experts, and the general public are still trying to make sense of. Which is why just a short 30 minutes before Nintendo dropped its shocking pre-order news, I was on the phone with Aubrey Quinn, a spokesperson for the Entertainment Software Association, to discuss the impact these tariffs would have on the industry writ large.
The ESA, like everyone else, is still trying to figure out how all this is going to play out. Broadly, she says, they have some expectations. They knew tariffs of some sort were coming – both due to Trump’s past actions in his first administration and his repeated discussion of them on the campaign trail. And, once implemented, Quinn says they expected there would be risk of retaliation from other countries like China, as well as even more future tariffs and levies from the U.S. But the jury is still out on how this will ultimately play out.
What the ESA does feel confident saying, though, is that these tariffs will have a negative impact on video games:
“We really are, at this point, just watching and trying not to have knee-jerk reactions, because we don't think that what President Trump announced this week is the end of the story, but what was announced this week and the tariffs as outlined, we do expect these tariffs will have a real and detrimental impact on the industry and the hundreds of millions of Americans who love to play games,” Quinn says. “And so our goal is to work with the administration, to work with other elected officials to try to find a solution that doesn't damage U.S. industries, U.S. business, but also American gamers and families.”
When Quinn says there will be a detrimental impact, she doesn’t just mean the cost of systems, though she says it’s “hard to imagine a world where tariffs like these don’t impact pricing.” She says consumer spending will also be impacted, which will in turn impact company revenue. If companies see their profits drop, that will in turn impact jobs, as well as investment in research and development, and even what the next generation of consoles looks like. “The entire consumer ecosystem is connected,” she says.
So what’s the ESA doing about it? Well, a few things so far, but Quinn acknowledges it’s been difficult to get started. Even though the tariffs didn’t come as a surprise to anyone, she says the Trump Administration hasn’t been back in office for long – really just two months. Trump’s cabinet and administration is almost entirely made up of new people, too, so the ESA hasn’t been able to leverage relationships from his last term in office. And some of them were only appointed weeks ago.
“But yes, the short answer is we know who the conversations need to be happening with, and we are working on making connections and making sure that they understand that we are eager to work with them to find solutions that this is about public, private sector conversations happening, so we can understand and make sure that they see the impact and the risk of impact to business, to consumers, and really everything that's happening within the US borders,” she concludes.
Quinn points to the recent news that the ESA had already joined a coalition of trade associations to reach out to U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer and express their concerns prior to the tariff news earlier this week. And they’re asking for meetings with a number of legislations and members of the administration to discuss similar topics.
Is it working, I ask? Are they being heard?
“Yes. I can tell you conversations are happening with... I don't want to say every level,” she responds. “I've not met with Trump, right? So I don't want to say every level of government, but certainly we've met with members of the administration. We've met with employees at the White House, we've met with employees at USTR [the office of the United States Trade Representative], so yes, we are having conversations and we're also doing that in partnership with other associations to make sure that... This isn't a video game issue. I represent the video game industry, so I'm very aware of the impact on the video game industry, the potential impact, but it's not a video game industry. This is going to affect all consumer products from food to fashion to electronics.”
So what can consumers do about it if they’re concerned? Reach out to their representatives, Quinn responds. Write letters, call, send emails, tweets, whatever it looks like to let their elected leaders know they’re concerned. “I think the more members of government, elected officials, and their staff who hear that their constituents are concerned, the more likely we are to be heard and to potentially make an impact.”
Nintendo announced its hold on Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders due to the tariffs just minutes after our conversation had concluded. When I reached out to Quinn for further comment on that, she said the ESA doesn’t comment on what individual companies will do. But I did mention the Nintendo Switch 2’s already-high pricing at the end of our conversation, and Quinn had this to say:
“You know what? It's been interesting with media coverage around video games and tariffs because just unfortunate coincidental timing that the Switch [2 reveal] was the same day as President Trump's announcement. There are so many devices we play video games on. There are other consoles, but as I was saying, VR headsets, our smartphones, people who love PC games, if we think it's just the Switch, then we aren't taking it seriously. This is going to have an impact.
“And even American-based companies, they're getting products that need to cross into American borders to make those consoles, to make those games. And so there's going to be a real impact regardless of company. This is company-agnostic, this is an entire industry. There's going to be an impact on the entire industry.”

"I think today might be the day my wallet throws in the towel. Woot is coming in hot with one of thebest PS5 game dealsI’ve seen all year, and Sony’s decided we’ve all earned a full-blown audio upgrade. Between the markdowns onnoise-canceling headphones,portable speakers, andhome theater gear, it's giving ""treat yourself"" energy with ""I won’t regret this at all"" delusion.

I want at least three of these, but I’m pretending to be financially responsible and only putting two in my cart. If you’ve been eyeballing anything fromhigh-end headphonestosmart display cases for your action figures (I meancollectibles), now’s probably the best time to stop window shopping and start adding to your cart.
This Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code ""IFPRZAZ"" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16"" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.
$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.
I think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.
If you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.
At $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.
$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.
This speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.
Crisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.
This speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.
Bass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.
XM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.
A wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.
My living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.
I didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.
This TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.
I want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.
This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.

All PlayStation 5 consoles also come with Astro's Playroom, the original game/tech demo that kicked off our infatuation with the adorable robot.
Astro Bot Reviewby Simon Cardy
""Astro Bot made me smile from beginning to end. A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive. And while you don’t need a long history with Sony systems to enjoy it, it is especially a delight for those with a piece of PlayStation in their heart as a treasure trove full of playable nostalgia awaits. Taking the PS5 marketing mantra that “play has no limits” more seriously than you’d expect, Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it.""

"Rockstar’s new and improved version ofGrand Theft Auto 5isn’t going down well on Steam following its launch earlier in March.

Grand Theft Auto 5 Enhanced, which released on March 4, has a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, with 54% of the 19,772 user reviews flagged as positive.
To put that into context, the original GTA 5 on Steam, now unlisted at the request of Rockstar Games and as a result unable to appear in search on Valve's platform, has a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam.
In fact, GTA 5 Enhanced is currently the worst user-reviewed GTA on Steam, with its closest competitor for the unwanted crown,Grand Theft Auto III – The Definitive Edition, on 66% positive reviews.
GTA 5 Enhanced is a free upgrade for GTA 5 on PC that includes sought-after features previously only available in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S versions ofGTA Online— including all the latest vehicles and performance upgrades available at Hao’s Special Works, animal encounters, and access to purchase a GTA+ Membership — along with improved graphics options and faster loading times. All players who currently own GTA 5 on PC can upgrade to this new version for free, with the ability to migrate your Story Mode and Online progress.
You’d think that would be a relatively straightforward process, but it appears the account migration isn’t working as intended for many players. Indeed, account migration problems are at the heart of most of the negative reviews flagged as ‘most helpful.’
“ ‘The GTA Online profile associated with this Rockstar Games account is not eligible for migration at this time,’ ” reported one disgruntled player. “If you think I'm throwing away nearly 700 hours of gameplay on one character so that you can make a few more bucks off me, then you can lick my anal orifice clean.
“This is an objective downgrade from the ‘old’ version. Gonna pretend this was never released and continue to enjoy Legacy version until the new game comes out when I'm 60.”
“I'm leaving a negative review mainly due to Rockstar deciding that some accounts should arbitrarily not be able to migrate, and if you ask for help from support, they just say they can't do anything about it,” reads another.
""I can't migrate either of my two accounts,"" another negative review reads. ""R* support is completely useless and can't help. With the game being over 10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years old I am sure as hell not going to completely restart all my progress in Online just to get marginally better graphics (if that) and HSW and whatever other minuscule ♥♥♥♥ they added.""
Despite these issues, GTA 5 Enhanced remains one of the most-played games on Steam, with a 187,059 peak concurrent player count since launch. But it has sparked concern over the inevitable PC release ofGrand Theft Auto 6, with some PC gamers worrying that Rockstar's struggles with GTA 5 Enhanced could signal launch trouble down the line.
GTA 6 is planned for launch during the fall of 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only, leaving PC gamers out in the cold. In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstarattempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hitsconsole, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.
We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including Take-Two boss StraussZelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out. Meanwhile,Take-Two has sued online marketplace PlayerAuctions, alleging it contains ""thousands of listings for unauthorized, infringing GTA 5 content – including heavily modified player accounts, in-game assets, and virtual currency – all gained by using hacking software, cheats, and technical exploits.""
And in other news,Rockstar recently acquiredGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Editiondeveloper Video Games Deluxeand renamed it Rockstar Australia.

"Um dos gêneros mais populares e importantes dos videogames na última década foi o soulslike. Encabeçado pela FromSoftware e títulos como Dark Souls, Bloodborne e, mais recentemente, Elden Ring, essa categoria derivada dos RPGs de ação reverbera sucessos há 10 anos. Para embarcar nessa onda, a desenvolvedora Neople e a publicadora Nexon criaram The First Berserker: Khazan, novo soulslike baseado no universo do aqui no Brasil quase desconhecido Dungeon Fighter Online, que deixa as raízes de Dark Souls de lado para se inspirar em Nioh e nos soulslikes da Team Ninja.
Durante as minhas mais de 35 horas de jogo, pude encontrar muitas qualidades no combate e construção de builds baseadas nos inúmeros itens que podemos combinar, mas me senti extremamente entediado com um level design fraco, uma repetição de inimigos no mínimo esquisita e personagens desinteressantes. The First Berserker: Khazan é um jogo muito intenso para o bem e para o mal, mas consegue demonstrar proeminência naquilo que se propõe a ser: um soulslike desafiador.
Com uma narrativa um tanto quanto comum em histórias de brucutus em busca de vingança, o jogo segue esse mesmo caminho e nos apresenta Khazan, um poderoso general do império de Pell Los, que é condenado injustamente e exilado para montanhas nevadas por traição ao imperador. No entanto, o acaso do destino faz com que ele seja “salvo” por um espírito maligno que o possui e assim começa uma longa jornada de vingança. A premissa é bastante básica, mas a extensão do universo faz com que a narrativa ganhe camadas de profundidade, embora nenhuma delas consiga tornar o enredo cativante de verdade.
Mesmo com reviravoltas mirabolantes, a trama de traição se mantém clichê do início ao fim e em diversos momentos é sonolenta. Os personagens de suporte também são imemoráveis e apenas uma se destacou para mim entre aliados e inimigos: Elamein. Apesar de o vilão ser bom, ele não sustenta a trama fraca. A história é definitivamente o ponto mais baixo do jogo, mas que não pesa tanto graças ao combate sólido e eficiente – pelo menos na maioria das vezes.
O ponto de maior destaque e brilho de The First Berserker: Khazan é, sem dúvidas, o combate. Extremamente fluido, veloz, intenso, cheio de variedade de armas e habilidades. O game é um soulslike bastante voltado para o parry, mas não de uma forma semelhante a Sekiro. Aqui, a ausência de escudo obriga você a dominar a habilidade de aparar ataques e de desviar no momento certo, porém a esquiva é curta e muitas vezes é a pior opção para escapar de ataques.
Quando partirmos para o ataque, no entanto, vemos aqui onde a equipe da Neople depositou grande parte dos esforços. Khazan é como uma mistura de Kratos, o Chosen One de Dark Souls e o Lobo de Sekiro — tudo isso parece confuso, mas quando o controlamos as coisas se alinham. O jogo apresenta três opções de arma: lanças, empunhadura dupla com espada e machado e, por fim, a espada de duas mãos. Na minha gameplay, optei pela lança na maior parte do tempo, afinal, o dano me pareceu mais equilibrado e a velocidade de ataque me satisfez mais.
O crescimento da jogabilidade é exponencial: no começo temos combos simples e ataques com dardo — semelhante ao arco e flecha. No entanto, conforme aprofundamos a vasta árvore de habilidades de Khazan, as lutas se tornam mais fluidas, sangrentas e polidas de certa forma. Mesmo assim, não pude deixar de observar que em algumas situações a hitbox me pareceu meio confusa e até mesmo problemática, tanto para inimigos quanto para armadilhas do cenário, mas foram casos bem específicos e que não se repetiram.
Os combos de lança são dinâmicos e se encaixaram perfeitamente na minha gameplay. Consegui acabar com inimigos rapidamente, mas precisamos falar sobre o equilíbrio de dificuldade muito peculiar que o jogo apresenta.
Quanto às batalhas de chefe, algumas são básicas, desde a música e movimentos do inimigo até as arenas, enquanto outras mostram o potencial do jogo e exigem o uso máximo das mecânicas de The First Berserker. Na minha experiência pessoal, nenhuma delas merece grande destaque, exceto a batalha final que é digna de um grande RPG de ação pela magnitude do combate.
Um grande destaque do jogo é a criação de builds que se baseia muito nos sistemas de Nioh. É possível ter muito controle dos status do personagem e adaptar Khazan para a sua arma e jogabilidade. Itens do mesmo set concedem bônus conforme você equipá-los e acumular status.
O único sistema ruim de combate é o de invocações, que não ajudam em nada durante as batalhas de chefe e muitas vezes apenas atrapalham. No entanto, os fantasmas são um bom suporte em lutas rotineiras.
Obviamente, por ser um soulslike, The First Berserker: Khazan possui uma dificuldade acentuada, mas os picos de complexidade em progredir no jogo são… esquisitos. Alguns chefes e mapas iniciais são muito difíceis, enquanto algumas batalhas intermediárias contra inimigos de elite e até mesmo os chefões não apresentam desafio, e, por fim, as batalhas mais avançadas são surpreendentemente fáceis. Isso seria normal caso esses picos de dificuldade fossem parte da progressão que, obviamente, fica menos complexa conforme o avançar do jogo, mas The First Berserker tem uma inconsistência de dificuldade que, a meu ver, mostra uma falha de balanceamento no jogo que empobrece a experiência.
Um dos maiores destaques da FromSoftware em Dark Souls é o mapa minuciosamente conectado que possui atalhos e conexões que exploram a sagacidade dos designers em produzir essas fases. Infelizmente, por optar em se inspirar na Team Ninja e jogos como Nioh e Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, o level design de The First Berserker: Khazan se perde em diversos momentos.
Apesar de contar com áreas vastas e alguns atalhos, muitas regiões do mapa parecem sem vida ou possuem conexões um tanto quanto sem sentido que seriam melhores apenas colocando outra espada da fenda, a “bonfire” do game, para tornar a ligação entre áreas dos biomas mais inteligentes. O jogo poderia olhar mais para Lies of P e criar um level design muito melhor, mas se inspirou justamente em soulslikes com design de mapa problemáticos.
A má qualidade do level design se alinha à repetitividade de inimigos, aspecto ainda mais evidente quando olhamos para as missões secundárias, que reutilizam esses cenários com pequenas mudanças e tornam o jogo cansativo ao longo do tempo.
The First Berserker: Khazan é intenso para o bem e para o mal. Quando o jogo está imerso em seu combate, criação de builds e algumas batalhas de chefe, ele brilha e muito, quase alcançando a prateleira dos ótimos soulslikes. Contudo, o level design ruim, repetição de inimigos, história sonolenta e dificuldade inconsistente fazem ele cair de patamar e ser só mais um soulslike, embora ainda figure entre os bons títulos do gênero, não mais do que isso. Os amantes de Nioh e de jogatinas difíceis encontrarão muita diversão em mais de 35 horas de campanha."

"Helldivers 2has a new patch that makes key balance changes and bug fixes to Sony's third-person co-op shooter.

Patch 01.002.200 tweaks the balance on a number of weapons and stratagems. Developer Arrowhead also increased the number of AI calculations the game can perform, which primarily impacts scenarios with a high number of spawned enemies, improving their response times in those situations. However, this comes with a slight trade-off in game performance, Arrowhead said.
The upshot of these gameplay changes is that the Automatons specifically will present a tougher challenge as they now have increased reaction speed in large groups. Expect Helldivers 2's already imposing bots to act smarter and make decisions faster.
And here’s a useful improvement: the stratagem loadout menu has undergone an updated categorization of the different stratagem groupings.
Meanwhile, publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment announced Helldivers 2’s next Warbond, called Borderline Justice. The theme this time is 'space cowboy,' and in keeping with that theme there are new weapons including the R-6 Deadeye lever-action hunting rifle, the LAS-58 Talon ""revolver"" secondary, and the TED-63 Dynamite.
The GS-17 Frontier Marshal is space cowboy-themed medium Helldiver set, as is the GS-66 Lawmaker heavy armor, which comes complete with cowboy holster and bandolier. The Gunslinger armor passive gives your secondary increased reload speed, increased draw/holster speed, and reduced recoil. The warbond launches March 20.
Helldivers 2’s ongoing Galactic War is currently focusing on the Illuminate alien faction,which is slowly pushing a black hole towards Super Earth. Where this is going is anyone’s guess, but speculation points to potentially taking the fight to the Illuminate’s home world, or maybe finally fighting back on Super Earth itself.

"Update 2:30pm PT:Wizards of the Coast has issued a statement on the DMCA from earlier today, saying that it happened in error and apologizing for the situation:

""The Baldur’s Village DMCA takedown was issued mistakenly – we are sorry about that,"" the statement reads. ""We are in the process of fixing that now so fans and the Stardew community can continue to enjoy this great mod!""
At the time of this update,the mod was still under review, but it seems likely this will be rectified shortly.
Original story continues below:
Wizards of the Coast has issued a DMCA takedown notice on a fan mod of Stardew Valley that adds Baldur's Gate 3 characters, despite the mod previously having been publicly praised by Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke. And now, Vincke has responded to the takedown as well.
As reported by PC Gamer, the mod in question is entitled ""Baldur's Village"" and incorporates Baldur's Gate 3 characters into Stardew Valley. The modreleased earlier this month, and shortly after, Vincke took to Twitter to praise it, saying ""So much love went into this - amazing work!""
Unfortunately, just weeks later, the mod is gone. According to a Nexus Mods spokesperson speaking t PC Gamer, Dungeons & Dragons and Baldur's Gate IP holder Wizards of the Coast has issued a DMCA takedown of the mod. ""Hopefully, this is an oversight from WotC, who often use external agencies to hunt down violating content, and they will revert their decision,"" said the spokesperson. ""Fingers crossed for Baldur's Village.""
Then, just today, Vincke commented on the situation again on Twitter, once again expressing support for the mod while acknowledging that IP protection is tricky:
Protecting your IP can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled. There are good ways of dealing with this.
""Free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth,"" he said. ""Imho they shouldn't be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property. Protecting your IP can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled. There are good ways of dealing with this.""
It's possible this is part of a larger crackdown from Wizards of the Coast around Baldur's Gate. As we learned at the Game Developers Conference earlier this month, we're supposedly going to hear more about what the company has planned for the IP ""in pretty short order"", so maybe this free Stardew Valley mod was somehow in conflict with that. Or maybe it was a mistake that will quickly be rectified. We've reached out to Wizards of the Coast for comment.

"Samsung came in strong with today’s deals, and I have to admit, I’m eyeing a couple of them up.The 49-inch Odyssey G9 gaming monitorlooks like something pulled straight from a sci-fi movie.The Galaxy Tab S10+ 5Gis basically a laptop in disguise, and theGalaxy Z Flip 6is making flip phones cool again. If that’s not enough, theS24 Ultrais here to remind every other smartphone who’s boss, and theSSD dealsare giving me a solid excuse to finally clean up my storage situation.

Some of these discounts are impressive, like$500 off that insane QD-OLED monitor. Others, like theSonic statueandRimWorld deal, are more like little bonus treats for the fans. Either way, if you’ve been waiting for a solid sale on a gaming monitor, a high-end phone, or a storage upgrade, Samsung has something worth looking at today.
AliExpress has brand new PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch OLED consoles on sale for prices you won't find anywhere else. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming console that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by youraccount, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item.
I want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.
This phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.
I didn’t know I needed an 11-inch Sonic statue until now. The detail is impressive, the LED lights make it pop, and it’s half off. If you’re a Sonic fan, this is an easy yes. If you’re not, well, now’s a great time to start.
I can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.
RimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.
This SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.
I never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.
I think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.

Why buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.

It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.
Still using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.
These aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.
These Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.
Luxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.
This isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.

"Rejoice, fellow Nintendo fans. On Wednesday, the clouds parted, the sun rose, and the divine spectra; hand of Miyamoto reached down from the sky to grace us with Nintendo’s newest handheld carnival of joy, the Switch 2. After years of speculation, we finally have a clear look at the mysterious console hybrid.

Sadly, while sleek, compact, and powerful, the rumours are untrue. The Switch 2 does not in fact pack a tiny little Reggie into every GPU. But after we spent an hour during the Direct glued to every word: dissecting it, screenshotting every image, poring over captured video for tiny clues to its form and function, we can finally apply something besides guesswork and give you some solid facts, including all the ways it leaves its beloved predecessor in the dust.
This is probably the least-surprising revelation as practically every next-gen Nintendo console has been significantly improved over its predecessor (yes, even the Wii). Still, when released in 2017, Switch was hardly a cutting-edge powerhouse in comparison to Sony and Xbox consoles, and eight years later it noticeably struggles under demanding games. Nintendo and its partners were increasingly running up against the limitations of the hardware.
This week we saw elements on display promising us a vastly improved experience: handheld resolutions up to 1080p, docked up to 4K, both with HDR, and framerates extending up to 120 fps. It’s a welcome upgrade that should allow a wider variety of games to come to Switch 2. We may already see some of the fruit in EA’s decision to host soccer and football games on Switch 2, and 2K’s intention to do the same with wrestling and basketball.
Third parties revealed all manner of current-gen games to give us some idea of the Switch 2’s increased capabilities, and what we saw was encouraging: a console/handheld capable of handling Elden Ring, Street Fighter 6, and other demanding software. And what Nintendo showed of their new first-party offerings was simply gorgeous.
The little purple lunchbox that could finally comes to Nintendo Switch Online, exclusively available on Switch 2. Nintendo has effectively drawn a fence between online experiences on Switch and Switch 2, and that means that from this point forward those who want to play some of Nintendo’s best retro games are going to have to shell out for better hardware. Sure, it’s only three games right now, but those three games are absolute bangers: The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and, holy crap, Soul Calibur 2, complete with Link.
Okay, seriously. Soul Calibur 2 is incredible. If you’ve never played it with a friend you are in for such a treat.
When humanity later reviews and catalogues the glorious day in video game history, the opening chapter won’t be about how Mario Kart is now like Forza Horizon, or about Donkey Kong’s return in Bananza, or even about the announcement of the until-now secret project called Duskblood. Instead, the book will open and perhaps also close with the most significantly un-Nintendo thing to happen this week: easy integration of online features commonly available on other platforms.
The company that brought us Friend Codes now graces us with GameChat, a feature-rich communication and visual sharing feature set for Switch 2. A noise-cancelling mic picks up your voice and shares it with friends. An optional desktop camera allows you to share your face, both in window-corners and in compatible games like Mario Party. You can also share screens across consoles remotely. It’s much of what we gave up on asking Nintendo for years ago... a simple, straightforward tool for playing with friends. I’m looking forward to seeing how it actually plays out.
So much potential awaits with this feature. Where my mind keeps going is Monster Hunter, with teams of four benefitting from shared screens as they pursue and trap their prey. It’s simply become unthinkable for Nintendo to voluntarily offer fans such a useful array of online features, but here we are living in the future at last.
Okay, we’d already guessed this but it’s still really cool. Joy-Cons now magnetically snap to the Switch 2 body rather than slotting in. Nintendo showed off how the steel shoulder buttons on each controller attract to the magnetic facing along the sides of the screen, locking them together. A press of a button releases the magnetic grip.
This is a pretty great feature for my home setup, where a shelf top obstructs removing the Joy-Cons without removing the entire Switch from the dock, which sometimes leads to knocking the whole thing down. I’m a fan.
Bigger isn’t always better with handhelds, but given the sharper resolution of the 1080p portable screen and the nature of most Switch games, the slight increase in size to 7.9 inches should be a net gain for most players. The first Switch sacrificed screen real estate for portability but I think Nintendo is making the right call in giving these elaborate, feature -rich games more space to shine.
Nintendo was weirdly excited to show off its innovative Joy-Con mouse features. A Switch 2 Joy-Con laid on its side can be scooted across a tabletop, and its telemetry tracked to provide precise pointing and rotation. It looks to be heavily-supported at launch by games like Drag x Drive, Civ 7, and Metroid Prime 4.
I do love wacky Nintendo. My guess is the mouse feature won’t see much use past launch window (much like the microphone on the old DS) but I’m actually 1000% in on playing Metroid Prime 4 with a mouse. As a PC gamer, I rarely enjoy FPS games that force me to use a controller, so this surprising option feels a bit liberating. Hopefully we get Mario Paint 2.
This one is more of a double-edged sword. Nintendo crammed the Switch 2 with 256GB of external storage, much more than the original Switch. But with all the Switch 2’s extra graphics capacity, those asset-rich game files are going to be much bigger too, so it may be close to a wash. The memory is quicker as well to deal with larger game files, which means you’ll need a new, faster memory card for your supplemental storage.
Nintendo tweaked the Switch hardware in response to nearly a decade of feedback. Switch 2 now features two USB-C ports, with one added on top to assist in charging while playing in kickstand mode. Nintendo added a fan to the doc to aid in cooling consistency. Sticks are larger and sound capabilities are improved.
Even the Switch 2 Pro Controller is a step up, with an audio jack (at last!) and assignable buttons. No telling yet if the new controller contains the same miniaturized star that exists at the core of every Switch Pro Controller, giving it near-unlimited battery life.
And one of the most subtle features might be most useful. I do a fair bit of Switch playing on my tabletop. The fact that the Switch 2 screen angle is adjustable in kickstand mode is a huge deal for me. Too often, ambient light at an airport or the angle of a tight airplane tray table make playing in kickstand seem like an exercise in futility. But with the ability to subtly shift angles, coupled with the new mouse feature, leads me to believe I might actually be able to enjoy a serious game of Civilization 7 on the go.
So first off, Switch 2 is backward compatible. That’s always good. Microsoft has already blazed a pretty amazing trail toward optimized backward compatibility on Xbox, and Nintendo has also wisely taken a note from its own Gamecube to Wii to WiiU history, making most Switch games a snap to play on new hardware. Backward capacity helps sell consoles their first year.
While the Nintendo Switch 2 is backward compatible with Switch games, it also supports special new Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of certain Switch titles like Metroid Prime 4. These enhanced titles offer new features including a selection between a higher-res Quality Mode or a faster frame rate in Performance Mode.
One really cool feature of these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions is that if you already own the original game on Switch, you will be able to purchase a simple Switch 2 Edition upgrade and enjoy all the new features on your new hardware.  Let's hope it's not too expensive.
It’s also possible that Switch 2 Editions of Switch’s notoriously-janky Pokemon games could be improved by these features. Let's hope so. Throwing hardware at things can’t solve every problem but sometimes it really helps.
Mario Kart World does everything we expect of Mario Kart and adds two key elements. The first is the ability to traverse a continuous world Forza Horizon-style, racing from course to course, free mode exploring, fooling around, and so on. The second is the swelling of the field size to 24 carts, which is, well, a lot to get one’s head around when the shells start flying. It sounds like absolute bedlam. I can’t wait.
Nintendo took its time showing off new games but toward the end of the show we bought about a minute tease of a new Kirby’s Air Ride game, Kirby’s Air Riders, an announcement that would likely have resulted in a thunderous snooze were it not for the surprising involvement of one Mr. Sakurai, known equally for his self-immolating work ethic and his status as god of Smash Bros. I love Kirby, but Air Ride sucked... BUT it’s Sakurai so I’m now 100% in.
Then there was The Duskbloods, a trailer that produced some hysterics in me. At first I thought it was Bloodborne 2, then I thought it was a licensed FROM Software take on Castlevania, and then finally I accepted that what I was seeing was an entirely original Miyazaki game exclusive to Switch. My friends, remember: FROM Software does not miss. Probably you will die. Probably you will dodge roll. Certainly you will have a blast.
And of course; the real King of Kong makes his triumphant return to 3D with Donkey Kong Bananza. It’s a moment of absolution for Nintendo: 26 years after dropping the barbequed turd Donkey Kong 64 on an unsuspecting planet, a wiser, more skilled Nintendo has returned to the drawing board with what’s sure to be a landmark adventure.
Nintendo devs have been absolutely murdering 3D platforming on the Switch, not just with Odyssey and Bowser’s Fury, but also with Kirby’s incredible journey to the shores of the Forgotten Lands. Bananza was constructed to showcase far more capable hardware than these modern-day classics, which means that the devs had opportunities to iterate on ideas that wouldn’t have been possible on a basic Switch.

"Gaming hardware company ASUS has pulled back the curtain at what may be the reported Xbox-branded handheld device.

The ASUS Republic of Gamers X/Twitter account shared ateasershowing its ""little robot friend cooking something up,"" offering a brief glimpse at both a Republic of Gamers (ROG) Xbox controller and handheld system.
Last month, IGN reported on Microsoft’s video game hardware ambition, which allegedly includes a full next-gen Xbox for 2027 and anXbox-branded gaming handheld that may launch later in 2025.
That's not our only clue, either. The handheld shown in ASUS's teaser clearly shows off buttons configured for Xbox (Y, B, A, and X, rather than PlayStation's triangle, circle, cross, and square, or Nintendo's X, A, B, and Y). There's also a D-pad, two thumbsticks, and four smaller additional buttons, although it's pretty hard to make those out clearly.
Perhaps most interestingly of all, though, the official Xbox accountacknowledged the tweetwith a cheeky wide-eyed gif, suggesting this is all setting up a reveal.
pic.twitter.com/ONZpeEmNka
Unfortunately, that's all we have. There's no date on the reveal yet, let alone a concrete launch window, but the monitor the little robot is working on states ""Marathon stamina, more capacity, faster speeds"" and ""fresh look!"" giving us an idea of what the handheld's unique selling points may be.
In January, Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s VP of ‘Next Generation,’ toldThe Vergethat the company plans to combine Xbox and Windows experiences together for PC gaming handhelds made by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), otherwise known as third-party hardware manufacturers. Existing PC gaming OEMs include ASUS, Lenovo, and Razer.
While this Xbox-branded gaming handheld is not a Microsoft-made console, the company is reportedly planning to finally launch one of its own in 2027, potentially alongside its next-gen Xbox.Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer recently indicated a first-party Xbox handheld is years away.
Speaking of which, the successor to the Xbox Series X is now allegedly ""fully"" in production and due out in two years, tying in with Xbox president Sarah Bond's recent comments thatMicrosoft was ""moving full speed ahead on our next generation hardware, focused on delivering the biggest technological leap ever in a generation.""
For some time now, there's been much speculation around the future of consoles, with Netflix's President of Games, Alain Tascan, recently stating that he expectsa future generation that relies less on gaming consolesdespite major players like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo pushing forward with new hardware. The latter'shighly anticipated Switch 2 devicewill be showcased in a Nintendo Direct on April 2, with many fans expecting to hear more aboutwhat features the Switch 2 brings to the table, its release date, andhow pre-orders will be managed.

"Amazon quietly restocked a bunch ofPokémon TCG bundles just days agoand stock is already running low. These Scarlet & Violet sets have been MIA for weeks, and now they’re back at retail prices. I already added a couple to my cart,Surging SparksBooster Bundle,Shrouded FableETB and Paldean Fates Booster Bundle. Trainers need to snap these up quick. If they’re gone by the time you get there, that’s on you.

Looking for the least expensive PlayStation 5 console you can your hands on? As part of its US Anniversary Sale, AliExpress is offering an importedSony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Editiongaming console for $367.94 shipped after $80 off coupon code ""MAYUE008"". This is a brand new and retail boxed product that is stocked in a US warehouse and qualifies for local delivery, which means it ships free and arrives within about 1-2 weeks.
I also spotted a couple of power banks on sale from INIU and Anker. If you’ve ever watched your phone die mid-flight or mid-text, you know why I’m excited. These things are cheap, fast, and less annoying than asking strangers for a charger at an airport. Do with that information what you will. Oh, and while we’re on the topic of things I absolutely don’t need but definitely want: theGamera: Attack of Legionaction figure is up for preorder at the IGN Store for a cool $560, and Humble Bundle just dropped a massiveDragonlance book bundlethat practically dares you to add 25+ fantasy novels to your backlog for the price of lunch.
I want this bundle purely for the thrill of cracking six packs in a row and pretending I’m building a deck for Worlds. The Surging Sparks expansion is still new enough to feel fresh, and at $45.02, it’s a decent value compared to scalper prices that make you question your financial decisions. If you just want to dip into the latest set without going full collector mode, this is it.
Shiny Pokémon are back, and apparently so is my addiction to them. The Paldean Fates bundle gives you six chances to pull something sparkly, and while $69.94 isn’t exactly pocket change, I think the potential dopamine hit is worth the gamble. It’s in stock, it ships fast, and I’ve made worse choices at 2 a.m. on eBay.
I’m not saying this is the nerdiest thing you can buy today, but it’s definitely on the leaderboard. Humble Bundle just dropped a massive Dragonlance collection; 25+ books for about the cost of lunch. If you’ve ever wanted to get lost in magical twin drama, cursed artifacts, or the politics of dwarves (because who hasn’t), this is your sign. Plus, part of your purchase supports Room to Read, so now your TBR pile can come with good karma.
In my opinion, this is the one to grab if you're all-in on the set. Nine booster packs, a Pecharunt promo, themed sleeves, dice, and an actually-useful storage box? For $54.96? I’ve spent more on less at Taco Bell. Plus, it's still Prime eligible, which means you don’t have to sell your soul for free shipping. Win-win.
This is what happens when you give kaiju collectors exactly what they want: a 9.5-inch figure of LEGION fromGamera 2, complete with flying parts, glowing bits, and articulation that would make Spider-Man jealous. Sure, it’s $560, but I’ve seen statues half as cool go for double that. If you’re the kind of person who rearranges shelf space for something before buying it, I totally get it.
This thing charges your phone like it’s got something to prove. At $26.98, it gives you a full week’s worth of backup power and a built-in flashlight just in case you drop your phone and your dignity under your car seat. I want it purely because it has an LED readout that makes me feel like I’m operating a mission control panel instead of just charging my AirPods.
I think this is the best deal of the day, and not just because it’s $17.99. It’s slim, light, and can survive a drop better than my will to stay off social media. Anker knows what it’s doing, and this charger just works. No random overheating, no mystery ports, just plug it in and keep scrolling through whatever app is currently ruining your sleep schedule.
Hulu + Live TVoffers a three-day free trialthat allows you to take the live TV streaming service for a spin. This is one of the overallbest streaming free trialsbecause it gets you a bundle of services. It is quite a bit shorter than the standard Hulu free trial of 30 days, but it's a great way to test it out over the weekend.
With a 240Hz refresh rate, Dual QHD resolution, and 0.03ms response time, this 49-inch ultrawide OLED is built for high-performance PC gaming. The 1800R curve and HDR True Black 400 make it incredibly immersive, while FreeSync Premium Pro helps keep gameplay smooth and responsive.
This Android tablet comes with an S Pen included, a 10.4-inch display, and Samsung DeX for multitasking. At under $200, it’s a solid pick for casual gamers, students, or anyone who wants a lightweight, entertainment-ready tablet with productivity perks.
Celebrate Women's History Month with a killer bundle featuring female-led games. Titles include Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, Control: Ultimate Edition,Darksiders III,Beyond: Two Souls, and more. It’s a $160+ value for just $12, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity.
With a whopping 10,000Pa of suction, self-refilling, self-emptying, sonic mopping, and even hot-air mop drying, the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra takes hands-off cleaning to the next level. It's packed with AI features and even supports pet tracking and video calls.
Amazon’s newest Kindleadds color to the mix with a 7"" Colorsoft display. It still lasts up to 8 weeks on a single charge and now supports wireless charging and full-color highlights. It's ideal for reading graphic novels, cookbooks, or anything where visuals matter.
Enjoy spatial audio, active noise canceling, and up to 40 hours of battery life. These over-ear headphones are compatible with both iOS and Android, and support lossless audio over USB-C. A strong option for commuters, creators, and music lovers.
This Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code ""IFPRZAZ"" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16"" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.
$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.
I think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.
If you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.
At $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.
$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.
This speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.
Crisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.
This speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.
Bass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.
XM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.
A wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.
My living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.
I didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.
This TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.
I want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.
This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.

"Finding a good deal on Apple products is rough, which is why I focused on all of these daily deals today. Finding multiple Apple deals, plus discounts on Zelda and Final Fantasy collectibles? It's my gamer-tech jackpot. Right now, you can save onAirPods Pro 2, grab aMagSafe leather case for just $11.99, and even score afour-pack of AirTags for under $70.

If you’re in the market forwireless earbuds,power adapters, or anApple Watchband, there are plenty of options at all-time low prices. And you know by now I like to pop in some really cool gaming stuff. How about a full-sizedMaster Sword replicathat plays Zelda music when you swing it and aFinal Fantasy I-VI bundlethat brings the pixel-perfect RPG classics back to life?
Upgrade your tech, complete your Zelda shrine, or relive Final Fantasy’s golden era, these deals are worth checking out. Some discounts like the iPhone 14 Plus MagSafe case, are downright ridiculous at 80% off. But Apple deals never last long (Tim Cook loves that Apple tax), and limited collectibles definitely sell out fast. If something catches your eye, now’s the time to add to cart before the price jumps back up.
AliExpress is offering this Arzopa 15"" 1080p USB Type-C portable monitor for only $57 shipped after you apply coupon code ""IFPQHLH"". We've posted deals on this portable monitor in the past, but this is the lowest price we've seen thus far. The marketplace vendor is Arzopa itself so you're getting the full manufacturer's warranty on this brand new, retail packaged item. This monitor is primarily designed to be a secondary display for a laptop, but the S1's 1080p 60Hz panel is a great match for the Nintendo Switch's hardware, since the Switch only supports up to 720p @ 60Hz anyway.
For only $22 more, you can upgrade to the higher end Arzopa Z1FC USB portable monitor, now only $79.19 after coupon code ""IFPQHLH"". It's currently $117 on Amazon. The Z1FC's upgrades include a larger display (16.1"" vs 15.6""), a higher refresh rate (144Hz vs. 60Hz), and better color reproduction (100% sRGB color gamut). This is a better monitor than the S1 to pair with the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally because both gaming handhelds can support refresh rates up to 144Hz.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.

If you’ve ever dreamed of wielding the Master Sword, this Tamashii Nations replica brings that dream to life. At 41.3 inches, it’s a full-sized, collector-worthy version of Link’s legendary blade. It’s not just for display either thanks to authentic sound effects and vibrations activate when you grip and swing it, making you feel like the true Hero of Hyrule.
The hilt features three buttons that play eight iconic songs from Zelda’s history, including themes from Ocarina of Time, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom. The sword comes with a sheath and display stand, so whether you want to show it off or take it into battle (against your furniture), it’s ready. At $200, this highly allocated collectible is bound to sell out fast.
A genuine Apple leather case for $11.99? That’s not a typo. It’s an 80% discount. Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.

Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.
Why buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.
If you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.
Still using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need.

"TheNvidia GeForce RTX 5090launched back in January and easily became the most powerfuldesktop graphics cardon the market. Now, a few months later, Nvidia has launched its Blackwell architecture for laptops, and while these mobileNvidia GPUsare nowhere near as powerful as their desktop counterparts, they do deliver an incredible gaming experience, especially on high-end gaming laptops with high-refresh displays.

However, just like Nvidia’s latest line of desktop graphics cards, the generational improvement in pure performance isn’t nearly as pronounced as it’s been in previous generations. That’s offset a bit in games that support features like Multi-Frame Generation, of course, but it does mean that anyone who already has a decent gaming laptop doesn’t need to sweat upgrading their setup for this new generation.
While the GPU in the Razer Blade 16 I tested is called an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, it’s a far cry from the desktop version of the GPU with the same name. Just by virtue of space and thermal constraints, the mobile version of the RTX 5090 needs to be much smaller: Instead of the 21,760 CUDA cores in the desktop version of the card, the mobile 5090 is limited to 10,496 cores across 82 Streaming Multiprocessors. That’s less than half the silicon, and places the RTX 5090 mobile closer to the desktop RTX 5080.
But it’s more than just the size of the chip – laptops are a lot more power-constrained than a desktop, too, by virtue of needing to operate on a battery or via a portable power brick. The system I tested the RTX 5090 Mobile with had the GPU limited to 160W, which is a little over aquarterof the power of its desktop counterpart. That has a huge impact on gaming performance, since a general rule of thumb is that more power = better performance.
However, compared to the previous-generation Razer Blade 16 with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, the new mobile chip has been beefed up a bit. The RTX 4090 packed 9,728 CUDA cores across 76 Streaming Multiprocessors, at the same 160W power budget. That’s about a 7.4% increase in the amount of cores, which is a minor increase, but it lines up extremely well with the performance increase you can expect from the RTX 5090.
Keep in mind, though, that with laptop graphics, it’s largely up to the laptop manufacturer how much power and cooling a GPU has access to. There may be some gaming laptops with an RTX 5090 configured to run with as little as 95W. The laptop I tested had it configured for 160W, which is above the maximum listed TGP (total graphics power) specified by Nvidia. The point is, your mileage may vary, as a 95W RTX 5090 is going to be much weaker than one running on 150W.
Each Streaming Multiprocessor is architected a bit differently than the RTX 4090 too. Just like the desktop version, the RTX 5090 Mobile is based on the new Blackwell architecture, which places special emphasis on AI computation – after all this is the same architecture powering most cutting-edge supercomputers right now. The new Tensor Cores, combined with a new AI Management Processor, or AMP, allow the GPU to do much more complex AI workloads, and is the driving force behind multi-frame generation.
Nvidia has also made an effort to improve battery life, which has never been a strong point for gaming laptops. It’s done this by improving Nvidia Optimus, a technology that dynamically switches between discrete and integrated graphics depending on what you’re doing. But Team Green has also implemented something called “Battery Boost”, which should improve gaming performance when you’re not plugged into the wall. Basically, Nvidia is using an algorithm to detect what’s going on in the game you’re playing and adjusting performance accordingly. For example, it’ll lower GPU clocks when you’re in a dialogue scene, and push more performance when you actually need it.
Just like its desktop counterpart, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 Mobile doesn’t have the strongest generational improvement over its predecessor. On average, I found that the RTX 5090 was about 8% faster than theRTX 4090. The performance gap was a bit better in workloads like 3DMark, but for the most part it doesn’t deliver much better gaming performance, at least before Frame Generation is brought into the equation.
To be clear, testing laptop graphics performance is a bit more complicated than testing a desktop graphics card, especially across generations. The Razer Blade 16 that Nvidia sent me for this architecture review is sporting an AMD Ryzen 9 AI HX 370, while the previous-gen Razer Blade 16 I used for testing the RTX 4090 has an Intel Core i9-13950HX – twoverydifferent processors. Plus, the chassis design has changed completely, and while we have a full review on the laptop coming later, the new design is much thinner and lighter, which calls into question thermal constraints.
However, throughout my testing, I didn’t notice the RTX 5090 being thermal- or power-limited in any way, even if the RTX 4090 was able to stretch a little above the 160W power limit – though not by much. So, while my initial results point to the RTX 5090 being on average 8% faster than the RTX 4090, there is enough variability here to take the numbers with a bit of a grain of salt. We’ll have a clearer picture of what this GPU can do as more laptop designs head to market over the next year or so.
In 3DMark, the new RTX 5090 Mobile was 12% faster than the RTX 4090 in Speed Way, and 16% faster in Steel Nomad. These are both DirectX 12 tests, and indicate potential performance more than anything.
When it comes to actual games, the performance differences are much less pronounced. For instance, inCall of Duty: Black Ops 6at 1600p, the RTX 5090 Mobile system got 107 fps, compared to 106 fps from the RTX 4090. That’s just a 1% improvement and totally within the margin of error.
Things look a little better inCyberpunk 2077,where the RTX 5090 Mobile manages 67 fps to the 4090’s 62 fps, making for an 8% improvement. That’s decent, and it’s important to note that this is without Frame Generation, which will further increase the 5090’s lead in frame rate.
I testedMetro Exodus: Enhanced Editionwith no upscaling, to give an idea of what to expect from pure ray tracing performance. In this game, the RTX 5090 gets 61 fps at 1600p with the Extreme Preset, compared to 56 fps from the RTX 4090, that’s a 9% improvement, lining up with the increase in CUDA cores almost exactly.
Red Dead Redemption 2is a weird case, as it puts the RTX 5090behindthe RTX 4090 at 1600p with DLSS set to Balanced. The newer GPU gets 89 fps, compared to 93 from the RTX 4090, which is about a 4% drop. However, this is likely due to the CPU not being able to keep up.
Total War: Warhammer 3 is a good way to gauge pure rasterization performance, as it eschews any ray tracing or upscaling technologies. In this game, the RTX 5090 is about 6% faster than the 4090. Though this may be another case where the CPU is holding the 5090 back.
In Assassins Creed Mirage, the GeForce RTX 5090 is able to soar with 107 fps at 1600p with everything maxed and with DLSS set to Balanced. However, that’s only 4% faster than the RTX 4090 with the same settings.
Then, in Black Myth: Wukong, a game that’s extremely GPU-heavy, the GeForce RTX 5090 gets 63 fps on average, which is only 5% faster than the 4090’s 60 fps average. This is one of the games that showed the strongest uplift for the RTX 5090 on desktop, so it's especially damning here.
Even for creators, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 for laptops isn’t a huge improvement. In Blender, the RTX 5090 Mobile is only 9% faster than the RTX 4090 in the Monster benchmark. Blender performance usually gets better over time, but it’s something to keep in mind.
The main reason the desktop version of the RTX 5090 had a large lead over its predecessor was because it had a much higher power budget – 575W vs 450W. With the RTX 5090 and RTX 4090 having the same 160W power limit, we see similar results to other RTX 5000 graphics cards. Chips like the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5080 had very modest improvements over their predecessors, which also had similar power requirements. At least when it comes to traditional gaming performance, Blackwell seems to be an architecture that is extremely dependent on power, so it shouldn’t be surprising that laptop performance doesn’t scale as well as Nvidia’s desktop cards.
The biggest difference between the RTX 5090 and its predecessor is DLSS 4, and specifically multi-frame generation, or MFG. DLSS 4 does also include improvements that are available on previous-generation GPUs, like moving AI upscaling from a convolutional neural network (CNN) to a Transformer network. This greatly improves accuracy and image quality, whether you’re using the RTX 5090 or an older RTX graphics card.
However, multi-frame generation really is the star of the show, particularly on the Razer Blade 16 with its 240Hz display.
Just like the previous version of frame generation that debuted with DLSS 3, MFG uses the Tensor Cores to generate frames between natively rendered frames. It then uses the new AI Management Processor to pace out the frames to minimize latency and other weirdness. Frame pacing is a task that has traditionally been handled by the CPU, so the AMP is especially needed to cut down on system latency when the GPU is magically creating three frames in between each rendered one.
For a high refresh display, though, this is an awesome feature. It doesn’t improve latency or anything, but it does make the gameplaylooka lot smoother, which is really all you need in single-player games like Assassins Creed Shadows. Just don’t expect it to magically improve your response times if you enable it in an online shooter likeMarvel RivalsorFragpunk.
Nvidia claims that MFG can triple frame rates, but it’s important to keep in mind that there’s a catch: you need to already have a good frame rate to get a good experience from frame generation. I wouldn’t recommend any kind of frame generation unless you’re already getting 50-60 fps without it. Below that, you’re basically asking for weird artifacts to show up as the algorithm struggles to track objects between frames.
If you do already have a good frame rate though, MFG really does boost frame rates by a huge margin, even if it does come with a slight cost to latency. For instance, in Cyberpunk 2077 with the Ray Tracing Overdrive preset and with DLSS set to balanced with no frame generation, the Razer Blade 16 managed an average of 51 fps at 1600p. That came with latency around 47ms, which isn’tgreat, but still more than playable. When I turned frame generation to 2x, that frame rate jumps all the way up to 96 fps, with the latency going up to 53ms. That’s a huge improvement to framerate, and the latency cost really isn’tthat high. The latency cost is a bit greater with MFG, as turning it up to 4x increases average latency to 59ms – though the framerate jumps to 170 fps.
It’s a similar story inStar Wars Outlaws. At 1600p with DLSS set to balanced, the RTX 5090 Mobile gets around 61 fps on average, with an average latency around 36ms. With 2x frame generation the frame rate goes up to 115 fps, with latency also increasing to 45ms. The jump up to 4x frame generation only brings the latency up to 48ms, but bumps the frame rate up to 210 fps, which is getting extremely close to the laptop’s native refresh rate of 240 Hz.
Realistically, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 is going to primarily be found in high-end gaming laptops with high resolution displays with high refresh rates. That’s exactly where multi frame generation shines, and it’s awesome to finally be able to take advantage of these super-fast laptop screens. Still, if you’re someone who is sensitive to latency or if you play competitive games, it might not be worth enabling.

If you already have a decent gaming laptop, you really shouldn’t look at the RTX 5090 twice. It doesn’t deliver much of an improvement over its last-generation counterpart, which remains excellent. However, if you’ve been waiting to upgrade to a high-end gaming laptop for a while, features like multi-frame generation and battery boost will make premium laptops powered by Nvidia’s latest even better."
"The total sales across theFinal Fantasy Pixel Remasterseries have topped 5 million copies worldwide, Square Enix has announced.

Taking toX/Twitter, Square Enix said Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster's success had pushed sales for the entire Final Fantasy series — that'sallFinal Fantasy games, not just the pixellated ones — up to a staggering 200 million copies.
Given Square Enix revealed Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster had reached three million copies sold in September 2023, that means the bundle has sold another two million copies in around 18 months.
Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster bundles together the first six Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster games as well as a 20-track soundtrack and 14 wallpapers.

"Gaming fans are feeling the heat after Nintendo announced itsSwitch 2 U.S. pre-order date was delayedas a direct result of the newly announced tariffs posed by the Trump Administration.

Wednesday morning, Nintendo fully unveiled its hybrid console sequel alongside plans to open pre-orders come April 9 — news thatDonald Trump would soon implement sweeping tariffs across the globearrived just hours later. It was a moment of whiplash that the industry is still struggling to come to grips with, and now, two days later, the average gaming fan is already feeling the impact.
“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,” Nintendo said in a statement shared with IGN. “Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”
I really hate being right. I kept telling folks that things can literally change tomorrow. People kept yelling at me that the tariffs won't affect us...aight man 😒
46% tariff on Vietnamese imports announced now.Nintendo Switch 2 are produced there…It’s so fucking over.pic.twitter.com/5N1iAMI2Jm
they’re gonna make it even more expensivepic.twitter.com/5Y8FL9FZF6
“Wait a minute… are you sayingwehave to pay the tariffs??” oneReddit user commented. “Who could have possibly foreseen this?!”
While pre-order timing for other territories, including the UK, remains unchanged, Nintendo didn’t mince words when it came to how tariffs will affect those in the United States. However, changes to a release schedule, even when it comes to something as simple as pre-order timing, signal that Nintendo has more on its mind than it has revealed thus far.
There were fears that Nintendo’s proposed $450 Switch 2 price and$80 gamesmight be too big of an ask pre-tariffs — amovement aiming to get Nintendo to lower its price plansalready began shortly after that initial reveal — but the struggle for affordable games is just getting started. While someanalysts had suggestedSwitch 2 prices were calculated with potential tariffs in mind, Nintendo’s announcement today suggests those numbers have room to increase.
So thenThose WERE the pre tariff pricesYeah the Switch and Mario Kart bout to be 650 after taxes
Americans checking the updated Switch 2 prices after complaining about the old oneshttps://t.co/fsC60LU5YEpic.twitter.com/t4RwqXia8J
Nintendo hasn’t announced when or if its Switch 2 prices will change, but there is plenty of reason to worry they will shift in a more expensive direction. What began as a wave of frustration aimed at the current Switch 2 price has now evolved into an ocean of people who, of course, are still angry, but now they are just hoping they’ll be able to afford the new console.
“This unironically frustrates me so much,” anotherReddit user added. “The switch 2 was already going to be quite expensive (compared to the OG) but I was still okay with paying the extra money for it. The games were another blow. Was too expensive already but whatever. But this? Huge tariffsPlus Sales taxPlus tariffs on the games???
“I don’t want to pay 130$ for a damn copy of a game or 600$ for the new Switch. I genuinely (think) this will impact the amount of people able to buy into all of this. I shouldn’t as an average person be priced out of this, yet I probably will be. Augh…”
I feel bad for all my US followers. If you thought the Switch 2 price was expensive before. It looks like its going to get even worse due to new tariffs.
We'vespoken to other industry analystswho acknowledge that these unprecedented tariffs have gamers and game-makers walking into uncharted territory and that there's no telling what exactly will happen with the Switch 2. While some believe we could soon see a price increase, others aren't so sure, but all agree that the industry will no doubt feel the impact of the Trump Administration's wide-reaching tariff plans.
The Switch 2 is Nintendo’s latest groundbreaking console, but a suddenly increased price could be just the start of what’s to come. Wespoke with Entertainment Software Association (ESA) spokesperson Aubrey Quinn to learn more about how Trump’s unprecedented tariffs will impact video game fans moving forward. As many have already feared, the ESA says there’s no reason to believe the damage will stop at Nintendo.
It does not stop at Nintendo Switch 2 btw.-PC parts like CPU's and GPU's are gonna go up-Laptops going up-Anything Tech related is going up.Next PlayStation and Xbox gonna require a blood sacrifice.
The prices of your consoles, tech, and pretty much every daily necessity are about to go up.There's a good chance Nintendo is about to announce a price hike for the Switch 2. Do not be surprised if Sony and Microsoft follow suit.PC market is already screwed.https://t.co/M40UFMyRH5

"Activision has detailed its ongoing anti-cheat work ahead of the launch of Season 3 inCall of Duty: Black Ops 6andWarzone, and confirmed something pretty much all Call of Duty players had assumed to be true.

The mega publisher has spent millions of dollars developing its anti-cheat technology as well as pursuing cheat makers in the courts, witha number of recent high-profile successes. Earlier in March,Phantom Overlay announced it was shutting down, with fans reacting in disbelief that such a prominent Call of Duty cheat provider would fall by the wayside. And just last week,IGN reported on four cheat providers that were shut downahead of next week’shotly anticipated return of Verdansk to Warzone.
In a newblog post, Activision said its plan has been “to go on the offensive and disrupt the cheating marketplace,” and as part of that it had shut down over 20 cheat makers and dozens of cheat resellers.
Team RICOCHET, the part of Activision dedicated to anti-cheat in Call of Duty, has issued over 228,000 bans since Black Ops 6 was released. Activision claimed it removed 23% of cheaters before they even played their first match.
“These are strong wins for the game, but there’s always more we can do to get better in both speed and efficiency,” Activision said.
Season 3 brings with it new anti-cheat systems, although Activision said it didn’t want to give away details for “security reasons.”
“Several of our current systems are getting big updates this season, too, including our aim bot detections and the Machine Learning system that analyzes game replays to identify suspicious gameplay for manual enforcement,” Activision continued.
The company then went on to address inaccurate in-game player reports in situations where the killing player might have had an intel advantage, such as when using Perks like Recon Scout or when having the advantage of a Spy Cam live ping.
“Over 60% of received cheater reporting in Warzone have been against console players, for example,” Activision explained. “Console cheating is possible, but our data has consistently shown it represents an extremely low population of detected cheaters when compared to PC, which means that this large volume of cheater reports are inaccurate even if the KillCams may have made it seem like the player was cheating.”
As a result, Activision is updating the KillCam “to help demystify gunfights and increase the accuracy of player reports.”
• List of attackers who dealt damage with their username, weapon, damage, and hits
• Affected by Live Ping: If the enemy had you pinged via line-of-sight
• Affected by UAV: If the enemy had you pinged on the minimap via UAV, UAV Tower, or Advanced UAV
• Affected by Unsuppressed Weapon: When firing your weapon revealed your location on the minimap to nearby enemies
During the upcoming Season, this widget will get more updates to callout even more gameplay elements like equipment, killstreaks, field upgrades, contracts, perks, and more to help players report with greater accuracy and confidence, Activision said.
Crucially, Activision is also making changes to ranked play. In Season 3, a new system will reverse the impact a banned cheater had on the Ranked Play SR system:
• When a Ranked Play cheater is banned, anyone they've recently defeated in Ranked Play will receive a SR Refund for those matches (to start, we will examine the last two weeks of matches but will continue to monitor if this timing needs to be adjusted)
• Players who we detect playing with cheaters may have SR for those wins taken away
This process will be live for Black Ops 6 Ranked Play shortly after Season 03's launch and a similar system will arrive for Warzone when Ranked Play is live. Activision will also perform a leaderboard scrub before Season 02 ends to remove any account that earned SR illegitimately, such as from boosting.
The apparent prevalence of cheaters is considered by some to be ruining competitive multiplayer, and Activision had come under fire for failing to address the problem. Things got so bad that with the release of Season 2,Activision let console Ranked players disable crossplay with PC players.
Cheating is not unique to Call of Duty, of course, but it has become more problematic for Activision since it released free-to-download battle royale Warzone back in 2020. The hope among players is when Verdansk goes live in Warzone on April 3 alongside Season 3, cheating won't be quite as big a problem as it once was.

"Atomfalllooks like a hit, with 1.5 million players reached and, ahem, 300,000 cups of tea drank.

Rebellion’s brand new IP set in the north of England is the company’s most successful launch in its 32-year history, it said. Rebellion is the developer behind the popular Sniper Elite series of games, as well as the spin-off Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army entries.
Here's the official blurb:
“We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall,” said Jason Kingsley CBE, CEO and co-founder of Rebellion.
“To have surpassed the 1 million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off.
“We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series.
“We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game.”
While Atomfall launched simultaneously across PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series X and S and Xbox One,it also released on Game Pass as a day-one title, which will have significantly boosted player numbers.
Rebellion did not say how many copies of the game were sold, however, preferring, like Assassin’s Creed Shadows maker Ubisoft, to go down the player number route. But it did provide some fun stats to back up it announcement.
Over 316,000 Atomfall players, for example, have killed the scientist at the very beginning of the game. In total there have been over 3.7 million kills using the cricket bat, while over 4 million pasties and 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed.
IGN'sAtomfall reviewreturned an 8/10. We said: ""Atomfall is a compelling, post-apocalyptic survival story that satisfyingly bends to your choices and discoveries no matter which direction you take.""

"They compete closely on price and specs, but Nintendo still owns the mass market
byOli Welsh
When Nintendo launched the Switch in 2017, it had no competition in dedicated handheld gaming, a sector it had established with the Game Boy in 1989 and ruled ever since. Sega had come and gone; Sony, after two determined attempts with the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita, had just about given up.
As Switch 2 nears launch in 2025, things look a little different — but only a little. The colossal success of the Switch has awoken the slumbering giants. Sony and Microsoft are now reportedly preparingdedicated PlayStationandXbox handhelds. Improbably, though, it was the PC gaming sphere that made the first move. Valve led the way with the Steam Deck in 2022, which swiftly seeded a growing ecosystem of similar, PC-based handheld devices from manufacturers like Lenovo and Asus. After a quiet decade, non-Nintendo handheld gaming is a thing again. And that means the Switch 2 will not run unopposed for handheld gaming supremacy.
In a sense, Nintendo is the victim of its own strategic foresight. With the Switch, it was the first to spot that the narrowing gap in processing power between mobile and at-home devices had enabled a unification of handheld and home gaming experiences. Finally, the same games could work in both contexts. The Switch proved this point emphatically, and now everyone wants a piece.
But with dedicated devices from Sony and Microsoft still years away, for now that competition must come from Steam Deck and the other PC handhelds. My colleague Chris Plante persuasively argued that these devices representNintendo’s “biggest threat in the present.”They trounce the Switch on specs and have closed the gap to contemporary AAA gaming in the home until it’s almost imperceptible. Software-wise, they offer the compelling value and staggering range of just about everything on Steam — and much of PC gaming beyond it, if you’re prepared to fiddle about a bit.
It’s true that the Switch 2’s price and specs put it into direct competition with the lower-end PC handhelds. At $449, it’s $50 more expensive than the base model Steam Deck. The Switch 2 isroughly comparable in power and storage, has a much better screen, and with detachable controllers and a TV dock included in the price, it’s much more flexible to use. The base model of Asus’ ROG Ally handheld ($499 or thereabouts) and the new Lenovo Legion Go S ($549) are also pretty close competitors in terms of specs.
In raw hardware terms, these are all very similar devices. It’s worth noting that the Switch 2’sexclusive accesstoNvidia’s market-leading DLSS upscaling technologyshould allow it to punch a bit above its weight class. But realistically, there’s not much between them.
But — and it’s a very, very big but — comparing the Switch 2 to the PC handhelds by running your finger down a spec sheet, or by noting that they can all playCivilization 7andElden Ring, does not tell the whole story. Within an enthusiast bubble, PC handhelds are a big deal, but they do not exist in the same universe as Nintendo consoles. To put it bluntly, PC handhelds are still niche.
The Steam Deck has been a big success for Valve, but let’s put it in perspective. Valve has not discussed sales numbers, but market research estimates thatit has sold around 4 million Steam Decks. And Steam Deck dwarfs its competition; the same research suggests that, in total, around 6 million PC handhelds have been sold in the three years since the Steam Deck went on the market. Worryingly, there aren’t yet signs of strong growth in sales.
Stack that up against the Switch’s 150 million units sold and the wild difference in scale becomes evident. Of course, it isn’t a directly analogous comparison. PC handhelds have only existed for three years; the Switch has been around for eight years, and Nintendo has been in the handhelds business for more than 35 years. All the same, Nintendo predicts it will sell11 million units of the aging Switchin its current fiscal year — more than five times the predicted sales of PC handhelds in that time. Meanwhile, analysts reckon that theSwitch 2 will, on its own, outstrip the size of the PC handheld marketalmost immediately, with 6 to 8 million units available at launch, and up to 20 million sales in its first year.
Valve is a big player in the game industry, and a very rich company. But it is a newcomer to the world of consumer electronics retail, and it has a lot of catching up to do — if it’s even interested in doing it. Steam Deck isn’t available to purchase in stores; you can’t walk into Walmart and pick one up. Valve is not buying ads for it on TV or at bus stops. Companies like Lenovo and Asus have more traditional distribution channels, but they’re tiny minnows compared to the marketing, retail, and distribution might of Nintendo.
There are other factors that make the PC handhelds niche products. The user experience of Windows-based handhelds like the ROG Ally and Legion Go is notoriously bad. Valve’s SteamOS is much better, but it is still quite far removed from the reliability and simplicity offered by Nintendo and the other console platforms.
You cannot unbox a new Steam Deck, turn it on, and play a game straight away. It requires tinkering to get the best out of. Although Valve’s verification system for games is a helpful guide, it’s not guaranteed you’ll get a good, playable experience on every game. The Deck is also bulky and heavy. You would never buy one for a child, or share one within a family — it’s clearly not designed to be shared. Realistically, it remains a tough sell for anyone who isn’t a gaming hobbyist.
There is, reportedly, one upcoming device that may be able to change this narrative a little. Microsoft is said to be working with a PC handheld manufacturer ona system that will have Xbox brandingand a user interface based on a new version of the Xbox PC app. This has the potential to be a more user-friendly device that offers easy access to PC Game Pass on the go, which would be quite compelling. But, although Microsoft has now been making Xbox consoles for over 20 years, it hasconsistently struggledto use that experience to make PC gaming more seamless, despite repeated attempts — and the device doesn’t sound like much more than a stopgap until Microsoft’s own dedicated handheld console is ready.
Nintendo will not have true competition in handhelds until its peers in the console space get involved. Microsoft is reportedly eyeing 2027 for the release of its handheld Xbox. Sony’s portable PS5 is also said to be years away, if it’s ever released. Things are definitely heating up for Nintendo, and by the end (or even the middle) of the Switch 2’s life, the handheld gaming market is sure to be much busier than it is now. But for the next few years, competition for the new console will remain distant — at best.

"Schedule 1 is currently hovering near the top of the Steam charts
byCass Marshall
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
There’s something wrong with this town; it’s immediately apparent as soon as I arrive. I’ve recently fled my humble desert hometown after my uncle was raided by the cops and his criminal enterprise was seized. I’m working on rebuilding the empire here in the sleepy town of Hyland Point, but there are a few problems to deal with. First of all, I need to learn the ropes of how to grow weed, cook meth, and maintain a customer base. Secondly, a rival criminal organization firebombed my RV. Finally, the cops remain a constant hassle. That’s just life inSchedule 1, a surprisingly expansive drug dealing simulator with some wacky twists, all created by a solo developer.
Schedule 1has risen through the Steam ranks and maintains popularity because it has a really satisfying core gameplay loop. Much likePalworld, the first big surprise hit of 2024,Schedule 1liberally borrows from other simulator games and different genres. I can play single-player, in which case I handle every element of the operation: growing, packaging, selling, expanding. Or I can rope in up to three friends and we can each handle part of the business.
Every part of theSchedule 1drug empire is built around a minigame, most of which are satisfying. For instance, I don’t particularly care for cooking meth, but I find managing the supply chain to be satisfying. If I run into any downtime during gameplay, no worries — I stole a TV from my motel room and it has some minigames on it, likeSnake,Pong, or a game where I play an egg in sunglasses with his balls hanging out. Nowthisis gaming.
Early on, the main obstacle I have to worry about is the police. Occasionally, an officer will search me, looking for anything illegal. They set up blockades between neighborhoods, demanding to search my vehicle if I hit one. The cops are barely a problem for me, though; I have a 100% success rate at just sprinting away from them at top speed. Even if I shoot an officer, they’ll forget everything after a couple of minutes. Weirdly enough, the thing they are firmest on is the town curfew. After 6 p.m., everyone has to get inside, or risk being arrested. I’ve found myself hiding in a bush or scared off my patio by a police patrol, who treat curfew-breaking as the worst possible sin. It’s like living in a weirdFootloosetown, except everyone’s constantly smoking a joint.
Life in Hyland Point feels like a very simplified take on the Grand Theft Auto franchise, complete with crass jokes. For instance, a local dining establishment across from my starting motel room is called Taco Ticklers. One customer is tragically dubbed “Peter File.” These jokes are so unsophisticated, they’re single entendres. If you’re not a fan of cheap, lazy jokes, then you’ll likely find yourself irritated bySchedule 1. The other night, I buckled down to experiment with mixing variants and creating new weed strains, most of which had names like “Big Cum” or “Magic AssBlaster.” The graphics are similarly simplified and cartoony, like a basic claymation setup or a 3D episode ofSouth Park.
A lot of work has gone into designing the steps of creating drugs viaSchedule 1’s minigames, but an opening screen warns me that none of it is accurate to real-world processes. Regardless, it’s satisfying to tinker in my workshop, creating weed with incredible new properties. Eventually, I become a living god in Hyland Point, and my disciples are smoking the dankest blunts imaginable. Some let me sprint faster than any car, and one strain variable even lets me fly. I can buy cars from the local auto dealership, but there’s not much point when I have a pocketful of magic weed.
Much like the aforementionedPalworld, I think this game will eventually become stale and I’ll put it back on the shelf.Schedule 1is an early access game that just came out, and so there are things that just feel incomplete. The police are toothless, the rival syndicate who blew up my RV in the start of the game has yet to reemerge, and the developer maintains a Trello that lists potential ideas ranging from “sewer network” to “weather” to “cartel fighting.”
I suspect I’ll find myself returning toSchedule 1as it receives patches, since the core gameplay is so satisfying. While my co-op server has gotten relatively far into creating illicit substances like high-end meth and cocaine, my solo game has stalled as I save up enough money for a larger property. Eventually, I’ll have conquered everything Hyland Point has to offer. For now, I’m just enjoying the ride, and I expect that trip will only grow richer in time.
Schedule 1is available on Steam for $20, and there’s a demo available for free. I’ll continue to follow its developer, who goes by Tyler’s Video Game Studio, as this game already has a lot of strengths. Even if the novelty will eventually wear off, I’m content for now to let Tyler cook.
Schedule 1was released March 24 in early access on Windows PC. The game was reviewed on PC using a download code purchased by the author. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

"The Switch 2 is a souped-up handheld gaming PC in Nintendo clothes
byCameron Faulkner
A custom Nvidia processor is at the heart of theNintendo Switch 2, giving it power to push up to 120 frames per second in handheld mode, or up to 4K at 60 frames per second while docked.
While Nintendo has been cagey to share more details on its partnership with the graphics and AI giant, Nvidia published ashort press releaseconfirming the collaboration — and diving a little more deeply into the tech found in Nintendo’s surprisingly capable handheld.
It name-dropped a lot of features that are commonly tossed around in the world of PC gaming. For one, the Switch 2’s 7.9-inch 1080p LCD display has G-Sync support baked in, and its variable refresh rate (VRR) support will ensure that you won’t notice fluctuations in frame rate as easily. Nvidia shared that the Switch 2 has “10x the graphical performance of the Nintendo Switch,” and that it uses DLSS to upscale graphics in games. Also, developers will be able to take advantage of ray tracing in the Switch 2.
Additionally, Nvidia’s tech supports other tentpole features of the Switch 2, includingGameChat. Nvidia’s AI Tensor Cores are used to focus on face tracking while removing the background (giving that green screen streamer look).
“With 1,000 engineer-years of effort across every element — from system and chip design to a custom GPU, APIs and world-class development tools — the Nintendo Switch 2 brings major upgrades,” says Nvidia’s press release.

"We played Metroid Prime 4 with a Joy-Con mouse. Here’s what that’s like
byChelsea Stark
We played Metroid Prime 4 with a Joy-Con mouse. Here’s what that’s like
byChelsea Stark
Nintendo announced that its Switch 2 Joy-Cons could beused as a mouse— in either hand, even — during itsSwitch 2 Directon April 2. Mice and other pointers have been aiding in making certain game movements more precise for decades, so the idea of a console-based mouse is tempting, if it’s implemented well.
During a hands-on event in New York City on Wednesday, I was able to test the Joy-Cons’ mouse mode on a few different gameplay experiences specifically designed to highlight it. Nintendo is a company known for unique (or sometimes gimmicky) implementations of control schemes, yet the mouse has had decades of refinement for computer gaming. Some of the experiences I had using the Joy-Con as a mouse felt traditional, but some left me scratching my head as to whether they would receive wider adoption.
The new Joy-Con — called Joy-Con 2 — has been given extra heft and sturdiness compared to the first iteration. They fill my hands a bit more comfortably without being too much wider. When I’m sliding them on their sides, it doesn’t seem like they will accidentally tip over. I found that the mouse could also register on different types of surfaces; while Nintendo provided nice, cushy, desk-sized mouse pads to use during demos, I also triedsliding the mouse up and down my corduroy pantsto simulate “gamer conditions” of playing in the wild. There really wasn’t too much of a difference, as long as the surface was wide enough to handle a mouse swipe.
For a demo ofMetroid Prime 4:Beyond, I used the mouse (while standing at a desk, which felt slightly awkward!) to gun down enemies. The movement felt mostly comparable to that of any first-person shooter I’ve played on a computer — although in PC games, mouse controls aren’t usually paired with the lock-on technology Samus still uses inBeyond. But it did feel fairly natural to aim and look around with the Joy-Con mouse. This was slightly complicated by the fact that the face buttons were now rotated, so finding the right one was less intuitive while trying to scan doors, fire missiles, or activate Samus’ morph ball mode. I felt like I was constantly hitting the wrong button during my demo because of the adjustment.
The end of theMetroid Prime 4demo featured a boss covered in glowing weak spots for which I couldn’t use the auto lock-on, meaning I had to rely on the mouse’s precision aiming — or lack thereof, due to the removal of lock-on mechanics — to take it down. I wonder how much this will feature in the full game, and if the Switch 2 version of the game will highlight the mouse more than the Switch version.
Meanwhile, inDrag x Drive, using the Joy-Con as a mouse was less about aiming and precision and more about endlessly sliding it. In a game that feels meant to highlight Switch 2 features rather than be fun, I was endlessly swiping with both hands to build speed as a little robot wheelchair user, then swiping one or the other Joy-Con mouse to turn. The idea is easy to understand, but despite it feeling like a smaller-scale version of rowing, I struggled for a bit to figure out how to move smoothly. Thankfully, throwing passes to my teammates or making baskets felt very generous, because most of my time withDrag x Drivewas spent just on mastering movement. It’s hard for me to envision setting this game up in a room with the amount of space I might need for the mouse movements, even if I could use my legs instead of a flat surface.
I’m so curious to see this concept extended to other games beyond these demos, as a mouse has so much potential for console gaming. But it might require dedicated resources for developers to figure out how to best implement the Switch 2’s mouse functionality — it’s really not like anything else out there, since it can work in either (or even both) of the user’s hands but will still need to accommodate button presses on the Joy-Con as well.

"Why Nintendo wants Madden and Borderlands on its new handheld
byChris Plante
Nintendo took an unusual approach to the past two decades of video game console wars. It stayed out of them. But with today’sNintendo Switch 2 info dump— packed with big-name third-party games rarely seen onNintendo hardware— the House that Mario Built appears ready to rejoin the fray. Why now? Credit a collision of confidence, opportunity, and necessity.
Sony and Microsoft have spent generations bloodying each other in a battle for the most extravagant visuals, courting favor with major publishers like Activision and Electronic Arts. Meanwhile, Nintendo swam in the opposite direction, favoring cheaper, less powerful machines that prioritized toy-like novelty over raw specs.
The historic successes of both the Wii and the Switch obscure how risky this gamble has been. The slower hardware — with a few, better-forgotten exceptions — couldn’t run the latest entries in gaming’s most popular franchises, including Madden, Call of Duty, and Grand Theft Auto. Survival hinged on Nintendo’s ability to produce multiple exclusive hits each year, with smaller indie titles filling the gaps.
With the Switch, everything went Nintendo’s way — by both design and good fortune. The publisher assembled arguably the greatest first-party lineup in history. Indie development exploded. And a new wave of beloved IP —Minecraft,Fortnite, Roblox — designed for smartphone-level specs meant that Nintendo’s hardware, unintentionally, could play some of the biggest games on the planet.
And yet, today, Nintendo’s hourlongSwitch 2reveal stream featured anabundance of titlesonce rare on its systems. 2K Games showed off new entries in the WWE, Civilization, and Borderlands franchises. Other developers, like IO Interactive, pledged to bring hits once best experienced on Xbox or PlayStation, like Hitman and the upcomingProject 007. Square Enix showed theremakes ofFinal Fantasy 7, and EA appeared, committing EA Sports FC and Madden to the platform.
It’s possible that coming off the success of the Switch — a far cry from Nintendo’s grim posture after the Wii U — the gamemaker feels positioned to push into the third-party territory ceded to Sony and Microsoft, the latter of which seems to be clinging to its hardware business by its fingertips. After all, Nintendo has sold over 150 million Switch consoles — more than the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S combined.
It’s also possible a mix of luck and industry trends will once again favor Nintendo. Sony and Microsoft’s reluctance to fully leave the PS4 and Xbox One era behind — coupled with a generation raised on mobile gaming — has trained AAA developers to build for underpowered hardware. TheSwitch 2will still trail behind top-tier machines in horsepower, but that may no longer matter. Most major franchises simply don’t demand cutting-edge specs.
Both of those are likely a piece of the puzzle. But I believe Nintendo’s decision to release amore expensiveand slightly morepowerful devicemay have less to do with past console wars and more to do with its biggest threat in the present. In 2025, Valve’s Steam Deck does what the Switch doesn’t: It lets players enjoy most AAA games anytime, anywhere — and offers many of the same indie titles at steep discounts. (That it also runs emulated games from every Nintendo console ever released surely isn’t lost on the company either, as it continues its crackdown on third-party emulation.)
If Nintendo once again ignores third parties and their graphical needs, it would find itself competing against a growing number of handhelds that offer more power and more games, often with better specs — albeit higher prices.
Inexplicably, Microsoft and Sony burned an entire hardware cycle without answering the Switch’s key selling point: portability. It took a PC gaming marketplace — with almost no hardware pedigree — to offer legitimate competition. And Nintendo, with the Switch 2’s higher price, greater power, and suite of PC-like social features, seems to be taking the threat seriously.
Yes, Nintendo has reentered the modern console wars. Maybe, one day, Sony and Microsoft will too.

"It’s-a me, economic anxiety over inflation and US tariffs
byChristopher Grant
January’s Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event took the wraps off the console, but left a lot of details unanswereduntil now. After the initial reveal, I put togetheran analysis of the possible pricingfor the console, using Nintendo’s own historical pricing strategies to guide my thinking. My conclusion then was that it would cost $399.
I…was wrong. The Nintendo Switch 2 will debut in Junestarting at $449.99, with a $499.99 version that includesMario Kart World.
At that price, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be the most expensive console Nintendo has ever released, by some margin. And even adjusted for inflation, and when considering the various bundle packages of previous Nintendo consoles, the Nintendo Switch 2 will still be the most expensive Nintendo console ever made!
It’s not quite June yet, so I can’t update this chart to reflect the inflation-adjusted price to the same date of the Switch 2 launch, but the prices from February of this year are pretty illustrative of the change here.
[Ed. note:An earlier version of this list didn’t include information on pack-in games included in some console releases, and didn’t include the various NES bundles and prices. Adjusted for inflation, only the very first NES release — a tricked-out bundle originally limited to test markets only — would be more expensive than the Nintendo Switch 2. Once you compare it to the more widely released Control Deck release just a few months later, the relative cost of the Nintendo Switch 2 is clear.]
But it wasn’t just me that was wrong! Nearly 57% of ourpoll respondents agreedwith my predicted $399 price, and just 9% thought it would come in at $449. (If that was you, congratulations!) Is that indicative that Nintendo will have a hard time moving units at $449, or simply that people didn’t think Nintendo would go that high? It’s too early to say.
Earlier reporting from Bloomberg, citing multiple industry analysts, pegged the pricebetween $399 and $499, so… nailed it?
On price, the analysts Bloomberg spoke to are unanimous in expecting the Switch 2 to cost at least $399 — which, again, agrees with Polygon’s own analysis. Some think it could go higher, to $449 or even $499, driven by the cost of components and fears over the impact of U.S. tariffs. At $499 it would be the same price as a PlayStation 5 (and $50 more than a digital-only model).
Here again is a list of all of the current-gen consoles, now including the Switch 2 and its confirmed pricing:
At $449, the Switch 2 will go toe to toe on pricing with the all-digital variants of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, which is in keeping with the Switch’s 2017 launch price that matched the $299 being asked for the PS4 Slim and Xbox One S. It’s worth noting, however, that $299 in 2017 dollars still comes in under $400 in today’s bucks, when adjusted for inflation. It’s not just you — everything really is just more expensive!
One last consideration: While the Switch 2’s specs actually put it a notch above the Steam Deck in some key categories, like resolution and including a 4K-compatible dock out of the box, I didn’t expect Valve’s portable gaming PC to beat Nintendo on pricing. The Steam Deck APU is going on three years old at this point, and a little long in the tooth, but it’s hard to argue against the value embedded in Valve’s storefront. (I boughtUndertalefor $1 recently just to have another copy.) So with Valve continuing to make a name for itself, and with Microsoftreportedly entering the portable gaming spacethis year in partnership with Asus, Nintendo no longer has the exclusive lock on the portable gaming market.
Update: I updated the headline and some of the opening paragraphs, along with the first pricing comparison chart, to reflect that when evaluated on a more like-to-like basis the Nintendo Switch 2, with and without a pack-in game, is in fact the most expensive Nintendo console ever released, when adjusted for inflation.

"Rejoice, for it has become a reliable monthly supplier of original AA games
byOli Welsh
The end of 2024 was a huge moment for Microsoft’sGame Passsubscription service. Theday-one arrival ofCall of Duty: Black Ops 6, the biggest possible blockbuster to add, felt like the climactic endpoint of Microsoft’s $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. And it was swiftly followed by another huge Microsoft release: Bethesda’sIndiana Jones and the Great Circle, an improbably great licensed romp starring a genuine pop culture icon.
The early months of 2025 haven’t seen such splashy day-one exclusives on Game Pass, and won’t untilDoom: The Dark Agesarrives on May 15. And yet this period has been just as consequential for Game Pass; it has, if anything, done even more to demonstrate the value of a Game Pass subscription. The service is finally delivering something Microsoft has always intended it would: a steady, reliable stream of brand new games you actually want to play.
It started in January, with the surprise release of theNinja Gaiden 2 Blackremaster, the sleeper fantasy adventureEternal Strands, anddependable Nazi assassination simSniper Elite Resistance. In February, there was Obsidian’sAvowed, perhaps the ultimate Game Pass release — a manageable, moreish, and colorful role-playing game. Now we haveAtomfall, completing an endearingly janky one-two punch from Sniper Elite developer Rebellion. The pace is not about to let up. On April 8, there’s Compulsion Games’South of Midnight. On April 24, the delightfully French turn-based RPGClair Obscur: Expedition 33.
Amongst all these titles there have been a smattering of must-play indie games, likeLonely Mountains: Snow Riders,Citizen Sleeper 2, and the upcomingBlue Prince. There have also been some worthwhile back catalog drops of varying vintage, fromthe firstDiablo, throughWatch Dogs: LegionandWarhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, to the now-ubiquitousBalatro.
These games are all great additions, but they are not the headline. What’s really striking when you look at this release schedule is the steady cadence of brand-new, mid-size, single-player adventures: the kind of game you can gorge yourself on for a couple of weeks and then move on, happy and satiated. From January through toDoom: The Dark Agesin May, Game Pass is serving up at least one of these games every month on day one — and sometimes two or three. It’s also notable that many of them —Eternal Strands,Avowed,Atomfall,South of Midnight,Clair Obscur— are originals. Rejoice, for in the year 2025, Game Pass has become a reliable monthly supplier of a kind of entertainment that was on the verge of extinction: original AA games.
With all those new COD and Indy subscribers hanging around, the timing could not have been better. Game Pass has long represented good value. Microsoft has kept the service’s catalog well stocked since its early days, and simply having access to every first-party game on day one — even before that lineup included Bethesda and Activision Blizzard titles — was always a compelling reason to subscribe. But the rate at which substantial new games would be added to the service was erratic, to say the least. Now, it’s a smooth conveyor belt. That success is just as attributable to smart partnerships with independent studios like Rebellion and smaller publishers likeClair Obscur’s Kepler Interactive as it is to Microsoft’s newfound publishing might.
There are a couple of important caveats to bear in mind. The first is that, since Microsoftrejigged the structure of Game Passlast year, this judgment only really applies to the Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass tiers, where day-one games live. Game Pass Ultimate isn’t cheap, but with EA Play and cloud gaming included, it’s still good value. PC Game Pass is a stone-cold bargain.
The second, much more significant caveat is: I have no idea if any of this is working out financially for Microsoft or for its partners. This has been true since the inception of Game Pass, and even more so since Microsoft stopped reporting subscriber numbers. The cost of rolling up all these day-one games in funding deals, internal licensing, and cannibalization of game sales, must be huge. And that’s before you even factor in the incalculable cost of the acquisition spree that saw Microsoft snap up studios likeAvowed’s Obsidian Entertainment andSouth of Midnight’s Compulsion Games, not to mention the even pricier purchases of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard.
But if there was ever any doubt that Game Pass made sense for gamers — at least, gamers of the kind that like to play through a new single-player adventure every month — that doubt has now been dispelled. Game Pass is not just creating happy customers, it’s making a big contribution to keeping a rickety sector of the industry and artform of video games alive. Here’s hoping this is sustainable, and as good of a deal for the makers of these games as it is for the people playing them.

"Feels good to win one, eh?

Ubisoft’s official X account for the Assassin’s Creed series popped off Tuesday afternoon as the massive franchise responded to offhand criticism from Elon Musk. The reply was a roast for the ages.

Kern posted the screenshot, taken from a Bluesky account that automatically reposts Piker’s tweets, with his commentary: “You can tell a lot about Ubisoft @Ubisoft with how much money they are throwing at terrorist-platforming streamers.” Musk responded twice: first, “Hasan is a fraud,” then, “‘Sell-out’ would be more accurate. Objectively, he is promoting a terrible game just for the money.”
Cue the legendary response from the official Assassin’s Creed account: “Is that what the guy playing your Path of Exile 2 account told you?”
The account is referencing thewidespread beliefthat Musk’s ostensibly excellent performance in several video games is due to him paying skilled gamers to boost his account while he works on dismantling the U.S. government in the background. This became a rumor after Musk claimed he hasone of the most powerfulPath of Exile 2charactersin the world, thenstreamed himself playing like a noobdespite having god-tier gear that takes hundreds of hours, or superb gameplay, to acquire. Later,YouTuber NikoWrexposted a video that seemingly shows his DMs on X with Elon Musk. The video shows messages from Musk’s account that say the best players in Diablo and Path of Exile games “require multiple people playing the account to win a leveling race.” When NikoWrex asked whether he’s level-boosted inPath of Exile 2orDiablo 4, the Musk account responded with a “100” emoji.
Clearly, the Assassin’s Creed team is not hiding in the shadows like the game’s characters. Kern responded to the fiery takedown — which got about 20 times the number of likes as Musk’s most-liked reply — with a screenshot of aPCGamesN storyreporting onShadows’ sales numbers. (Kern made sure to omit the outlet’s name in his screenshot — another practiceMusk has been bodied for on social media.) “Our game is out,” the Assassin’s Creed X account responded, undoubtedly poking fun atKern for his in-progress, unreleased gamefor which he launched acrowdfunding campaigneight years ago.
The PCGamesN story Kern screenshotted quotes an analyst, Rhys Elliott, who said the early sales numbers “do NOT reflect the smash hit Ubisoft really needs” and posited that the game hasn’t broken even yet. In contrast, Video Games Chronicle reported Monday that the game represents the second-biggest launch in the series and Ubisoft’s best-ever day-one launch on the PlayStation Store, and it garnered a significant amount of PC downloads. The game also got widespread critical acclaim from English-language outlets as well asgaming outlets based in Japan, despite early concerns about the game’s cultural and historical accuracy. That’s not to mention thehandful of X usersclaiming that Ubisoft’s recent social media strategy has tipped them toward buying the game.
The narrative thatShadowsisn’t doing well is one that’s been hard-fought by keyboard warriors who firstcriticized the game’s inclusion of the Black samurai Yasuke. In truth, Ubisoft’s inclusion of Yasuke is either boosting the game up, or not making a difference. The game is getting played a lot, and maybe it’ll get played even more now that Ubi has one-shotted Musk on his own social media platform.

"Games run great on it, but the $2,000 price hurts
byTyler Colp
The most powerful graphics card you can buy right now is actually pretty worthless if you don’t have the right PC gaming setup. Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5090 is at its best when paired with a 4K monitor that can reach high refresh rates, like 144 Hz or 240 Hz. Anything less than that diminishes the value of an already ridiculously expensive card.
A graphics card as beefy as the RTX 5090 needs to chew on the toughest games to justify its $1,999 price tag. I’m talking aboutAlan Wake 2with everything set to max, orCyberpunk 2077with all the ray tracing on. It’s a card for people who don’t mind paying to not have to fiddle with graphics settings. Chances are, you already know if that’s you or not.
The RTX 5090 didn’t transform my experience with games — it mostly saved me time. I’ve been using a card sent to me for review by Nvidia, and over the last month I haven’t had to think about frame rate. Even a game asunstable asMonster Hunter Wildsran almost flawlessly on my PC — which is equipped with an Intel Core i9-12900K 5.2 GHz 16-core processor, 32 GB of RAM, and a 1000 W power supply. I’m also running everything on an 4K 32-inch MSI OLED monitor. All the reports of stuttering and abysmal frame rates didn’t affect me. And that’s really the whole reason you’d buy the most expensive graphics card in the world right now: to boot up any game and know it’ll have enough overhead to run just fine.
That doesn’t mean I’d recommend it, though. Even if it were possible tofind one in stock, the RTX 5090 isn’t worth it for almost anyone in need of an upgrade or looking to build a gaming PC. There are far more reasonable options out there, particularly in Nvidia’s previous generations of cards.
That’s largely because you don’t actually need an RTX 5090 to benefit from several of its best features. The 40-series cards can use both DLSS 4 and Frame Generation, which leaves the RTX 5090’s primary advantages in Multi Frame Generation and raw horsepower. In other words: The RTX 5090 is mostly a peek at what future hardware iterations could be capable of at more reasonable prices. It’s proof that Nvidia’s AI-powered upscaling technologies, DLSS and Frame Generation, can get even better than they already were. Both of them really do feel like magic when they work, and they’re only becoming more important as it gets harder and harder to afford the latest hardware.
For example: I cranked up every single setting inCyberpunk 2077as high as it would go. My frame rate chugged as the RTX 5090 churned out scenes with real-time reflections in the puddles and cars whizzing by. But unless I wanted to spend hours people-watching in Night City, the game was unplayably slow. With DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation on, however, it went from a choppy mess in motion to a slightly sluggish but playable game that was hitting upward of 120 frames per second. I could run through the busy market full of NPCs and neon signage without a hitch. If I was willing to put up with a slight delay between my button presses and the actions on screen — similar to how it feels to stream a game over the cloud —Cyberpunk 2077was playable at a high frame rate on settings that were mostly a novelty in the past.
It still wasn’t smooth enough to justify relatively minor improvements in the lighting over less absurd graphics settings. The more you rely on Multi Frame Generation to insert AI-created frames, the more input lag is introduced, meaning your button presses will have a noticeable delay. In situations where you need to drastically increase the frame rate to make the game visually playable, you’ll have to sacrifice responsiveness. And it hurts a fast-paced first-person shooter likeCyberpunk 2077the most. It was certainly impressive seeing the game run well above 60 frames per second on a high-refresh-rate monitor. Normally, that would require a lot of graphical sacrifices to pull off. But just because it was playable doesn’t mean it was tolerable. It’s a feature much better suited for when you’re not aiming for super-high frame rates, which is why I see no reason to invest in an RTX 5090 and an expensive monitor for it. And remember: Nvidia’s other 50-series cards can use Multi Frame Generation too, so the high frame rate life doesn’t require the top-of-the-line GPU.
DLSS 4 is a similar story. This version of the upscaling tech uses a new AI model that basically makes details on objects look a little less blurry, especially in motion. On my 4K monitor, I had to stop and squint inAlan Wake 2andMarvel Rivalsto really notice a difference. Things like raindrops sliding down a window or blades of grass had slightly sharper details in DLSS 4 over DLSS 3, but my frame rates were about the same. These are the kinds of improvements worth waiting 10 minutes to download new drivers that enable it on your 40-series card, rather than spending thousands of dollars on an RTX 5090.
The only tiny caveat to that is Ray Reconstruction, a high-end feature for games with the fanciest ray tracing, which is also known as path tracing. Path tracing makes even the RTX 5090 sweat from all the calculations it has to do to accurately track how light bounces around a scene. Lesser cards can barely handle it. It’s the kind of thing you turn on, admire for 30 seconds, and turn off again to reclaim the chunk of frames it eats up. Ray Reconstruction uses AI-powered denoisers to make the job significantly easier, which causes it to take a much smaller bite out of your frame rate. While you can definitely see and feel the difference in games likeCyberpunk 2077— headlights cast sharper cones of light on the road as you drive — it feels like the first step in making path tracing less of a luxury feature.
DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation overshadow a lot of the raw power of the RTX 5090. Everything fromDiablo 4toAssassin’s Creed Shadowsran exceptionally well on it, easily hitting over 60 fps. That was the same case inAlan Wake 2andMarvel Rivals. Both games gained about 20 to 30 fps over my RTX 4090, and were able to sit comfortably at 60 fps even during intense action. The slight increases weren’t particularly noticeable without staring at the fps counter, though. In practice, all it really meant was that there were fewer times where the frame rate would dip low enough for me to notice it. That kind of overhead is nice to have, especially when you’re trying to hit solid fps at 4K, but it’s not enough to justify hunting an RTX 5090 down and shelling out the money for it, especially when anyone with an RTX 4090 or anRTX 5080will be able to take advantage of DLSS and regular Frame Generation already.
The RTX 5090 is the most powerful GPU right now, but it’s also the most niche GPU right now. It’s not a substantial upgrade from the RTX 4090, nor is it the most cost-effective upgrade for those who have an RTX 30-series or older card. It’s a high-end GPU for people who don’t need a review to tell them whether it’s worth it or not. For everyone else, it’s really just a concept for where graphics tech is headed. Eventually, a much cheaper card with these features will come around. You’re better off acting like it doesn’t exist while you take advantage of all the software improvements Nvidia made along with it.

"Fluid simulation and ray tracing make it one of the best looking games in a long time
byTyler Colp
When the wind hits inAssassin’s Creed Shadowsthe world feels alive. Leaves whip up into the air, grass dances back and forth, and Naoe’s hair sways from side to side. It’s a stunning effect that enriches the game’s shifting seasonal and weather systems. According to aDigital Foundry interviewwith a few of the game’s rendering engineers, the wind isn’t actually wind at all — it’s invisible fluid.
That’s right: All the realistic wind physics are actually made from a fluid simulation moving through the world. It’s a common technique used in lots of games, and the math has given good effects in games as different asGod of WarandDwarf Fortress.So why not here, too?
The Ubisoft developers callAssassin’s Creed Shadows’dynamic weather system Atmos, and it was created to support its seasonal theme. As Naoe’s revenge story oscillates between two periods of her life, the seasons shift too. You might be trudging through thick blankets of winter snow covering the Japanese countryside for one moment, and then sprinting through verdant fields after it all melts away in the next. Eventually, you can even change the seasons on command.
Combined with its new ray-traced lighting effects,Assassin’s Creed Shadowsmight be one of the best looking games out there. For me, it’s certainly the first time ray tracing has ever felt essential for creating a mood and atmosphere that enriches the storytelling. Digital Foundry’s video has the nitty gritty details, but basically the game injects ray tracing into older technology to more accurately light scenes. Shoji glows while you’re standing inside buildings, and there are darker shadows on objects where the sunlight can’t reach in the open world. With ray tracing off, all the contrast disappears and dulls the world. The experts atDigital Foundrycall the difference a “generational divide in lighting fidelity.”
Assassin’s Creed Shadowsis the kind of game that makes a convincing argument for investing in aPlayStation 5 Proor a gaming PC with a50-series Nvidia graphics card. On the Pro, it can run at a smooth 60 frames per second with ray tracing enabled, and it will fully support Sony’s PSSR upscaling technology in a future update. On PC, DLSS and Frame Generation can easily carry you to 60 fps on an RTX 4070 or newer.
And you’ll benefit from all that horsepower because it’s not just the lighting. It’s how dynamic features like the wind or being able to slice bamboo apart enhance the level of interactivity, or tactile feel of the world — similar to what it’s like playingThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.Asssassin’s Creed Shadowshas set a new bar by using all the power of modern computing not for pure hyper-realism, but for creating a living, breathing world to inhabit.

"A leaked image suggests Steam is coming to the Xbox PC app — and maybe consoles, too
byOli Welsh
Microsoft seems intent on tearing down the norms of game-industry competition between platforms. Not content with publishingprecious first-party games on rival consoles, it now looks as though Xbox is ready to link arms with the leading PC gaming platform, Steam.
The Verge reportsthat Microsoft briefly published an image on Thursday depicting a new, cross-device user interface for Xbox. A filter for “Steam” is clearly visible in the view of a user’s game library shown in the image.
The image was published in a blog titled “Opening a Billion Doors with Xbox” about Microsoft’s currentplatform-agnostic strategy. (Sample quote: “Our goal is simple: to make every screen in the world an Xbox.”) The image was apparently quickly removed by Microsoft after The Verge inquired about it.
The publication of the image seems to have been a mistake. Does it really indicate that Steam integration is coming to Xbox? And, in a world where every screen is an Xbox, what does that mean exactly?
It’s certainly not outlandish that Microsoft might seek to make users’ Steam libraries visible within the Xbox PC app in this way. The Verge’s sources said that Microsoft plans to make every game installed on a PC visible within the Xbox app, and other PC game launchers, like GOG, do this.
But there’s also a real chance that Microsoft is thinking of expanding Steam integration beyond desktop PCs. The image shows the new Xbox UI running on multiple devices: a laptop, a phone, a tablet, and an Asus ROG Ally handheld, as well as a TV. Xbox consoles are also pictured. This is consistent with Microsoft’s announced strategy tocombine Windows and Xbox experiencesin a new, unified UI that will reportedly feature on anXbox-branded PC handheld from a partner manufactureras early as this year.
Could Steam integration come to future Xbox consoles as well as desktop and handheld PCs? It’s far from fanciful to suggest it. Xbox chiefPhil Spencer told Polygon last yearthat he thinks console platforms should be more open, like PCs, and that he’s open to putting rival storefronts like the Epic Games Store — or, it follows, Steam — on Xbox consoles.
Windows Centralrefers to persistent rumors of a partnership between Microsoft and Valve to put Steam on the next generation of Xbox consoles — rumors that Polygon has also heard (but not verified). The next-gen Xbox consoles — a dedicated handheld, and a successor to the Xbox Series X — aresaid to be more PC-like devices, running on a Windows-based development environment.
Considering all that, it’s surprisingly easy to picture Steam as an integral part of Xbox in future. This latest image is likely a mock-up, and its publication was surely an unintended slip. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a sign of things to come.

"Valve’s masterpiece still carries the platform on its back
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
New Half-Life games make me do stupid things. WhenHalf-Life 2came out on PC, I trekked to GameStop to trade in my Xbox, controllers, and games. I had hoped to score hundreds in trade-in credit, but the associate discovered my console was soft-modded and quartered the quote as a result — barely enough to cover the game. It didn’t run very well on my parents’ eMachines desktop (as a console player at the time, I didn’t know what recommended specs were). I was very sad when a port of the game eventually came to Xbox.
Half-Life: Alyxlaunched on March 23, 2020, nearly five years ago. I actually had a solid gaming PC that could run it. However, I didn’t have a VR headset, which is a necessary component. I immediatelyhadto have one, ideally a model that wouldn’t leave a $1,000 crater in my checking account likeValve’s Indexwould. I ended up buying a refurbishedOculus Riftfor $250 or so, and over the course of a memorable week, I beatAlyx, then promptly returned the headset for a refund while my jaw was still on the floor from its incredible finale.
It wasn’t long until I bought the wire-freeQuest 2later in 2020, another questionable financial decision, but I kept this one. Then I replayedAlyxthe way that it was meant to be experienced, which is with roomscale movement — no headset-tracking base stations required. I could kneel down, turn around, and just generally feel like I existed in the world, without concerns of tripping over a cable tethering me to my PC.
These hoops were worth jumping through forHalf-Life: Alyx, and those of you who’ve played it would likely agree. I haven’t played a VR game since with as much graphical polish, as much atmosphere, or as much consideration for different play styles and varying levels of comfort with VR mobility. It’s also the best-paced game I’ve played in VR; it’s the only title I’ve wanted to keep playing beyond my “oh, I don’t feel so good” threshold, which is somewhere around the 30-minute mark.
While the end goal of most of its encounters is to shoot bad guys and creatures with guns,Alyxoffers more open-endedness to encounters and to exploration in general. Once you clear a room, you can practice thwipping and throwing items with your gravity gloves, play the piano, or gawk at the stellar quality of theliquid shaders in bottlesbefore you smash them on the ground. You can open cabinets, fridges, and more, stacking each item you pull out realistically on top of the others. Why you would want to do that is beyond me (also, I did this), but the point is that youcoulddo it.Alyxput you in charge of how you spent your time in VR, not the other way around.
It’s trite to say this five years after launch, butHalf-Life: Alyxfelt like a door being kicked open, revealing what’s possible in VR. And, with the backing of one of gaming’s most beloved developers, I considered its release a possible turning point for VR tech going mainstream. I just really wanted everyone to be able to try it.
VR headset adoption has grown exponentially since 2020, thanks to Meta’s somewhat affordable Quest lineup of headsets. ThePlayStation VR 2can now be used on PCs, no longer exclusively tied to the PlayStation 5 (and it’s $200 less than it was at launch,costing $399.99). But since owning a powerful, costly gaming PC is the other part of the equation, that growth hasn’t made it all that much easier for more players to try games likeHalf-Life: Alyx. I wish Valve would port the game to PS5 so PSVR 2 owners could play it there. But since it hasn’t happened yet, more than two years after the headset’s launch, I’m not holding my breath. Maybe Valve is prepping a version of the game for its oft-rumored wire-free VR headset “Deckard” that our pals atThe Vergehave written about. Or maybe it’s not.
While there have been other great VR-only games sinceAlyx(Horizon Call of the Mountain, Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR, Batman: Arkham Shadow, to name a few that swung for the fences), the virtual reality segment has struggled to keep up the pace with new, must-play games. That’s sad, though it makes me treasureHalf-Life: Alyxeven more. It was a huge gamble to release the long-awaited prequel to one of the most influential games in virtual reality, requiring hardware that very few had then, and still very few have today. To that end, every developer making VR games is knowingly making a huge gamble that may not pan out in their favor.
Sure, I wish thatAlyx’s story could be played directly on consoles and PC so that more fans can play the game, but without gravity gloves, that would spoil all of the fun. When or if that’ll ever happen isn’t for us to decide. So, go ahead, do a stupid thing and buy a VR headset just so you can playHalf-Life: Alyx, even if you return it right after (I won’t tell). The game is just$17.99during the Steam Spring Sale, which lasts until March 20.

"Assassin’s Creed: Shadows is a 123 GB download — do you have enough room?
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Assassin’s Creed Shadowsis launching March 20, and given its whopping 123 GB install size, it’s likely that you’ll need to offload a game or two to make room for it. If you’re hoping to play it on your handheld PC, be it aSteam Deck, anAsus ROG Ally, or something else, perhaps you’re in need of an extra microSD card. If so,Samsung’s 512 GB microSD cardis currently half off at Amazon, costing $37.99.
123 GB sure is a lot of space, butShadowsisn’t even the worst offender when it comes to file sizes.Baldur’s Gate 3requires 150 GB on PC, and recent Call of Duty games approach that, too. 100+ GB installs are becoming the norm in PC games, particularly in open-world games (Grand Theft Auto 6is sure to be humongous in size). So, even if you aren’t jumping into any of the aforementioned games, it’s never a bad idea to snag a microSD card while they’re this cheap because you’ll need the extra storage someday.

"Most devices don’t support PCIe 5.0, narrowing this SSD’s appeal
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
PlayStation 5andPS5 Proowners, as well as most PC users, don’t need to get worked up about PCIe 5.0 SSDs. Sure, they boastmuchfaster advertised speeds than PS5-ready PCIe 4.0 models, which are reasonably affordable these days — 2 TB costs around $150— and come in different storage configurations and styles. But, most mainstream gaming devices and PCs aren’t built to take advantage of PCIe 5.0 speeds. The ones thatarecompatible haven’t given me enough reasons to get jealous … yet.
I say this as someone who has the new Samsung 9100 Pro in-hand (out today), but can’t actually take full advantage of its ludicrous speeds. My newly-rebuilt PC supports PCIe 5.0 SSDs, but there are other bottlenecks in my system (such as the PCIe 3.0 SSDs I use for game installs and the OS) that would provide an imperfect view of the 9100 Pro’s performance. While I love tofind excusesto upgrade my PC, testing videos I’ve seen indicate that the PCIe 5.0 storage isn’t worth overhauling my system for.
As seen from thisvideofrom the YouTube channel Testing Games that shows PC game loading times with PCIe 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 SSDs next to each other, the results aren’t a night-and-day difference in the newer tech’s favor. We’re talking one to three seconds in terms of loading speed, depending on the game (sometimes more, sometimes less). This2024 video from Linus Tech Tipsshows scenarios in which PCIe 5.0 is merely on par with PCIe 4.0 in PCs (and in some rare cases, slightly behind). Regardless, it’s important to note that neither of the testing videos above include Samsung’s new 9100 Pro, so it’s not fair to assume its performance without having put it through its paces. I look forward to seeing if this one changes the narrative.
To put the 9100 Pro’s speed improvements in context, it’s fun to compare it to Samsung’s first PCIe 4.0 SSD,the 980 Pro. Samsung’s new 9110 Pro doubles the 980 Pro’s sequential read speed (14,800 MB/s vs. 7,000 MB/s) and nearly triples its sequential write speed (13,400 MB/s vs. 5,000 MB/s). Sequential gains are nice, but since most workloads (and games) access data randomly, random read /write speeds are more important to consider. Those are improved in the 9100 Pro, too, even when compared to the last-gen 990 Pro. The $219.99 (1 TB with heatsink) starting price makes sense given the speed increases, though it’s astronomical in price compared to the 990 Pro, which currently costs $179.99 at Amazon for the2 TB heatsink model.
It’s unclear as to whether Samsung is done making improved versions of PCIe 4.0-based SSDs, since the990 Pro approached the theoretical speed limit. But if you’re questioning whether you should get a Samsung 990 Pro or any other competing PCIe 4.0 SSD with comparable read / write speeds, I’d suggest following your budget.
If you have a large budget, it’s not completely (only slightly) unreasonable to buy the 9100 Pro if you plan to eventually upgrade to a PCIe 5.0 system down the line. This and all PCIe 5.0 SSDs are backwards compatible in PCIe 4.0 hardware, including the PS5, albeit with slower data transfer speeds than advertised. Therearetangible benefits to having faster storage when it comes to moving data around (assuming your hardware can take full advantage of it), but even so, it doesn’t usually improve gameplay as much as a new graphics card and processor upgrade can. If you play online multiplayer games primarily, those won’t be a great showcase of the 9100 Pro’s prowess as you’ll load into the game at the same speed as everyone else.

"Sigil requires a subscription for full access, but it plays more like a pre-alpha mess
bySam Machkovech
Dungeons & Dragons’Sigilplatform, available in full with theMaster Tier subscription to D&D Beyond, would be much easier to recommend if there was an asterisk in the title. The seminal tabletop role-playing game’s firstinternally produced 3D virtual tabletop (VTT) appis finally live, and it offers players and Dungeon Masters alike a lavish workspace to move 3D minis around in an online-connected computer interface. But it has landed without the asterisk that it so very clearly needs, or perhaps another indicator of its incomplete state — words like “alpha,” “beta,” or “early access.” Because if anyone pays for a D&D Beyond subscription expecting a complete or even fully functional experience, they’re going to be sorely disappointed.
At first blush, the app comes off as immediately handsome, with 3D-rendered miniatures, terrain, and lighting all powered byUnreal Engine 5. In motion, it capably evokes scenes fromBaldur’s Gate 3. Its formal ties to D&D Beyond, which include the ability to import characters and content from Wizards of the Coast sourcebooks, shows promise but currently feels unfinished. A spin through the interface’s premade assets includes enough introductory content to excite and tantalize any longtime D&D fan. But dig deeper, and the wheels start to come off.
The bottom line is thatSigilhas arrived somewhat incomplete, and the messaging from the team makes me wonder if it may ever get the additional features it so badly needs. Based on how the app feels as of last month’s launch, I can see a path that leads to that kind of future. But theSigilof today is nowhere near the likes of Yartar yet.
The concept forSigilfirst appeared in the back pages of the 4th editionPlayer’s Handbook, a document published back in 2008. The idea sounds simple: Create a three-dimensional play space where players can aim a camera and move their miniatures to recreate the experience of sitting at a table with friends. But the implementation is incredibly difficult, with reams of rules to mitigate and more edge cases than you can shake an owlbear at.
That’s why over the last 17 years dozens of competing VTTs have sprung up — including some that were, and still are, officially licensed to support the rules and beloved campaigns published for D&D. SoSigilisn’t just competing againstOwlbear Rodeo,Foundry, and other decent alternatives, but against mature platforms that host the same source material, includingRoll20andFantasy Grounds. In fact,Sigilis even competing againsta second internally produced virtual tabletop called Mapsthat got spun up by Wizards in the last few years. But while Maps is actually listed as being in beta, other than not being 3D it still does a fair bit more thanSigildoes today — and that includes when you’ve paid the monthly subscription fee.
In good news for Wizards,Sigil’s biggest differentiator is dramatic: its aesthetics. Every building block fits together to emphasize Unreal’s strengths. The dynamic lighting is absolutely beautiful, especially in terms of how UE5 realistically bounces light sources off of different materials, from cobblestone walls to ornate floor rugs. (Go ahead, move a wall-mounted lantern around to see for yourself; it’s a funSigilparty trick.) Surfaces and props benefit from incredible texture fidelity, so that long glances at any wood plank, mine cart, or spore overgrowth hold up to scrutiny. D&D is a stop-zoom-and-ponder kind of game, andSigilholds its own as a place for players to appreciate between turns.
Sigil’s included building blocks are themed after familiar zones like woodland villages, abandoned cobblestone structures and graveyards, and subterranean dungeons and mines. There’s enough variety in terrains, props, and bespoke items to build a certain kind of campaign, but longtime DMs won’t need long to notice missing biomes and props. As of press time, there’s no way to manually make and insert, say, a wagon or caravan.
If you expected to bring your tiny virtual paintbrush toSigil, take a deep breath; this app isn’t for you
Customization is worse for mini creation: only six species of player characters, only one face for most of these species, and a surprising limit on custom colorization for the scant selection of weapons and armor. If you expected to bring your tiny virtualpaintbrushtoSigil, take a deep breath; this app isn’t for you.
The same goes for anyone who expects to seamlessly plug their sessions into D&D Beyond — the online digital tool set used to create characters and roll dice online.Sigilcurrently doesn’t support everything a player or DM might create or maintain in D&D Beyond — with the exception of character sheets, which I’ll get to. TheSigilsilo does include the latest 5e ruleset refresh, along with every creature in the newestMonster Manual(2025), some as 3D minis, others as 2D tokens.
There are two ways, then, to approachSigilas a sandbox. The first is a fully contained D&D adventure facsimile, in which participants move minis around a 3D space, select actions, aim attacks, roll virtual dice, and let the app automatically manage the resulting math.
The second, which is the only way I’ve enjoyed using Sigil, is one where every connected player keeps character sheets, sourcebooks, and a pad of paper handy, so as to manually track everything that the app fails to do in its current state.
In the latter case,Sigilhas proven to be a fascinating and sometimes capable option for a VTT DMing novice, as far as letting DMs build either flat or multi-story terrain with a simple and mostly easy-to-use interface. Scroll through pre-built pieces, ranging from generic terrain to standard TTRPG objects (traps, barrels, tables) to ornate objects like wells and fortified towers, then move and click them together as you see fit.
This isnotas rich an object-manipulation environment as Unreal’s default creation engine, so it lacks crucial world-building toggles like undoing and mid-creation locking, but it’ll get the job done. What’s more, only one person in your D&D group has to pay a monthly fee to unlockSigilfor group play. (However, everyone will need a gaming-grade PC to useSigilas individual party members, since it’s a demanding, graphically intensive app, not a breezy web-based application.)
Once players join a session, however,Sigilbegins to crumble. Its general management of stats, abilities, and math is too variable and untrustworthy. The simple act of importing a D&D Beyond character leaves a bad first impression, with unclear steps as to how to couple such a character with aSigilmini, along with the glaring issue of various elements often not importing correctly — important stuff like hit points, armor class, or even a character’s full inventory often fail to import correctly, or at all.
These inconsistencies can make combat a bit of a circus. DMs at any time can toggle “encounter mode,” at which point all players and monsters’ initiatives are rolled (including hidden minis), then turn order plays out automatically. This is when players may discover that they can ignore D&D’s inherent limits and house-rule their way to whatever actions they want — which might be fine if DMs had the option to enable or disable such chaos. They can’t, andSigil’s tiny, hard-to-scroll encounter log doesn’t always announce these actions to fellow party members or DMs. (Related: There’s no built-in voice functionality or text chat log. You’ll need to use a third-party chat app.)
In some cases, toggling an attack for either a player or a monster will fail to bring up an expected workflow of aiming the attack, rolling for hit, and damage being calculated. Maybe the aiming reticle never appears. Maybe aiming happens, but nothing is rolled. Or maybe the roll shows numbers that suggest, based on every stat and character sheet loaded intoSigil, that there would be damage, only for no damage to be accounted for. And that’s not even beginning to address the outright missing abilities for various classes — an issue thatSigil’s own release notes address without suggesting that they’ll ever fix it.
What hope is there forSigil? In its current state, all hope lies in ignoring nearly every built-in function and leaving the important accounting to DMs, as ifSigilwere merely a set of building blocks. (Interestingly, this makesSigila solid VTT toolset to experiment with if you’re coming from rulesets likePathfinder, since it still includes TTRPG tropes like built-in virtual dice rolls for all players to see and share.)
Connect with friends onSigilinside of a DM’s custom-built map, and you really do have everything you need to manage shared vision of a 3D, mini-filled space, including a virtual tape measure and “look here” highlights and pings. DMs additionally can establish fog of war and manage the hiding and revealing of any object they see fit (monsters, traps, furniture, whatever).
The most realistic request on my currentSigilwishlist is a premade “favorites” tab for DMs, for the sake of quicker, mid-session improvisation; otherwise, DMs must either pre-place hidden monsters or pick through a massive list of hundreds of tokens and minis.
I’m otherwise spooked bySigil’s unceremonious dumping into the D&D Beyond subscription service in its current state, along with release notes that suggest missing features may never be addressed. OnSigil’s official Discord community, the development team is cataloguing and responding to bug reports and requests, but their current pile of issues seems pretty grand before entertaining notions thatSigilwill ever support third-party content, custom-built 3D assets, or ways for DMs to customize the game’s internal rules and math.
Thanks for the fun set of D&D-themed blocks, Wizards. Until you make it easier for players to click them together in a more automated way, I don’t recommend anyone but the bravest DMs pay for them.

"This delightful fusion of Silent Hill, Persona, and light-gun shooters is now out on consoles
byMichael McWhertor
I had no idea what I was getting into when I jumped into the world ofSorry We’re Closed, a narrative-driven survival horror adventure that pairs the grime and decay of Silent Hill with the stylish, sexed-up demons of Persona games. But the artists behindSorry We’re Closedhave managed to remix some of my favorite gaming memories into something unique and surprising.
That even includes pairing Resident Evil-style tank controls and fixed camera angles with arcade light-gun shooters. Somehow all of these disparate gameplay influences come together in a nearly magical way.
Sorry We’re Closedfocuses on Michelle, a struggling, heartbroken Londoner who has an unlucky encounter with a sleep-paralysis archdemon known as the Duchess. This experience sends Michelle on a journey of discovery, during which she becomes immersed in a world of angels and demons in conflict; this experience ultimately unlocks magical powers within her. Cursed with mystical vision through a third eye, Michelle can see through the veil of the real world into the demon world and converse with its residents.
The Duchess has pursued Michelle as part of the archdemon’s mission to find love, and she’ll stop at nothing to convince her heartbroken prey to give in to these advances. Rebuffing her archdemon suitor, Michelle works with her friends (some of whom have secretly been demons this whole time) to break free of the Duchess’ curse and chase down the archdemon’s former flames/victims.
Michelle’s Evil Eye vision comes into play both narratively and in gameplay. With the press of a button and a snap of her fingers, Michelle can see other layers of her world, uncovering secret doors, hidden objects, and the corporeal forms of ethereal figures.Sorry We’re Closeduses this vision for environmental puzzles as well; a painting of eyes on a wall in the real world is revealed to be a smart-mouthed eye demon that blocks a pathway, and obstructions like an indestructible metal box can be revealed in the demon world as wooden boxes that can be smashed with an ax.
These Evil Eye powers also factor into combat. In the real world, you’ll face monsters that can be killed with multiple swings of an ax or riddled with bullets. But if Michelle flicks on her Evil Eye, she can see into the hearts of her enemies, attacking their weak point to slay them quickly. Michelle’s otherworldly vision only extends so far, though. There’s a trade-off between fighting enemies inefficiently in the real world at distance and allowing them to get closer so Michelle can kill them quickly but incur more risk in the process.
Combat and movement can be a bit clunky inSorry We’re Closed. While exploration is done in third-person view, combat switches to a sometimes disorienting first-person view. Here, the developers draw influence from light-gun games like Time Crisis or House of the Dead, pushing the player to attack rapidly and chain together combos. Pulling off a series of perfect attacks charges up a weapon called the Heartbreaker, a powerful rifle that deals massive damage to enemy demons.
Combat encounters inSorry We’re Closedclicked with me, but I can see them being a sticking point for some players. Fortunately, failure inSorry We’re Closedis rarely frustrating. The game has a manual save system with frequent save points and generous autosaving. While rationing bullets and health items — water bottles, because it’s important to stay hydrated — is a concern, the game is less punishing than many other survival horror games. (Accessibility options can also make the game much, much easier.)
Beyond combat and exploration of the game’s demonic worlds, Michelle spends a good deal of her time conversing with friends, frenemies, and the angels and demons she can see through her third eye. There’s a rich cast of characters, many of them relatably flawed people trying their best to find love or heal from trauma. These characters (and monsters) are all beautifully realized;Sorry We’re Closedoozes style with its mix of horny, elegant, and wonderfully weird misfits. It’s lovely to see a horror game with bright, flashy pops of color.
Sorry We’re Closedhas been out on PC platforms since November 2024. Developer à la mode games and publisher Akupara Games have since brought the game to consoles (Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X) and upgraded the original release with new features. For survival horror fans looking for a queer-romance-infused spin on retro Resident Evil-style gameplay,Sorry We’re Closedcomes highly recommended. You might just fall in love, which is exactly what the Duchess wants.
Sorry We’re Closedwas released Nov. 14, 2024, on Windows PC and March 6 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

"﻿Want some tea?
byNicole Carpenter
A few years ago, a sound bite went viral on TikTok: “Darling, I’ve told you several times before, I have no dream job. I do not dream of labor.”As writer Caitlyn Clark put it in Jacobin at the time, it’s no surprise that the statement resonated with people: a “tighter labor market,” Clark wrote, put increased pressure on workers over the past several years. It’s an increased strain that’s put more and more money in the pockets of the richest among us, yet it hasn’t created better workplaces or a better world for the rest of us. And I’ve been thinking about this phrase — “I do not dream of labor” — as I play developer Ivy Road’sWanderstop. Though the foot on protagonist Alta’s neck is not one of a corporation, but of an individual drive to succeed at all costs — certainly influenced by culture at large — she is ultimately worn down so severely that she can no longer continue. She’s forced to rest, to engage in a less laborious life. But her new life does, indeed, involve labor.
Wanderstopbegins with prolific and successful fighter Alta failing. It’s her first major failure — something she vowed would never happen to her. She had gone to a forest in search of a woman who can train her up, bring her back to her peak form, but the journey didn’t go as planned. Where she lands, instead, is a tea shop. The affable tea shop owner, Boro, plucked her from the forest after she collapsed, no longer able to wield her sword. She doesn’t want to stay, but she also can’t leave: Every time she tries, she collapses. She can’t hold her sword. And so, she does stay. People start to trickle into the tea shop and its surrounding clearing, so she makes them tea.
At this point, Alta probably does dream of labor — the labor of training and fighting for redemption. But over the course of roughly a dozen hours, she begins to let go of that compulsion. Alta trades one type of labor for another: one that’s more caring, slow, and, yes, healing.Wanderstop’s tea shop does not operate for profit. The land around the shop provides everything necessary to make a cup of tea, aside from the tea-making contraption itself. This is whereWanderstoppulls in its cozy gaming elements — the comforting repetition of a farming simulator, with a little twist, is the backbone of its gameplay. Working as Alta, I must plant seeds in specific formations to produce different sorts of plants to harvest both seeds and fruits; the seeds keep the farming running, and the fruits I use to brew tea. I explore the forest for tea leaves, sweep up piles of dead greenery, and snip invasive vines. The tea leaves get dried, and then I can make tea for the different people who pass by.
Each of these people stays briefly at the tea shop, their own stories playing out with every interaction. At first, Alta is desperate for labor — begging people to let her make them tea. But that attitude shifts with each cup of tea she makes as she grapples with her dark past, something she’s long blocked out. Her new form of labor, the act of foraging for ingredients, growing essential fruits, and brewing tea to serve to others, is what’s healing her; she’s engaging in her community in a useful, thoughtful way. Her labor makes a difference not only for herself, but for others, too. Separated from an exploitative system, her work means something more. Beyond the narrative,Wanderstoplargely succeeds at engaging with this ideology through its gameplay. I’m not necessarily rewarded in any way for brewing tea for people in the clearing, other than learning their own stories and preferences. This doesn’t unlock tools to do the job better or faster; I brew tea the same, complicated way each time, using a big ol’ contraption that requires several steps of manual labor.
There’s no real time limit on appeasing these customers; they’ll stay for as long as necessary to get their cup of tea. If you wanted, instead, to brew a dozen cups for yourself or Boro, that’s quite all right. Maybe you’d rather play around with decorations, or test out new combinations of patterns to grow other plants. That’s OK, too. ButWanderstopis a game, and there are still plenty of game-y elements that do detract from its themes. It’s pretty aggressive with its notification icons, for one, so it’s always immediately clear that there’s a new customer to serve or something another wants to tell you. For instance, there’s an early character who’s an eager knight placed under a curse. After one interaction, he sets back out into the forest to complete some task — but in my playthrough, he returned not even a minute later ready to push his own story further, a big yellow exclamation mark over his head as he rushed back toward me. The urgency of these sorts of interactions is entirely at odds with everything else in the game. There’s a meaningful friction in the narrative that makesWanderstopmemorable, but that friction isn’t replicated in the slightest with the gameplay. I can understand why, because adding that friction, be it simply through more time spent waiting or removing notification icons, risks players becoming frustrated and quitting. But it’s a friction that the game could have benefited from to better serveWanderstop’s unique framing.
This all comes back to the idea of dreaming about labor — or not. I don’t dream of labor within the system we live under now, but that doesn’t mean I don’t dream about labor at all. The future I dream of isn’t one without friction, but one that ensures a slower, happier life for my community, even if that means doing the work.Wanderstopfeels the most meaningful when it focuses on that.
Wanderstopwill be released March 11 on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. The game was reviewed on Steam Deck using a pre-release download code provided by Annapurna Interactive.

"Speculation thatStarfieldwill soon be confirmed for release on PlayStation 5 ramped up over the weekend after fans spotted a PlayStation logo on Bethesda’s official Creations website.

The logo was attached to a work-in-progress ship decals Creation for Starfield, and although the Creation was removed, fans are speculating that Bethesda’s so-far PC and Xbox-only sci-fi game is soon set for PS5.
Thoughts inevitably turn to whether Bethesda plans a significant content update, possibly even a new expansion, to coincide with Starfield’s seemingly inevitable release on PS5. There’s been little to shout about when it comes to Starfield in recent months, following the launch of the poorly receivedShattered Space expansion. Bethesda parent company Microsoft is expected to hold another summer showcase this year, as it has done in recent years, and that event may be the right time and place to learn more about all things Starfield.
Bethesda itself has said it has ""exciting things"" planned for Starfield this year, amid growing discontent from players about a lack of communication and updates. In June 2024,Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supportingStarfield, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. In an interview withYouTube channel MrMattyPlays, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”
Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new intellectual property in years, and its first mainline single-player game since Microsoft bought parent company ZeniMax Media in March 2021. IGN’sStarfield reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist.”
In January,Microsoft’s gaming boss Phil Spencer refused to rule out Starfield coming out on PS5.Starfield and MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were both reported as being considered for PS5 as far back as March 2024. Indy ended up confirmed for PS5 with a spring 2025 release window, a few months after its release on PC and Xbox Series X and S. But Starfield is yet to be confirmed for PS5, although Spencer's comments certainly suggested it was on the cards.
A number of Xbox games are currently available on PS5, including Rare’s Sea of Thieves, Tango Gameworks’ Hi-Fi Rush, and Obsidian’s Grounded and Pentiment. Microsoft already publishes Minecraft games on PlayStation consoles, among many other platforms, and is set to publish Doom: The Dark Ages and Ninja Gaiden 4 on PS5 later this year. Playground’s Forza Horizon 5 is also confirmed as coming to PS5 soon. There are even reports thatMicrosoft is finally ready to release Halo on PlayStation after decades of Xbox exclusivity.
Spencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.
“We run a business,”Spencer said in August last year. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.
“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”
It’s a busy time for the 450-person Bethesda Game Studios, which currently operates five teams: Starfield; Elder Scrolls 6; Fallout 76; mobile; and external development partnerships.

"Sony has announced the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for March 2025, confirming the lineup of PS5, PS4, and Classic games set to be made available to download by subscribers.

As outlined on thePlayStation Blog, PlayStation Plus Extra subscribers get eight games this month, including UFC 5, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and Captain Tsubasa: Rise of New Champions.
Meanwhile, PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers get four games in March: PSVR2’s Arcade Paradise VR and the original PlayStation’s FromSoftware trilogy: Armored Core, Armored Core: Project Phantasma, and Armored Core: Master of Arena.
All games are available to play from March 18.
It's worth noting that Sony will cut PS4 games from its PlayStation Plus Essentials monthly games and the Game Catalog from January 2026 to focus solely on PS5.
""As we shift to PS5, PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit and will only be occasionally offered for PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog,"" Sony said. This won't affect the monthly titles players have already obtained, though Game Catalog titles ""will still be available to play until [they] leave the catalog"" as part of the monthly refresh.
""We’ll continue to evolve the experience of PlayStation Plus and optimize the benefits you receive, including exclusive discounts, online multiplayer access, online game save storage, and more,"" Sony added. ""As we shift our focus to PS5, we look forward to adding new PS5 titles monthly for you to enjoy.""

"Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition has hit its lowest price yet,now available for $49.99 at Amazon—its best deal to date, even beating Black Friday, according to our records, and even price-tracking siteCamelCamelCamel.

Originally released on October 8 forNintendo SwitchandPlayStation 4 (fully compatible with PS5), this collection brings together the first six mainline Final Fantasy games in their carefully remastered form. Square Enix has opted for refinement rather than reinvention, keeping the original pixelated aesthetic intact but sharpening it for modern displays.
The result is a collection that looks fantastic, whether on a massive TV or in handheld mode. The soundtrack has also received an orchestral upgrade, with legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu overseeing the new arrangements. On top of that, the package introduces a handful of thoughtful quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to disable random encounters and boost experience and gil gains—useful for those who want to focus on the story without the grind.
As a small but nostalgic extra, this edition includes a sticker sheet featuring 12 classic character sprites, including the Black Mage, a Moogle, Terra, Kain, and a mid-cackle Kefka. It’s not the most extravagant of bonuses, but it’s a fun little touch for fans of the series.
At its original $74.99 price, the collection was a tougher sell, but at $49.99, it's a much easier recommendation for anyone interested in the series’ origins. Whether you’re revisiting these classics or playing them for the first time, this is a well-executed remaster of six of themost influential RPGsever made. And with physical copies being the only collectible edition available, it might be worth picking up before they become harder to find, especially at this time.

"One of the biggest barriers to jumping into the current generation for PlayStation players has been the rising cost of living, squeezing wallets so tight that there's sadly been no room for a PS5 in the budget.

In 2025, however, PlayStation has three new ways that get a new PS5 for less: an almost£110-saving Astro Bot Bundle, an added£50 bonus when trading in a PS4, or ahassle-free leasing option with low monthly payments. Scoring a PS5, my friend, is easier than ever right now.
Editor's Note: Brought to you in partnership with PlayStation.
For those almost ready to pull the trigger on buying a PlayStation 5, but have been waiting for a price drop, buying the Astro Bot bundle is the best way to get on board in more ways than one.
The bundle comes in two forms: you can either buy aPS5 Slim (with disc drive) & Astro Bot for £429.99or purchase aDigital Edition PS5 Slim with Astro Bot for £339.99.
Whichever you go for, those prices are £109.99 lower than if you bought each console and the game individually, which you can put towards more games, another DualSense controller, or leave nestled safely in your savings account.
The delightfully beloved platformer that won Game of the Year at the Game Awards 2024,Astro Botis arguably one of the best titles to have bundled with a new console if you haven't had the chance to play it yet.
Since it's a PEGI 7-rated celebration of PlayStation's history & a fun adventure in its own right, it's one of the finest for any gaming household, whether to play yourself or with the children in your family.
Although trading in your PS4 to put towards a PS5 or PS5 Pro has been an option already, PlayStation is offering an extra £50 on top of what you would normally get for your old console, going as high as £150.
AtPlayStation's Trade-In hub page, you can quickly get your PS4 evaluated, ship your console over free of charge, and receive an added £50 voucher along with what you would get for the trade-in as standard.
For example, you could get £100 for a PS4 Pro in good condition and £50 with the trade-up voucher, totalling £150 off a £339.99 PS5 Digital Console & Astro Bot bundle, leaving you with only £189.99 left to pay for your shiny new PlayStation 5 console and added game to get you started.
If you already have a PS5, but your old PS4 has since been going unused and gathering dust, you can still send in your PlayStation 4 in and put your boosted trade-in money towards a PS VR2 headset—so you can jump into exclusive games likeHorizon Call of the Mountainfor a more affordable price.
For you who want to dive into the PS5 ecosystem but don't have the immediate funds to do so, PlayStation Flex is the console-maker's new interesting way to add a PS5 to your home for as low as a mere £10.99 a month.
This is thanks to PlayStation UK's new partnership with Raylo, a top tech leasing service that has been on the service and earning high Trustpilot reviews since 2019.
Through the newPlayStation Flex pagepowered by Raylo, you can effectively set up a rental agreement and have a PS5 Pro, PS5 Slim, or PS5 Digital Edition delivered to your door. Including those consoles, you can also lease a PSVR 2 and some accessories too:
You can choose a 36-, 24-, 12- or rolling monthly lease with payments being lower the longer you sign up for. No matter which way, PlayStation Flex can make for a quick and easy barrier to entry to start your PS5 journey.

"Fans quick to celebrate the reveal of a Microsoft Flight Simulator PlayStation Store page were left let down after it was discovered that the actual product is little more than “copycat shovelware.”

Xbox and PlayStation fans gathered to discuss a potential port for the popular flight simulation game afterReddit user CreativeRaspberry314 sharedTrophy information related to a potential PS4 and PS5 version earlier today. It would be exciting – ifnot somewhat unsurprising– to see Microsoft bring more Xbox titles to PlayStation fans, butthe spotted store pageisn’t officially related to Microsoft Flight Simulator in any way, shape, or form.
“Sadly, this is just a copycat shovelware game,” oneReddit user added. “Straight up shovelware,” anotheradded. “Actually mental tbh, the picture is a straight up rip-off. If it was MSFS, it'd have the same achievements as the Xbox/Steam versions.”
Instead, the Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation is being published by a company named Grizzly Games Limited. As spotted byEurogamer, the company shares a name with Thronefall developer Grizzly Games but is also completely unrelated to that entity. While that team is responsible for other titles like Superflight and Islanders, theGrizzly Games Limited websitereveals a catalog of what appear to be mobile games featuring glossy, AI-generated materials. The art for its Flight Simulator 2025 project also appears to be generated by AI judging by some of its muddy plane parts and strange designs.
The Thronefall team, meanwhile, provided a statement to Eurogamer related to the discovery of Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation and Grizzly Games Limited. Grizzly Games says it is not associated with the company, adding that it is using “both our name and logo illegally.”
“Furthermore they seem to incorporate the absolute opposite of our values, of what we stand for and what we’re trying to give to the gaming community,” Grizzly Games continued. “Unfortunately our legal resources are limited as a two-person indie team, but honestly I'd love to see this kind of stuff being stopped, especially since it's not only happening to us but lots of indie devs that just lack the legal power.""
As of this story’s publication, the Flight Simulator 2025 page remains live on the PlayStation Store. It describes an experience that “sets a new standard in aviation simulation, combining ultra-realistic flight dynamics with breathtaking visuals.” No gameplay for the project has been revealed.
“Can shovelware just be banned from the store please? It’s packed to the brim with it and makes browsing an absolute chore,” anotherReddit user added. “I don’t remember it being this bad in prior generations.”
PlayStationtook a standagainst what many refer to as “spam” titles in 2022. At the time, it was believed the move was made to fight back against easy-to-Platinum games, or titles that exist almost solely for the purpose of increasing players’ Platinum Trophy count. However, many shovelware titles still exist on the PlayStation Store andother digital storefrontstoday.
Webrought a magnifying glass up to the issue last monthto take a closer look at how shovelware titles impact both gamers and developers. We spoke to multiple developers to learn more about not only how these games find their way onto digital storefronts but PlayStation, Nintendo, Xbox, and Valve’s vetting process.

This entry marks Gundam: The Witch From Mercury's Super Robot Wars debut, putting Suletta alongside a legion of past Gundam pilots appearing in the new title. Alongside G-Witch, Bandai Namco highlights a few other series making appearances in Super Robot Wars Y:
Spearheading development is Bandai Namco Forge Digitals,formerly known as B.B. Studio, which has worked on the past Super Robot Wars games.

"The most surprising reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct might have been a third-party game. Announced near the end of the showcase, FromSoftware is developing a brand-new game calledThe Duskbloods, which has some striking similarities to the beloved PlayStation 4-exclusive Bloodborne.

The Duskbloods is a new game, to be clear, set to arrive sometime in 2026 worldwide, and exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2. Playing as the ""Bloodsworn,"" a group that has gone beyond humanity thanks to special blood, players will enter a violent melee to become the ""First Blood.""
Confirmed in a press release from FromSoftware, The Duskbloods is a PvPvE title with ""online multiplayer at its core,"" with up to eight players battling for the win among themselves. So while all the blood, guns, and machinery brings to mind Bloodborne, it may also have quite a bit in common with the upcomingElden Ring Nightreign, though with some PvP rather than solely co-op PvE.
We didn't get much more than that, besides cryptic teases and some looks at some horrifying beasts and bosses. Still, Bloodborne fans are having a wide variety of reactions to this.
""BLOOD! EVERY FIVE SECONDS THEY TALKED ABOUT BLOOD!"" saidone commenter in the r/Bloodborne post about The Duskbloods on Reddit. Another said: ""That game is 100% Bloodborne 2. I assume the name change is either because it's in a different setting, or because of Sony exclusivity.""
Though The Duskbloods is still different, it's easy to see the connections that would have fans feeling like it's a spiritual sucessor to Bloodborne. And while the Souls games and Elden Ring have gone onto other systems — Elden Ring even got aTarnished Edition locked in for the Switch 2— Bloodborne has remained a PlayStation 4 exclusive since release, not even making it over to PC. A port, sequel, or really anything has been something fans have wanted for years.
""Nintendo really got tired of waiting for Bloodborne 2 and just decided to fund it themselves,"" anothercommenter said. Another reply points out that, much like Bloodborne, The Duskbloods is currently a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. ""Bloodborne was always an exclusive, this is on brand,"" areplier added.
The announcement definitely kick-started the Bloodborne faithful, though reality has been setting in with confirmation that this sounds like a battle royale-style game, rather than a single-player RPG you'd normally expect from FromSoftware.
Some commenters startedexpressing dulled excitementover the revelation that The Duskbloods is a PvPvE experience. Threads have sprung up of fans finding this out, only to then express that between a multiplayer focus and Switch 2 exclusivity, they might not be so eager to jump on for The Duskbloods.
We're due to learn more about The Duskbloods soon, as Nintendo will post an interview with director Hidetaka Miyazaki on its website on April 4. Presumably this will shed some light on how exactly The Duskbloods will work, what its PvPvE will look like, and whether this can truly be enough to sate the Bloodborne fans who've been holding out hope for so long.
For all the other news announced during today's stream, be sure tocheck out our recap of everything announced at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.

"Bloodborneturns 10 years old today, and fans are celebrating by organizing yet another return to Yharnam community event.

FromSoftware’s PlayStation 4 masterpiece launched on March 24, 2015, and helped cement the Japanese developer as one of the greatest of our time. Critical and commercial acclaim followed, and a follow-up in the vein of the Dark Souls sequels seemed inevitable.
But since then… nothing. Why hasn’t Sony followed upBloodbornewith either a current-gen remaster, a full-on sequel, or at the very least a next-gen update that would finally make it officially playable in 60fps? Fans have begged Sony for more Bloodborne ever since it came out. The deafening silence in response remains one of the most puzzling business decisions in all video games.
Earlier this year, we got an explanation of sorts. Following his exit from Sony,PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida revealed his Bloodborne no-show theory. To be clear up front: this is Yoshida’s opinion, which inan interview with Kinda Funny Gameshe stressed was not inside information, or the reveal of the current deliberations within the bowels of Sony itself.
“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida said. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.
“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”
Miyazaki-san is of course Hidetaka Miyazaki, the boss of FromSoftware. And yes, he’s incredibly successful. Not only for the influential Dark Souls series, but, most recently, the mainstream hitElden Ring, which propelled FromSoftware to new heights. So much so thatit’s getting a multiplayer spin-off this year.
And it seems obvious to say Miyazaki will be incredibly busy with multiple projects to direct and a company to run. After Bloodborne came out in 2015, Miyazaki directedDark Souls 3, then 2019’sSekiro: Shadows Die Twicefor Activision, then the aforementioned Elden Ring for Bandai Namco. What's next? Miyazaki has yet to say.
In interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year,Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware.
In the years since, modders have tried to fill the gaps with fan-made projects that improve upon the base PS4 Bloodborne experience. But Sony has taken a dim view.Well-known Bloodborne 60fps mod creator Lance McDonald announced in Januarythat he’d received a takedown notification on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment “asking that I remove links to the patch I posted on the internet, so I've now done so.” The DMCA takedown arrived four years after the mod was released.
Then, just a week later, Lilith Walther,creator ofNightmare Kart, which was previously known asBloodborne Kart, and the eye-catching Bloodborne PSX demake, tweeted to say an old YouTube video of the demake was hit with a copyright claim.
Recently, fans managed to get PS4 emulators to deliver something akin to a remaster on PC. The tech experts atDigital Foundry released a videocovering “a breakthrough in PS4 emulation” via ShadPS4, which means Bloodborne is now fully playable start to finish in 60fps. Could this breakthrough have triggered an aggressive response from Sony? IGN asked Sony for comment at the time, but it has yet to respond.
That’s all we have to go on, really, which leaves Bloodborne fans to take it upon themselves to organize Return to Yharnam community events.Another kicks off today, on Bloodborne’s 10th anniversary, and calls on fans to create a new character, and summon as many random cooperators and invaders as possible, and leave in-game messages flagging they’re a part of this latest community drive.
Perhaps this will be all that’s left for fans to do in the world of Bloodborne forever more.

"Sony and game developer Santa Monica Studio have revealed the Dark Odyssey collection, aGod of War Ragnarökupdate coming to players next week that features in-game equipment themed after one of the franchise's most iconic outfits.

Sony detailed all of the goodies included in its God of War 20th anniversary plans in aPlayStation.Blog post. Dark Odyssey is the real headline here, as it includes a war chest of cosmetic treats for all God of War Ragnarök owners across PlayStation 5 and PC. It’ll arrive as a free update March 20.
Everything included in Dark Odyssey features a clean, black-and-gold look that will no doubt have Kratos and co looking better than ever as they tear their way through Norse mythology. Atreus and Freya both receive their own cosmetic sets as part of the patch, too, as do a variety of the player’s shields and weapons.
The show-stealer, though, is a Dark Odyssey appearance and armor set for Kratos that hearkens back to a skin originally only rewarded to players who managed to beat God of War 2 on God Mode difficulty. Players can claim the content in any Lost Items chest in the base game or immediately in God of War Ragnarök’s roguelike Valhalla mode after the update drops. The patch will also finally introduce the option to customize the appearance of Kratos’ weapons without sacrificing each weapon’s respective ability.
Dark Odyssey Armor & Appearance for Kratos
Dark Odyssey Companion Armor
Dark Odyssey Weapon Appearances & Attachments
Dark Odyssey Shield Appearances & Rönd
God of War Ragnarök released in late 2022, so one simple update was never going to do the series’ 20-year history justice. Also included in Sony’s plans to celebrate God of War is a long list of other activities and offers for those who have stuck with Kratos’ story since the beginning. Highlights include a collection of some snazzy social media assets (that you can downloadhere), an art showcase coming as part ofa collaboration with Los Angeles’ Gallery Nucleus, new merch, sales, multiple vinyl releases covering the franchise’s history, and more. You can pre-order a series of God of War vinyl collections as well as the 20th anniversary retrospective hardcover bookthrough the IGN Storenow.
“On behalf of everyone at Santa Monica Studio, we are immeasurably grateful to have had the chance to build the legacy of this series with and for you, the fans of God of War,” the studio said.
For more on how you can celebrate 20 years of God of War, you can check outan upcoming PlayStation symphony world tour that kicks off next month. You can also read up onwhy we think the next God of War title needs to be just as creative as the ones that came before it.

"Nintendo’s first post-Switch 2 Nintendo Direct Treehouse livestream is being flooded with angry comments from users calling on the company to ""DROP THE PRICE.""

A cursory glance at the YouTube chat for the stream shows a flood of complaints about the pricing of Nintendo’s move to the next-generation, which includes the $449.99 Switch 2 and, perhaps most controversially,the jump to $79.99 for Mario Kart World.
Whilethe Nintendo Switch 2 system itself will retail for $449.99, a bundle is also available with Mario Kart Worldincluded for $499.99, saving $30 on the price of the game.
But Mario Kart World isn’t the only Nintendo Switch 2 game to cost $79.99.Some Nintendo Switch 2 Edition titles, such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, also cost $79.99.
Nintendo has even come under firefor charging for the Switch 2 tutorial video game experience, Welcome Tour, which fans have said should be a free pack-in.Astro's Playroom, for example, comes pre-installed on every PlayStation 5 console, serving additionally as a free tech demo for the DualSense controller.
BookmarkIGN's Switch 2 preorder guide today, and when anything goes live, we'll post links the moment they become available. Get notified when a Nintendo Switch 2 console, game, or accessory preorder listing goes live by following IGN Deals onTwitter/XorBluesky.
The shock at Nintendo’s pricing is now spilling over into the Treehouse livestream, although the presenters have so far, perhaps understandably, ignored the chat. It seems likely that Nintendo will face this sort of thing from the video game community from now on, piling the pressure on the company to address the complaints.

"There is enormous pressure onAssassin's Creed Shadowsto do well for Ubisoft globally after a number of delays and the sales failure of last year’sStar Wars Outlaws. Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number ofhigh-profile flops,layoffs,studio closures, andgame cancellationsin the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release.

Things have got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family isreportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investorson a buyout deal that would let it preserve control of the company's intellectual property.
So, the video game world is watching Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ early performance closely for signs of its success — or failure. So far, Ubisoft has yet to announce a sales figure, but has saidAssassin's Creed Shadows hit 2 million players just two days after launch, surpassing the launches of both Origins and Odyssey.
There’s also a lot of attention on Shadows’ Steam concurrents, which are being compared to those of other triple-A single-player games that recently released, as well as previous Assassin’s Creed games on Valve’s platform.
Shadows became the most-played Assassin's Creed game ever on Steam over the weekend with 64,825 peak concurrent players, although it’s worth noting that it was the first game in the series to launch day-one there since 2018's Odyssey. BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardsaw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.
It’s hard to make a call on whether Shadows is below, meeting, or exceeding Ubisoft’s expectations without knowing what those expectations were. But a source from within Ubisoft, who revealed an internal email reviewed by IGN, has helped us better understand the game’s first weekend performance.
Here’s what we’ve found out: Shadows delivered the second-highest day-one sales revenue in the franchise’s history, behind only 2020’s Valhalla, which launched across the last and current generation of consoles and benefited from stay-at-home gaming fueled by the pandemic.
Shadows also marked Ubisoft’s best ever day-one launch on the PlayStation Store, suggesting particular success on PS5.
But what about PC, given Shadows launched on Steam as well as Ubisoft’s own digital store? According to Ubisoft’s internal communication, 27% of Shadows’ total “activations” were on PC. Ubisoft is telling employees that Steam “played a major role” in Shadows’ performance on PC, without revealing exact sell-through numbers. It says early results “are a strong validation of our decision to return to the platform.”
Generally, Ubisoft is talking up player engagement, which is at “record levels,” and “feedback across moderated, verified platforms — those less affected by review bombing — remains incredibly positive.” Shadows was also the most-wishlisted Ubisoft game of all time, and it’s doing better than any other Assassin’s Creed game on Twitch, even Valhalla.
It’s here that Ubisoft’s internal communication provides context on comparisons between Shadows’ launch and other games in the franchise. What’s clear is that Shadows is not doing as well as Valhalla did at launch, but Ubisoft is saying it’s not fair to compare the two, because Valhalla benefitted from the “perfect storm” of pandemic-fueled stay-at-home gaming and the launch of the Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5 in 2020.
“Valhalla launched under extraordinary conditions — in the middle of a global pandemic, with widespread lockdowns and brand-new console hardware,” the internal communication reads. “It was a perfect storm we may never see again. That’s why it’s more meaningful to compare Shadows to entries like Origins, Odyssey, and Mirage — games released in more typical cycles. And in that frame, Shadows is already setting a new bar as illustrated above.”
Ubisoft also pointed out that Shadows released in March. Historically, Assassin’s Creed games launch just ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving window, which typically boosts sales. Meanwhile, Ubisoft ditched the early access period it normally charges extra for with its games. It’s also worth noting that Ubisoft’s own subscription offering is now available directly on Xbox, which affects sales on Microsoft’s console and muddies sales comparisons.
Money talks, of course, and irrespective of player numbers and engagement, it will be revenue brought in by Assassin’s Creed Shadows that determines the fate of not just the game, but Ubisoft itself. We may not get a clear picture of that until Ubisoft's next financial report in the coming months.

"The Nintendo Switch 2 arrives on June 5, 2025, and it will likely be a hot commodity when it launches. Over on the official Nintendo store, the company is implementing some pre-order measures to ensure bona fide Switch players are getting their pre-orders.

On theMy Nintendo Store, those with a Nintendo Account can register their interest in pre-ordering a Nintendo Switch 2 system and ""select accessories"" from the Nintendo Store. Those who express interest will then get an invitation email once their turn in line comes up, valid for 72 hours. The catch? You'll need to have put in some time on your old Switch, and been a Switch Online member.
""Invitation emails will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis to registrants who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025,"" according to the fine print on the site.
Nintendo also notes that invitations are ""non-transferable"" and will be sent to email addresses associated with the Nintendo Account that registers interest. For the system and each accessory, there will also be a one-per-account limit during the invitation period. Currently on the site, you can express interest in either a base Nintendo Switch 2 system, or the one bundled with Mario Kart World.
Orders will be shipped after purchase, and the approximate shipping date will be provided when ordering. Nintendo also specifies: ""Please note that release-day delivery is not guaranteed due to processing and shipment times.""
While not said outright by Nintendo, all of these measures seem dedicated towards ensuring that someone buying a Switch 2 through this process is someone who wants to purchase and play a Switch 2 for themselves, rather than flip it online.
Scalping has been a frequent problem for new releases of sought-after products. Notably, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S sawscalpers pursuing the new hardware, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game hasbeen dealing with ongoing scalping and shortages.
Valve found some success in its queue system for the Steam Deck, utilizing a method that tied Steam accounts to purchases alongside checks for whether an account was made before, or after, a certain window.It worked, and it's not surprising now to see Nintendo taking similar measures with the My Nintendo Store process.
Of course, there will be other ways to pick up a Switch 2. But hopefully options like this can help some long-time Switch 1 owners avoid the potential chaos of locking down a launch day Switch 2 pre-order.

"Update 3/14/25 12:02 p.m. ET: Like most limited-edition PS5 hardware releases, the stock situation for this controller appears to be severely, uh, limited. It's currently (possibly!) available atPS Direct. Stock is also holding steady atGameStop, but you can only preorder it if you have a Pro membership (you cansign up herefor $25/year).

It's currently sold out atAmazon,Best Buy,Target, andWalmart, though it's possible any of them could get more stock at some point. I'll keep updating this article as things change.
Here’s one for the post-apocalyptic crowd: Sony is releasing a new limited-edition The Last of Us-themed DualSense controller. ThePS5 controllerfeatures an eye-catching black and white design, with trophy icons from The Last of Us Part I and Part II etched into it. It comes out April 10 with an MSRP of $84.99. Preorders are live now at various retailers (see it on PS Direct). Read on for the details.
The controller was made “in close collaboration” with the Naughty Dog creative team. It features white-on-black icons of the Fireflies’ logo on the touchpad, with the moth and wolf on either side of the grips. A number of other icons also appear in glossy black on matte black. The bottom side of the controller has a The Last of Us logo in white on black. It looks very nice and classy overall, I’d say.
On thePlayStation Blog, Naughty Dog Head of Studio and Head of Creative Neil Druckmann and Graphic Designer Megan Mehran said:
“We were excited by the chance to memorialize The Last of Us franchise in a controller that fans and our own team would love. We wanted to ensure that both installments of The Last of Us are represented, via trophy icons printed in black gloss across the controller body. Among the trophies, three particular images will immediately stand out for TLOU fans: The firefly, moth, and wolf. Players will recognize the Fireflies’ iconic spray-painted logo that originated in Part I, while the moth and wolf represent the intertwining lives and duality between Ellie and Abby in Part II.“
This isn’t the first PS5 game-themed limited-edition controller to hit the market. Others based on games likeAstro Bot,Helldivers 2,Spider-Man 2, andFortnitehave come out, among others, some of which are still available. And those are in addition to all the otherPS5 controllers in various colorsthat are available.
This The Last of Us controller comes out right around a couple of related releases. The Last of Us Part II is coming to PC on April 3, while the second season of theHBO showpremieres on April 13.

There really isn't adirectreplacement for PS Plus as it's required for online play on PS5 and PS4, but there are some alternatives with free (or close to free) trials that offer a catalog of games to stream, if you so desire.

Other services like Ubisoft+ and EA Play feature publisher-specific catalogs of games to stream, but they don't currently offer any free trials.

"If you're looking for an OLED TV from a reputable brand name at a great price, then Best Buy has got a solid deal going on right now. The Sony Bravia XR A75L 4K OLED smart TVs are on sale right now with the 55"" model priced at $999.99 and the 65"" model for $1,299.99. These prices are lower than what we saw during Black Friday (the 65"" model was $1499 at the time). Although the A75L is an older generation (2023) TV, it's still one of the best TVs out there in terms of image quality and gaming performance. Especially for the 55"" model, you won't find a better TV for under $1,000.

Generally speaking, OLED TVs are considered the best TVs you can buy right now. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, they offer better image quality, deeper blacks, better contrast ratio, wider color gamut, and super fast response times. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV are easily the best type of TV for viewing 4K HDR content in all of its glory.
OLED technology aside, the A75L has  the features you'd want in a current generation gaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel as well as two HDMI 2.1 ports that can run games in 4K at up to 120fps on a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming console. The OLED panel benefits from a near instantaneous response time (sub 0,.03ms) and supports features like variable refresh rate (VRR) including G-SYNC and auto low latency mode (ALLM). Note that despite this being a Sony TV, it pairs equally well with an Xbox console.
Sony OLED TVs use Google TV as its smart interface. Google TV is intuitive to use and supports voice commands through Google Assistant. You can also pair it with an Android phone to use as a remote.
You don't have to wait for the new 2025 LG TVs to drop to score a great deal on an older generation model. Right now, you can pick up a 202365"" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TVfor just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday. The LG Evo C-series of TVs have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVs, especially for 4K HDR movies and gaming.

"Amazon has recently dropped the price on the2TB SK Hynix P41 PlatinumPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVME solid state drive (SSD) to only $124.99 shipped. The SK Hynix P41 Platinum is one of thefastest PCI-E 4.0 SSDs available, has DRAM cache, and is considerably less expensive than other comparable SSDs like theSamsung 990 Pro($168) and theWD SN850X($154). This is an excellent SSD for either your PlayStation 5 console or gaming PC.

Update:Price has dropped again from $129.99 to $124.99.
SK Hynix might not be as recognizable of a brand as Samsung or Western Digital among consumers, but make no mistake that they are a major player in the flash memory market. SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and one of the world's largest memory chipmakers and semiconductor companies. They supply components for many reputable brands you've probably heard of, like Corsair and G.Skill.
The Platinum P41 is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read speeds of 7,000MB/s and write speeds of 6,500MB/s as well as random read speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and write speeds of 1.3 million IOPS. The Platinum P41 also has a dedicated DRAM cache, Most SSDs at this price point lack any DRAM cache and instead rely on HMB, or system memory, to cover the shortfall. In terms of reliability and stability, th Platinum P41 has been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written. It uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips, both of which are manufactured in-house. SK Hynix warranties this SSD with a 5 year warranty.
The SK Hynix P41 Platinum makes for a great secondary SSD for your PlayStation 5 console since it performs well above Sony's minimum speed recommendation of 5,600MB/s. It's possible this SSD will run fine without a heatsink, but we like to err on the side of caution and would recommend you install one for peace of mind. Besides, you can get a perfectly adequateslim PS5 heatsink for just $7.
The Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.

"Ubisoft has hailed anotherAssassin’s Creed Shadowsplayer milestone, but has yet to confirm a sales figure for the game.

In asocial media post, Ubisoft said Shadows has seen 2 million players since going on sale on March 20, up from the 1 million on day one.
That’s enough to surpass the launches of both Assassin’s Creed Origins and Odyssey, Ubisoft added. “Thank you for joining the journey in Feudal Japan!”
It’s an impressive start for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but it’s worth bearing in mind that Ubisoft has yet to announce a sales figure for the game. Still, we do know it’s the top-selling game on Steam, where Ubisoft recently returned after years of PC launch exclusivity on the Epic Games Store.
At the time of this article’s publication, Assassin’s Creed Shadows was on 58,894 concurrent players on Steam, enough to break into the top 30 most-played games on Valve’s platform. That peak is expected to rise as we continue into the game’s opening weekend.
For comparison, Origins’ all-time Steam peak was 41,551, over seven years ago, and Odyssey’s was 62,069. It seems likely Shadows will become the most-played Assassin's Creed game on Steam later this weekend.
BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardlaunched on Steam on Thursday, October 31, 2024, and saw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.
The true concurrent peak of Assassin’s Creed Shadows will of course be much higher, given it launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S also. Neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.
There is enormous pressure on Assassin's Creed Shadows to do well for Ubisoft globally after multiple delays and the sales failure of last year’sStar Wars Outlaws. Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number ofhigh-profile flops,layoffs,studio closures, andgame cancellationsin the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release. Things got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family and largest shareholder arereportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investorson a buyout deal that would let them preserve control.
Assassin's Creed Shadows has also endured a number of controversies itself, not least in Japan. This week, IGN confirmed thatUbisoft had quietly released a day-one patch for Assassin’s Creed Shadowsthat made a number of important changes seemingly in response to concern from some Japanese politicians about in-game temples and shrines.
In a remarkable exchange this week, Japanese politician and member of the House of Councillors of Japan, Hiroyuki Kada, raised the issue of Assassin’s Creed Shadows in an official government meeting, andShigeru Ishiba, the Prime Minister of Japan, responded.
On Steam at least, Assassin's Creed Shadows is going down very well with players. It has a 'very positive' user review rating, with 81% of over 6,000 user reviews marked as positive. IGN’sAssassin’s Creed Shadows reviewreturned an 8/10. We said: “By sharpening the edges of its existing systems, Assassin’s Creed Shadows creates one of the best versions of the open-world style it’s been honing for the last decade.”

"Assassin’s Creed Shadowssaw over 1 million players on launch day, Ubisoft has announced.

The game released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on March 20, and just before 4pm in Canada,Ubisoft took to social mediato say it had crossed the 1 million player mark.
“It's not even 4pm here in Canada and Assassin's Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players!” Ubisoft said.
“Thank YOU from the bottom of our hearts for joining this adventure in Feudal Japan. We are beyond excited to start this journey with you!”
While 1 million players on launch day is an impressive achievement, it’s difficult to gauge success when Ubisoft itself hasn’t offered a sales figure or indeed a sales target.
What we do know is that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the top-selling video game globally on Steam right now. Valve’s chart sorts products by revenue, so we can say Ubisoft’s game is currently bringing in more money than any other on the platform.
We also have early days Steam concurrent figures. According to official stats from Valve’s platform, Assassin’s Creed Shadows hit a peak player concurrent figure of 41,412 on Steam on launch day. Assassin’s Creed Shadows released on a Thursday, so it is expected that that figure will grow as we head into the game’s first weekend on sale. We’ll have a better picture of its performance on Steam next week and in the weeks ahead. Neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.
For some context, BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardlaunched on Steam on Thursday, October 31, 2024, and saw a peak of 70,414 players on Valve’s platform.

"Looking to score some killer discounts on top-tier games and gear? This week’s deals slash prices on some truly legendary titles across Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5. Let’s dive into the best of the bunch before they disappear.

In retro news, I'm lighting a 30th birthday cake forIndiana Jones' Greatest Adventures, a SNES treasure that belongs in your museum. Developed by Factor 5 and published by JVC/LucasArts, this SNES gem took the tried-and-trueSuper Star Warsformula and applied it toRaiders of the Lost Ark,The Temple of Doom, andThe Last Crusade. With tight controls, detailed sprite work, and a John Williams-fueled chiptune soundtrack, this was a must-have for 16-bit adventurers.
Back in the day, it was pretty amazing stuff to become Indy as he punched, whipped, and jumped his way through jungles, temples, mines, and deserts—all while avoiding Nazis, cultists, and booby traps. The level variety was impressive, with bonus segments including mine cart chases, boulder dashes, and even some Mode7 dogfighting in a biplane.

"Indiana Jones and the Great Circlehas a PlayStation 5 rating onthe website of the Entertainment Software Rating Board, suggesting a release date isn’t too far away.

MachineGames’ well-received action adventure game launched on Xbox Series X and S and PC in December 2024, and currently has a spring 2025 release window on PS5. That suggests the game will be out at some point in the next few months.
Microsoft has so far remained quiet on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s PS5 release date, preferring to focus on other games at its recent Xbox Developer Direct showcase. But it seems an announcement will be made soon.
MachineGames has issued a series of updates since the game’s initial Xbox launch,most recently fixing various bugs and adding support for Nvidia DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Ray Reconstruction on PC. The PS5 version will of course feature all the console updates released to date.
Boosted by launching day one on Game Pass, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has so farreached 4 million players— a figure that will no doubt see a significant boost one the PS5 version goes live.
Indiana Jones actor Harrison Ford has saidTroy Baker playing the beloved character in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is proof ""you don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul.""
Ford discussed alleviating control of Indy withThe Wall Street Journal, saying he was very happy with the performance of The Last of Us actor Baker.
""You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul,"" Ford said. ""You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent. He did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.""

"PlayStation or Xbox? It’s the long-running question of the modern video game world. At one point or another in your life, you’ve almost certainly been a part of this debate. Maybe you’ve started a Reddit thread, or made a TikTok video, or struck up a heated chat between friends about it. While therearegamers who preach the PC gospel, and Nintendo-as-god fanatics, much of the last two decades of video game history has been made as a result of Sony and Microsoft’s ongoing tete-a-tete. But is this ‘console war’ truly still being waged? The video game industry has gone through immense change in the last year, let alone over the previous two decades. Gamers’ habits, preferences, and options have all increased exponentially in part thanks to the rise of handheld gaming and younger generations’ expertise in building their own gaming machines. The battlefield is now practically unrecognisable compared to its tribal-like origins, but has a victor finally emerged from the trenches? Possibly – but the answer may surprise you.

The video game industry has rapidly evolved to become a financial juggernaut in recent years. In 2019, its worldwide revenue was $285 billion. Last year, it was $475 billion. That figure means that video games made more than the entire world wide movie and music industries in 2023, which made$308 billionand$28.6 billionrespectively. There’s no sign of this growth stopping, either. By 2029, the industry is estimated to generate nearly$700 billion. Not bad considering its humble Pong origins.
All this considered, it’s no surprise that we’ve seen an uptick in Hollywood actors flocking to be a part of a scene with such a lucrative present and future. Mads Mikkelsen, Keanu Reeves, Jon Bernthal and Willem Dafoe to name a few have all starred in games released in the past five years. Their involvement reflects the monumental shift in the perception of video games. Even industry titans like Disney are making significant in-roads into gaming, havingjust invested $1.5 billion into Epic Gamesas part of Bob Iger’s second term challenge to solidify a gaming presence for the company. A rising tide should lift all boats – unless you’re aboard the U.S.S. Microsoft, which seems to have sprung a leak.
The Xbox Series X and S consoles are intended to be an upgrade from the Xbox One in every way. But their advancements have yet to prove truly enticing; the One currently ranks above the Series X/S by almost double the sales. When you couple this fact with comments from analytics company Circana’s games industry expert, Mat Piscatella, who hassuggested that this current console generation is now past its selling peak, it paints a worrying picture for team Xbox. Things appear even worse when you look at console sales figures from 2024. According to Statista, the Xbox Series X/Ssold less than 2.5 million units across the entire year– the PlayStation 5sold the same figure in the first quarter of 2024 alone. There are also the allegations that Xbox is supposedly closing down its department which handles the manufacture and delivery of games to physical retailers, which feels ominously connected to itsevasive responseto areport that it plans to pull out of selling consoles in the EMEA region. If Xbox really has been involved in a ‘console war’, all of this points to the signal to retreat.
But Xbox isn't retreating – it has already surrendered. During the long Activision-Blizzard acquisition process, a statement from Microsoft found in the findings of fact revealed that the company doesn’t believe its Xbox division lost the console war –it thinks it never had a shot to begin with. So, what does a company built around a video game console do when its newest model is struggling to match its predecessor in sales, and its parent company openly remarks on its failure? It gets out of the console business.
It's no secret that Xbox Game Pass has become a key priority for the company.Leaked internal documentsrevealed the estimated prices Xbox expected to be asked to pay to put AAA-titles like Grand Theft Auto 5 ($12-15 million per month) and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor ($300 million) on the subscription service. Xbox taking such costs seriously demonstrates the company consolidating cloud gaming as a key direction for it moving forward. That goal is clear to see in Microsoft’s recent ‘This Is An Xbox’ advertising campaign, which suggests the company is keen to redefine how players think of Xbox – no longer a console, but an always-accessible service with some hardware to complement it instead.
It seems like this rethinking of what an Xbox is means that the brand’s official hardware won’t be limited to being a box under your TV. An Xbox handheld has been rumored to be in development for the past year or so, backed by another leaked document from the Activision-Blizzard dealings which hints at using handheld-friendly hardware for a next-gen'hybrid cloud gaming platform'. But Microsoft’s pivot in strategy has hardly been a secret. From its announcement of plans to createa mobile game storeto compete with Apple and Google, to Xbox chief Phil Spencer’s own admission that mobile gaming’s dominance in the sphere is shaping the company’s own path moving forward, the new M.O. seems simple: Xbox is the video game brand you can play whenever you want, wherever you are.
So why is Microsoft pivoting? Sure, Xbox has struggled over the past couple of generations, but doesn’t the video game console market reign supreme? You’d be surprised. In 2024, of the total 3.3 billion estimated video gamers,over 1.93 billion of them play via a mobile device. That, of course, includes your grandmother playing Candy Crush Saga and your “non-gamer” cousin who still clocks up hours of Clash of Clans. But mobile gaming is now so much more than these casual audiences – over the last decade it has quickly become the dominant pillar of the video game market among every generation, but especially Gen Z and Gen Alpha. In 2024, thetotal market valuation for the video game industrywas $184.3 billion, with mobile games comprising exactly half of that entire figure at $92.5 billion (a 2.8% increase from the previous year). Where do consoles weigh in? At just $50.3 billion, or 27%, and that’s dropped 4% since 2023. No wonder Microsoft wants to turn your phone into an Xbox.
But this isn’t a new development. By 2013, the Asian market for mobile gaming was already dwarfing that of the western world by heights of 759% in South Korea and 280% in China. You might think GTA 5 was the most profitable game of 2013, but you’d be wrong: Both Puzzle & Dragon and Candy Crush Saga outperformed Rockstar’s juggernaut by $1.5 and $1.4 billion respectively. Take a wide-angle lens to the 2010s as a whole for video games, and you’ll find that five of the highest-grossing games were mobile games – Crossfire, Monster Strike, Honor of Kings, Puzzle & Dragon, and Clash of Clans. When you look back on the decade, I highly doubt any of these titles immediately spring to mind – and yet, I’m sure most reading this have the start-up music for Clash of Clans seared into their brains.
Phones are not the only platform drawing attention away from consoles. While not as significant as mobile gaming’s explosion, it’s clear to see that player habits have shifted toward a greater appreciation for PC gaming. Since 2014, there has been a year-on-year growth of 59 million new PC players, taking us from 1.31 billion in 2014 to1.86 billion in 2024. It’s worth noting this rise is complimented by a gargantuan 200 million in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic, during which streaming became a very attractive pastime for many house-bound players. But regardless of if Twitch called to them or not, gamers have become more technologically literate, educated by their peers online on how to build a PC powerhouse, what the best GPUs are, and how to overclock your circuit-ware. As a result, the PC’s global share of the video game market in 2024 lands at $41.5 billion – so it won’t be long until the PC battleline overtakes the army of console players, right? Well, maybe not.Netzoo’s 2016 Global Games Market Value reportdefined a $2.3 billion gap between console and PC – but in 2024, that gap has increased to $9 billion. So despite the rise of more advanced GPUs, circuit-boards, and Gen Z and Alpha’s technological craftiness, it’s a market that’s on thefallrather than the rise – at least for now. If that fall continues, it's not great news for Xbox, which has made Windows PCs its second home.
But it’s not just the dominance of mobile and the uncertain future of PC that Xbox has to contend with. Wars typically have two opposing sides, so it’s about time we looked at where PlayStation fits into this console war. Luckily for Sony, things are going pretty well. In its latest quarterly earnings report, Sony revealed75 million PS5s have been sold to date– that’s a big lead ahead of the combined 29.7 million sales for the Xbox Series X/S. The gap between the two consoles is widening, too; stats suggest that for every one Xbox Series X/S bought during November 2024,five PlayStation 5 consoles were also purchased(a ratio no doubt helped by the launch of the PS5 Pro.) Sony’s Game and Network Services also saw a healthy 12.3% bump in its profits during the final months of 2024, helped specifically by healthy first-party sales including Astro Bot selling 1.5 million copies in under two months, and lifetime sales for Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut surpassing 13 million. The future looks very bright for the PS5. Ampere Analysis’ games research director, Piers Harding-Rolls,estimates that by 2029, Sony will have sold 106.9 million consoles. How do things look for the Xbox Series X/S’s future? Well, leaked Microsoft documents estimate that by 2027,it expects to have sold around 56-59 million units. While it’s not a directly comparable projection, it’s not good. In order for Microsoft to re-establish its competitive edge in the current market, it will need to close the 5:1 PlayStation-to-Xbox gap, significantly increase the number of units sold year-on-year, and also bolster the profitability of its exclusives. Projections don’t support a positive outcome for those first two requirements, and given Phil Spencer’s ‘no red lines’ mantra on Xbox titles coming to PlayStation and Switch (possibly even including the next Halo title), the argument could be made that PlayStation is already the King of Console.
But looking at the PS5 in isolation paints a different picture. 50% of all PlayStation users arecurrently still playing on older PS4sinstead of PS5s, despite the newest generation now entering the second half of its life-cycle. Why is this? Well, of the top 20 best-selling games in the U.S. in 2024, only one is truly PS5-exclusive – Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, at #19. Helldivers 2 does feature at #3 but was also playable on PC at launch. Looking beyond last year, if we disregard remasters of PS4 games, there are roughly 15 genuine PS5-exclusive games on the console as a whole. There’s little here to justify the console’s price in many people’s eyes.
If the PS5 is struggling to justify its regular $500 price tag, then it's understandable why the $700 PS5 Pro debuted to a mixed reception to say the least. The general consensus amongst tech journalists is that perhaps this upgrade came tooearlywithin the cycle, especially given the games advertised in its campaign were slightly upscaled generation-old remasters. WhenIGN polled its readers, the result was overwhelmingly clear – the PS5 Pro has little to offer for forking over that much cash. So, simply put, the PS5 simply isn’t a must-buy console – at least, not yet. This will undoubtedly change when the behemoth that is Grand Theft Auto 6 finally releases later this year, which is almost guaranteed to become the shining star of this generation and the first chance for the PS5 to show off its true power.
So, is the console war over? If you’re Microsoft, it would appear there was never any belief that there was a chance to battle Sony for supremacy. If you’re Sony, your new console has become a success but lacks the true pedigree to be claimed as a new leap forward yet, feeling more like a bunny hop than anything else. The true winner of the console war seems to be those who chose not to play it at all. Rumors of mobile gaming companies encroaching onto the traditional console gaming sphere will only ramp up in the years to come, with Tencent rumored to be in talks to buy out Ubisoft from the Guillemot brothers, having already purchased Sumo Group in 2021. Mobile gaming is becoming increasingly pivotal to the sustainability and profitability of these companies – Take-Two Interactive claim that 10% of the world’s population plays its subsidiary Zynga’s games every month. That means that it’s more than likely that your grandma playing Zynga Poker and Words with Friends 2 is funding the continued development of Grand Theft Auto 6 – not a sentence you would expect to read five years ago, but one reflective of the new state of play of the video game market. The next five years of video gaming history will be defined less and less by who has the most powerful hardware, and more about whose cloud gaming server farm can expand the quickest and strongest. The console war is over, but the mobile gaming war (and the myriad of smaller conflicts that inevitably spin out of it) has only begun.

"Bethesda has announced that MachineGames’Indiana Jones and The Great Circlelaunches on PlayStation 5 on April 15 for early access ahead of a global release on April 17. Those whopre-ordergetaccess to the early access.

The PS5 release date, which comes four months after Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launched on Xbox and PC, was announced alongside a playful promo trailer that sees perhaps the two most famous video game actors in the world on-screen together.
In the trailer, Indiana Jones actor Troy Baker sits down for a chat with Uncharted star Nolan North, who famously plays intrepid explorer Nathan Drake in the PlayStation-exclusive series. Drake and the Uncharted series are of course heavily inspired by Indiana Jones, so this meeting of the actors who play the characters is a full circle moment for The Great Circle itself.
There’s an added layer here, which is the Microsoft-owned Bethesda has drafted in Nolan North, the actor behind the Sony-owned franchise Uncharted, for a chinwag in one of its adverts. Now, at no point does North say ‘Nathan Drake’ or ‘Uncharted’ or anything that might legally belong to Sony Computer Entertainment, but his delivery in the video is knowing indeed.
Drake — I mean North — playfully suggests he broke into the lavishly decorated room in which he’s sat and so doesn’t have much time to talk. The suggestion here is goons might burst through the door at any moment, as they tend to do when Nate is rummaging through drawers on the hunt for clues.
North asks Baker how he’s going to deal with Private Military Forces with just a whip. Baker points to his head, saying, “use the old—” “headbutt,” North interjects. “I like it. Aggressive.” North says he’s “more of a sidearms kinda guy… jeans… henley,” and, as Baker quips, “somehow always half-tucked.”
Both North and Baker then bond over a shared enthusiasm for ancient artefacts, although North wants to sell them to the highest bidder, while Baker wants to donate them to a museum. This is Nathan Drake accepting the new Indiana Jones into a “very exclusive club” of adventurers. “Welcome to the club,” North declares. Xbox’s Indiana Jones now sits proudly alongside PlayStation’s Uncharted on Sony’s console, treasure-hunters in crime. All that’s left is for Lara Croft to break through the window and say something about not wanting the boys to have all the fun.
This is all part of Microsoft’s now-established multiplatform push, which has already seen a number of Xbox games launch on rival consoles. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is just the latest to make the jump, with Playground’s Forza Horizon 5, Id Software’s Doom: The Dark Ages and, reportedly, many more Microsoft-made games not far behind.
Boosted by launching day one on Game Pass, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has so farreached 4 million players— a figure that will no doubt see a significant boost once the PS5 version goes live.
Indiana Jones actor Harrison Ford has saidTroy Baker playing the beloved character in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is proof ""you don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul.""

"Deep discounts can be found on tons of thebest PlayStation Portal accessoriesthanks toAmazon’s Big Spring Sale, and today is the final day to save. From cases and screen protectors to docks and headphones, these items either enhance your playing experience or help protect Sony’s remote player. Right now, many accessories are 10% to over 40% off, bringing the lowest prices of 2025 so far. Chances are good you won’t see savings like these for at least another few months, so now is the time to buy.

Sure, thePlayStation Portalmay not be as portable as the name suggests, as it relies on a strong Wi-Fi signal to stream games. Still, if you’ve got a good connection, you can take the device just about anywhere. Plus, thePlayStation Portal now supports cloud gamingvia a PlayStation Plus subscription, so a PS5 is no longer required to play.
If you’ve been hesitant to buy the gaming handheld in the past, this added functionality brings more value. You can evengrab the PlayStation Portal in a new Midnight Blackcolorway, and then be sure to get some discounted accessories to go with it, since only a USB-C to USB-C charging cable comes in the box.
With a large and sharp 8-inch LCD screen and Dual Sense style controls, the PS Portal is susceptible to damage. An accidental drop or too much pressure in a bag could end up bricking the pricey remote player, making a case a high priority.
Orzly’s caseis one of thebest PlayStation Portal casesyou can grab. It perfectly matches the device’s dimensions for a snug fit, offers a padded section for accessories, and comes with a hard shell for extra protection, and the case is $15 off during Amazon’s sale. Want something a little less expensive? There’s a great deal at the moment on a durablecase from FYOUNGwith similar features to the Orzly case. If you need something extra tough, theSTARTRC GAMES Carrying Caseis designed to take on a little more wear and tear than your average hard shell case. It’s also on sale.
A zippered hard shell case won’t protect the PlayStation Portal when you’re actually playing a game. So, those with butter fingers might want to consider some additional protection. A screen protector is a great way to prevent cracks to the precious display when the device falls from your grip, and our favoritetwo-pack of screen protectors from ivolerhappens to be a part of Amazon’s sale. Speaking of grip, a form-fitting case, likethis discounted option from Qoosea, gives you a better handle on the device while wrapping it with an extra layer of protection against scratches, dust, and more.
Rather than buying each accessory individually to keep the PlayStation Portal safe in various situations, plenty of accessory sets are on sale during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. These kits come with a hard shell case for travel and storage, a form-fitting cover for protection while you play, and screen protectors to keep scratches to the screen at bay. Some go even further, offering thumbstick covers and extra space for SD cards, cords, and more.
While most PlayStation Portal accessories focus on protection, a couple others are worth the investment to make life with the device even better.
You'll want a pair ofgreat gaming earbudsto keep games distraction free, andTurtle Beach’s Battle Budsare currently discounted. Yes, these are wired because the PlayStation Portal does not support Bluetooth audio. Wireless headsets require PlayStation Link support. Unfortunately, we’re not seeing any major discounts on the few options that do offer PlayStation’s proprietary wireless.
A charging dock is another sound purchase, as you’ll need something to top up the remote player after its 7 to 9 hours of battery life runs out. A charging dock provides a secure place to store your device as it charges. Our favorite charging dock, theFYoung Charging Dock Stationis on sale, and beyond charging the Portal in 3.5 hours, it adds some visual flair to your space with 14 customizable color options. Asimilar option from LVVILis also on sale.

The PS Portal, Sony's handheld gaming accessory for the PS5 console, looks very much like an extended split-pad DualSense controller with an 8-inch 1080p LCD screen in the middle of it. It turns your PS5 into a gaming handheld by letting you stream games from your console at up to 60fps. The controller mirrors the same features found on the DualSense, including haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and a touchscreen interface that replaces the Dualsense's touchpad. The Portal can stream your games even when you're outside of your home, with the caveat that you have access tovery stable, very fastinternet connection. Keep in mind that the PS Portal is not a standalone device. This is strictly a remote player for the PlayStation 5, so you will need a PS5 to use it.
Update:You no longer need a PS5 to play games on the PS Portal. Now, rather than being limited to simply streaming games from a $500 console to a $200 handheld, Sony has introduced a feature that lets owners stream games directly from its PlayStation Now cloud streaming service. No PS5 required. Portal owners now have the option to either connect the Portal to their PS5 as before, or directly to Sony’s cloud servers. Choose the latter and suddenly you have access to a library of more than 120 games, including Ghost of Tsushima, Resident Evil 3 Remake, The Last of Us Part 1 Remastered, and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.It’s worth noting you must be a subscriber to the highest tier of PlayStation Plus, but $18 a month is much more attractive that splashing out $500 upfront plus an extra $70 a game.
It should be said that the PlayStation Portal isn’t the only way to stream your PS5 games over Wi-Fi within your home. You can mimic its functionality by downloading the PS Remote Play app on a mobile device, including other gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck.  That said, it's more complicated to set up and you'll lose out on some of the Dualsense's features.
PlayStation Portal Reviewby Seth Macy
""The PlayStation Portal is the most surprising device I've ever come away from loving after going in loaded with skepticism. It's such a better experience than using your phone with a slap-on controller, and it works so much better than I was anticipating. I really love the freedom it gives me to play my PS5 from anywhere with decent WiFi coverage, especially when the rest of my family was using the TV to (somewhat ironically) play the Switch. Bearing in mind that it’s in no way a stand-alone device and 100% requires a PlayStation 5 to function at all, the biggest things keeping the Portal from being a truly amazing device are its current lack of a way to access WiFi that requires a web browser to log in, and its lack of Bluetooth support for audio. For now, it's a great device that represents the best current solution for PlayStation Remote Play, and if it weren't for those two baffling caveats, I'd call this a must-own device for every PS5 owner who enjoys playing games on handheld – or has to compete for the household TV.""

Astro Bot Reviewby Simon Cardy
""Astro Bot made me smile from beginning to end. A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive. And while you don’t need a long history with Sony systems to enjoy it, it is especially a delight for those with a piece of PlayStation in their heart as a treasure trove full of playable nostalgia awaits. Taking the PS5 marketing mantra that “play has no limits” more seriously than you’d expect, Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it.""

"Sony has confirmed The Last of Us Part II Remastered PC specs ahead of its April 3 release date, PSN sign-in incentives, and announced new content coming to No Return Mode across PC and PlayStation 5.

In a post on thePlayStation Blog, developer Naughty Dog listed the features that support studios Nixxes Software and Iron Galaxy helped bring to the PC version of The Last of Us Part II Remastered, which arrives a year after the PlayStation 5 version.
There’s also support for Ultrawide monitors, so you can play in 21:9 ultra-wide, 32:9 super ultra-wide, and even 48:9 resolutions with compatibility for triple-monitor setups.
As you’d expect, you can play in 4K resolution, with various supported controllers as well as keyboard and mouse controls. There’s 3D audio, too.
Keyboard and mouse control support includes new control customization options, including full control remapping, primary and secondary bindings for keyboard and mouse control, and an adaptive mode that allows players to combine keyboard and controller inputs. There’s full gamepad support, while DualSense controllers feature full haptic feedback.
“The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC offers a wide range of graphics settings and presets, to ensure the best possible experience on hardware ranging from high-end PCs to handheld gaming devices,” Sony said.
Moving on to No Return mode, two new characters are being added: The Last of Us Part I’s Bill and Marlene.
Here’s the official blurb from Sony:
Four new maps are coming to No Return, too.
All the new No Return content, plus accompanying new Trophies and additional bug fixes, will be available on PS5 day-and-date with the PC launch via a free downloadable 2.0.0 patch, Sony added.
In keeping withSony’s recent PlayStation Network requirement U-turn, The Last of Us 2 Remastered on PC has an optional PSN log-in. But if you do log in to PSN, you get PlayStation overlay and PSN Trophies. As an extra incentive, Sony said those who sign in with their PSN account also get access to 50 in-game points to activate bonus features, as well as a new skin for Ellie featuring Jordan A. Mun’s jacket from Naughty Dog’s new PS5 game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.
PS5 players will also be able to unlock the Jordan’s jacket skin, Sony clarified. It’s included in the 2.0 patch and unlockable via in-game bonus points.
Earlier this month, The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann shared more details aboutIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. In aninterviewwith Alex Garland, the writer of zombie movie 28 Days Later, Druckmann talked candidly about the development process, confirming Intergalactic has been in the works for four years.
""I joke about this with the team. We made a game,The Last of Us 2, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game,"" Druckmann said, to which Garland joked: ""Who gives a shit?""
""Exactly,"" Druckmann added. ""But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about — let's make a game about faith and religion.""
Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which stars Tati Gabrielle as Jordan A. Mun, takes place in an alternate historical timeline and features a ""pretty prominent religion"" that has ""changed and bastardized and evolved"" over the years, Druckmann said.
The PC version of The Last of Us 2 Remastered arrives ahead of Season 2 of HBO's hit TV adaptation. Showrunners Druckmann and Craig Mazin have confirmed“spores are back” following their omission from Season 1.

"In 2012, Assassin’s Creed 3 director Alex Hutchinson called out people on the internet for suggesting the most “boring” future settings for the series. “The three most wanted [settings for Assassin’s Creed] are WWII, feudal Japan and Egypt,” he explained at the time, adding “They’re kind of the three worst settings for an AC game.” Hutchinson later clarified his statement, saying “the point I was trying to make was that in the broad strokes and scale of history, that’s a theme that’s been well-mined in video games.” He’s not wrong and since he made his most recent comments, Ghost of Tsushima, Rise of the Ronin, Nioh and more have all shone a spotlight on feudal Japan.

Fast-forward to 2025 and Assassin’s Creed is finally going to one of these “worst” settings with Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, but Shadows director Jonathan Dumont believes his team has found a new way to tell the story of feudal Japan.
""I think it's not boring at all. The setting is very exciting,"" Dumont says when asked about Hutchinson’s quote. ""I do think that being able to bring it to life and have that balance of the political intrigue [of the era], the war and conflict, and also the beauty of nature and supporting more exploration within this changing world give it another dimension [compared to other games].""
Hutchinson wasn’t wrong back in 2012. The setting of Feudal Japan has indeed been one of the most requested locations for the Assassin's Creed series. Bringing the series' unique blend of historical fiction and sci-fi to the backdrop of warring states and samurai in fierce conflict seemed like a no-brainer for developer Ubisoft to make happen sooner rather than later. The only problem was Ubisoft chose later, perhaps to its detriment.
Though Ubisoft has been praised for exploring previously overlooked historical settings like Egypt and Industrial Revolution England, other developers have beaten Ubisoft to open-world stealth-action games set in Japan with titles like Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Tsushima. That said, shows like FX’s Shogun prove that people’s appetites for samurai action hasn’t waned in the least. Much like Shogun, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows explores how outsiders navigate the courts and politics of feudal Japan. And the Assassin’s Creed name has a built-in reputation all on its own.
Dumont highlights the conflict and historical impact of the era – particularly in how Japan was ""opened up"" to the rest of the world for the first time following the arrival of Portuguese merchants and missionaries during the late 1500s Sengoku era.
""What made the setting interesting for us to tackle was the political landscape of the time, along with the arts and the environment of that era. We've seen other games do it before, but not in the Assassin's Creed way that we're doing it,"" says Dumont. ""We also have that big open-world feeling with the big cities, the wilderness, and we really touch upon the historical arts and the reconstruction of these locations to make it real for that time. So I don't think we've seen that necessarily in a lot of games [covering this era] – to truly explore and bring you into that world.”
According to Dumont, the political intrigue of the era made it a particularly compelling setting to tackle for Assassin's Creed. A key difference he highlights that makes Shadows different from other games is how it brings a more dynamic and deeper dive into a politically troubled era filled with conflict – one that players will be able to immerse themselves in and learn more about almost from the moment the game begins.
There is also the matter of new technology that Ubisoft utilized in order to bring its version of Japan to life.
""The team was very enthusiastic about Assassin's Creed's take on Feudal Japan, and we felt that the latest technological improvements and new consoles would help us bring that vision to life,"" says Dumont. He highlights the dynamic weather and seamless open-world, and according to our review, the team seemingly succeeded in creating one of the best historical locations in Assassin’s Creed history.
Remember, the Assassin’s Creed series began during the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 era, and since then technology has come a long way, with 4K resolution, bigger open worlds with greater density, and ray-tracing now standard on consoles and PC.
""What that does is give a much more 'alive' feeling than what we've done in the past [with other games],"" he continues. ""So I think that technology that took a few years to develop is omnipresent and all around you within the game. It does bring another dimension of being able to see the world in different states – which gives it more depth. It would not have been possible to make Shadows without our current technology; I don't think we would have gotten that feeling of losing ourselves in this open world without it.""
What makes the Assassin's Creed series so compelling is how it takes historical settings and injects its patented stealth-action gameplay and open-world immersion to make them all the more engrossing. Assassin's Creed Shadows leans into the samurai and ninja fantasy, much like other games tackling this setting. And the need to one-up the competition presented a big challenge to ensure the game's scope was well realized – and given the lengthy wait for the series to tackle a Japan setting, Dumont felt the wait was worth it.
“It's really all about keeping the vision there, and the team keeps pushing for better quality in every aspect,” he says. “There's always a challenge with trying to meet people's expectations, and we also put the pressure on ourselves to do the best we can.""

"The modder who releaseda playable recreation of the Grand Theft Auto 6 map in Grand Theft Auto 5has ceased all work on the project after being hit by a takedown from Rockstar owner Take–Two.

‘Dark Space’ had created a free-to-download playable GTA 5 map based on leaked coordinate data and official trailer shots of GTA 6, and uploaded gameplay footage to his YouTube channel. His videos and his mod hit the headlines in January as information-starved GTA fans flocked to experience a fan-made approximation of what they can expect to play officially when GTA 6 launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S this fall.
Then, last week, Dark Space received the dreaded strike notification from YouTube after Take-Two issued a copyright removal request. If a YouTube channel receives multiple copyright strikes, it runs the risk of being terminated.
In response, Dark Space removed all download links to his mod, despite the fact he has yet to be asked to do so by Take-Two, and publisheda response videoon his channel calling out the company for its actions and suggesting it was the result of the mod's take on GTA 6's map being ""probably a little too accurate.""
Dark Space was more philosophical in a follow-up interview with IGN. “I expected this would happen based on their past takedowns,” the modder said. “I went into this project knowing it was a possibility, and the fact that it happened does not surprise me.”
Dark Space said he believes Take-Two went after his mod because it was based on an online GTA 6 community mapping project that uses leaked coordinate points to “perfectly” map out the upcoming virtual space, and as a result might have ruined the surprise for players and the internet at large.
“That's probably the biggest red flag, although most of the work in my map was based on the trailer shots,” Dark Space added.
“I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get. If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too.”
The upshot is Dark Space’s GTA 6 mod project is no more. And that’s not just for YouTube videos of it, that’s for the entire thing. “Well they clearly do not want this project to exist,” Dark Space said. “So it's not just under threat, it's eliminated. There’s no point putting more time into something that goes directly against what they’re willing to allow.
“I'm just going to keep making videos that people hopefully like. I probably won't do anything else modding GTA 5 in relation to GTA 6, since it seems dangerous.”
There are now concerns that the GTA 6 community mapping project could be next in Take-Two’s sights. IGN has contacted the group for comment.
Take-Two has a history of taking down fan projects, most recentlythe YouTube channel belonging to the makers of the ‘GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition,’which ports the world, cutscenes, and missions from 2002’s Vice City into 2008’s GTA 4.
One former Rockstar developer has defended the company’s actions here, saying both Take-Two and Rockstar are protecting their business interests.
“Take2/R* are a commercial company,” former Rockstar Games technical director Obbe Vermeijtweeted. “They will take down mods that interfere with their business interests.
“The VC NextGen Edition mod for GTA4 directly competes with the Definitive Edition. The Liberty City preservation project (GTA4 in GTA5 engine) would interfere with a possible GTA4 remaster. (No idea whether they’re working on that. I think they should.)
“There’s no point getting angry about it. This is what companies are supposed to do. The best we can hope for is that they allow mods that don’t interfere with their business. Such as DCA3 (GTA3 for Dreamcast). Afaik they have recently been decent about letting these projects continue.”
While you wait for GTA 6 to come out, check out IGN’s coverage of an ex-Rockstar dev who saysthe studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025, Take-Two boss StraussZelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out, and the expert opinion onwhether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second.

"Lenovo is offering the best deal right now on PlayStation 5 DualSense controllers. The Deep Earth Collection, which includes the metallicVolcanic Red,Cobalt Blue, andSterling Silver. colorways are on sale for $54 after you apply coupon code:PLAY5in your shopping cart. That's about 33% off and better thanAmazon's Spring Sale.

Lenovo might not be the first store you'd think of for great deals on PlayStation controllers, but surprisingly, no one can match their pricing. This might be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, at least untilSony's PlayStation Days of Play Salethat will probably happen sometime in late May.
The original PS5 DualSense controller is decked out in the same white color scheme as the console itself and retails for $69.99. Since then,Sony has consistently released more and more colors, some of them more striking than others. In late 2023, Sony launched theDeep Earth collection, ""a new metallic colorway for PS5 accessories"" with aptly sounding names like Sterling Silver, Volcanic Red, and Cobalt Blue. These controllers retailed for $79.99 and were (and still are) one of the more striking color schemes. We rarely see these on sale compared to the other colors.
Color aside, the Dualsense is oft regarded as thebest PS5 controller under $100. It also makes for an excellent controller for your PC. The DualSense is modeled after the tried and true design and layout of previous PlayStation controllers, but it also packs in modern features such as haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone and speaker, integrated touchpad, internal gyroscope and accelerometer for motion sensing, and USB Type-C charging.

"LG's most popular current generation OLED TV has been discounted starting today. Right now Amazon has dropped the price of the65"" LG Evo C4 4K OLED TVto $1,396.99. The LG Evo C-series of TVs - including this model - have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVsfor HDR movie watching and current generation console gaming.

The C4 is the 2024 model in LG's C-series OLED lineup. The LG Evo C5 hasn't yet been released, butit was showcased during CES 2025. At least on paper, the improvements of the C5 seem to be incremental, with no major ground breaking updates that would make you want to hold off until its launch. More importantly, the C5 will probably release at a very high retail price which will take months to get down to a level that's competitive with other TV deals.
The C4 uses LG's Evo panel, which offers higher brightness levels than traditional OLED TVs. Compared to a standard LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. Because of these advantages, the Evo OLED TV excels at displaying 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations.
The LG C4 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz and all four HDMI ports are 2.1 spec for running games in 4K at up to 120fps on a PS5 or Xbox Series X without any tearing. The C4 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM). The C4 is also easier to install than its predecessors; the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that weighs 36 pounds.
The LG Evo C-series TV is ourfavorite high-end 4K TV of 2025because of the brilliance of its OLED display along with a host of quality features that don't quite push it to the point of an excessively high price. This model brings better contrast and clarity than the previous year's already luminous LG C2. It’s a sight to behold, especially when you add in the deep blacks and well-balanced colors on the crisp 4K screen. Once you choose OLED, it's hard to go back to anything else.
If you bought a brand new TV over the holidays and you're looking for a good audio solution at an excellent price, then one of the best Black Friday deals is back.

At this price, it's certainly one of the best soundbars you can get, especially if you're looking for an affordable soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos.
If you don't mind going a generation back, you can pick up a 202365"" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TVfor just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday. The 2024 C4 has minimal incremental upgrades over the 2023 C3, with the most noticeable improvements being an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, support for DTS audio, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate.

"If you're in the market for a new PlayStation or Xbox console and bottom-line pricing is your utmost priority, check out these deals from AliExpress. You can get a brand new importedXbox Series XandPlayStation 5consoles for much lower than you can find a new model elsewhere. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming consoles that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by your account, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item. These consoles all ship locally from the United States and usually arrive within one week.

AliExpress as a whole is a legitimate website, but since it is a marketplace comprised of individual sellers, you have to make sure that the vendor you're buying from is reputable. In many cases, the easiest way to do so is to look at the seller's rating and history. In terms of the products we've listed in this article, while it's true that some of the sellers may not have many reviews,AliExpress has reached out to us and personally vetted these vendors, which is why we feel comfortable promoting them. AliExpress also offers a 15 to 90 day free return policy depending on the product.
AliExpress has dropped the price of the professional-grade Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Controller to only $74.42 shipped after you apply coupon code ""IFP3TXY""in cart. That's a huge price drop from its normal $140 list price and nearly the same cost as a standard Xbox controller. Note that this is a Hong Kong or Japanese import model in new retail packaging, but you won't find it cheaper anywhere else. Aside from the different color scheme, the Core controller is identical to the Xbox Elite Series 2 non-Core controller. The Core controller, however, does not include the component pack. AliExpress offers a 90-day return policy.
AliExpress also just dropped the price on a new retail boxed (imported) Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 wireless gaming controller – component pack included – to $100 shipped. This controller retails for $180 and the lowest price we've ever seen for this controller stateside is about $130-$140.
Lenovo has dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart. Lenovo might not be the first site you'd think of for great deals on PlayStation controllers, but surprisingly, no one can match their pricing. This might be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, at least untilSony's PlayStation Days of Play Salethat will probably happen sometime in late May.
SteelSeries is currently offering theArctis Nova 7 Dragon Editiongaming headset for only $119.99 after an $80 off instant discount. The Dragon Edition is identical to the Nova Arctis 7 in build quality and performance, but with the addition of a deep red colorway with decorative gold dragon accents in celebration of 2024's Year of the Dragon motif. Even though 2024 has passed, this is still one of SteelSeries' classier designs that doesn't feel outdated or out of place.
SteelSeries is also taking 35% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets. The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Destiny 2 in-game items.

"Control was IGN’s Game of the Year in 2019 – and I was one of the many editors that voted for it – but even I was skeptical when Remedy, a studio known for telling great single-player stories in third-person games, announced it was doing a Control multiplayer game. That project turned out to be FBC: Firebreak, a three-player PvE first-person multiplayer shooter set six years after the events of Control. And in the hands-off demo I saw, it very quickly became clear that my skepticism was completely unwarranted. Firebreak is refreshingly original in an oversaturated space, delightfully weird amidst a sea of same-y military and/or sci-fi online shooters, and perhaps best of all, it doesn’t require a massive commitment like so many of its contemporaries. As game director Mike Kayatta put it, ""We're not about daily check-ins. We're not interested in monthly grinds. We don't want to give anybody a second job."" Say it again, Mike, for the people in the back.

FBC: Firebreak is a three-player co-op FPS with, if what Remedy is promising comes to pass, no nonsense. You can play for 20 minutes or a few hours if you want to, with Perk unlocks and new combinations amongst characters keeping things fresh for repeat runs. But what the heck are you doing here, back in The Oldest House, with a bevy of bizarre weaponry in your hands? Essentially, you are volunteer first responders in The Oldest House when things go seriously sideways. Your characters are secretaries, rangers, and other “normal” occupations who heed the call of service. The Federal Bureau of Control wouldn’t say you’re expendable, but…you’re expendable.
When you log in to play, you choose a Job (aka a mission) and a Crisis Kit (essentially, your loadout) before setting the Threat Level (difficulty) and Clearance Level, which determines how many zones you'll be playing through in a run. The zones are separated by containment doors, which will take you to the next stage of the Job. And the Job I saw is called Paper Chase, and it’s set in a fairly mundane office section of the FBC building. The Hiss are spreading, and it’s up to you and your two teammates to work together to beat them back.
Of course, you can get the hell out of there as soon as you can if you like, but if you want to get your hands on currencies that let you upgrade and buy new gear, you have to escape safely with them. And the longer you spend exploring for currency, the harder it is to make it back to HQ in one piece.
Speaking of gear, that’s where FBC: Firebreak starts to set itself apart from other multiplayer shooters. Many of the guns are charmingly unusual, and most have a homebrew feel, like the hand-cranked snowball-launching gun that can put out fires (or your friends who are on fire) and soak the sticky-note monster (uh, more on him in a bit). Or the cobbled-together zapper that, when fitted with the right nozzle, can rain down lightning storms on a room full of bad guys. Or the large wrench that, when a squeaky piggy bank toy is attached, causes a swirl of coins to pelt your opponents. Don’t worry, though; there are still staples like a machinegun and shotgun – the latter of which is the go-to for after you’ve either soaked or zapped one of the sticky-note monsters.
Oh yes, about them: the entire point of this particular Job is to eliminate all of the sticky notes before they overrun the entire brutalist building. Note the number of sticky notes left to destroy in the upper left corner. It will actually go way up as the mission progresses because, by the end of it, you face off against…a gigantic sticky-note monster. Think Sandman from the end of Spider-Man 3, but made out of sticky Post-It notes instead of sand.
But it’s not just about weird weapons. There are also fun in-universe gameplay mechanics, too, like the office supply shelf that refills your ammo, the makeshift turret you build after literally dumping it out of a box onto the floor, the stereo speaker that keeps the Hiss at bay, and the rinse station that washes any aggressive sticky notes off of your face. Unlockable Perks also inject more spice and variety into the gameplay. A couple of examples I saw: a Perk where each missed bullet has a chance to return to your clip, and another that lets you extinguish yourself by jumping up and down. Also, if you get two of the same Perk you get a stronger version of it. If you get three, you can share the Perk’s effect with nearby teammates.
By the way, in case you’re wondering, you don’t have to have three people in order to play. You can play solo or in duos as well. Meanwhile, Remedy is aiming for a lower minimum PC spec than usual, but on the opposite end of the spectrum, FBC will also support DLSS4 with multi-frame generation as well as nVidia Reflex and full ray-tracing. It’ll also be Steam Deck verified, and it’s launching into Xbox and PC Game Pass on day one along with PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium. Finally, there is a post-launch content plan that Remedy isn’t ready to share quite yet, and there will be paid cosmetics, but that’s the extent of the microtransactions.
In fairness, I haven’t actually played FBC: Firebreak yet, so I have to be cautious about my enthusiasm. But so far, it certainly passes the eye test. This is almost certainly not a run-of-the-mill multiplayer shooter, in a very good way. And the fact that it’s a get-in and get-out online game that doesn’t require a massive ongoing time commitment in order to enjoy it is a refreshing throwback to the days when that was the norm.

"Although Bleach is the flashiest member of the shonen anime “big three,” standing shoulder to shoulder with mega-popular series like One Piece and Naruto, it has long suffered from middle child syndrome when it comes to arena fighter adaptations. Bleach Rebirth of Souls aims to break the cycle ofrun-of-the-mill anime fightersthis series has previously been part of, delivering a unique action game that attempts to raise the genre to greater heights. Its story mode is admittedly an uneven jumble, ricocheting back and forth between a laughable attempt at a visual novel cobbled together like a last-second afterthought and a visually striking and stylish spectacle, as Bleach should be. But developer Tamsoft's herculean effort to enrich Rebirth of Souls with complex combat (with some room for improvement) saves it from being just another fly-by-night arena fighter.

It’s easy to get overloaded by a bunch of confusing anime jargon as Rebirth of Souls’ tutorial explains how its health bar, counters, and super moves work, but here’s the quick way to understand things: This is a 3D arena fighter with Super Smash Bros.’s life stock system, Sekiro’s stance-breaking swordplay, and Bleach’s unique visual flair. Unlike other arena fighters, which often have combat so shallow you only need to find a single combo or spam super moves to win matches, Bleach's combat feels like a challenging game of tug-of-war – one where victories are clinched rather than mindlessly stomped out of your opponents.
Each sword swing feels snappy and weighty as you teleport around the screen, ambushing your enemies from behind and breaking their guard. It never gets old to see large blocks of text wrap around freeze-framed characters with every successfully landed counter and super move. Even when you play Rebirth of Souls on its Standard Mode button layout, which streamlines things by letting you dish out flashy auto-combos, it harbors a wink of complex and unique mechanics specific to each character that warrant further exploration. That could be Shinji's counter-heavy moveset or the in-your-face brawler style of my personal favorite, Soi Fon – it’s so satisfying to stun lock opponents whenever she zips all over the place with a flurry of punches and kicks. Plus, her super move is a massive missile arm canon that she has hunker down to fire, which is too enticing a contradiction to pass up as a main.
However, Standard Mode matches do have a samey button rhythm to them after a while without much expression outside of mashing light and heavy button combos into a super. Having two move inputs that double as a distance closer alongside often unreliable ranged attacks does not make for a remarkable competitive game. It also doesn't help that the movement feels oddly stiff, with slow dashes and a scarcity of defensive options. Typically, whenever you're getting your ass kicked, fighting games bail you out by filling up your meter that effectively allows you to take some pressure off with a flashy super or counter. Other arena fighters like Naruto and Dragon Ball get around these counter move deficits by giving you a dedicated button to charge your super bars or spend portions of your meter for last second teleportations to avoid disaster.
In contrast, outside of two defensive retaliation mechanics called Awakenings and Reversals (with the former activating as a late-game transformation to buff your damage), the only way to build your super move or flash step teleports in Rebirth of Soils is tied to having dealt enough combos in the first place. The limited defensive mechanics grow even more dire when successfully blocking an opponent's offensive onslaught can be immediately undone by them comboing into a guard breaker — which should be virtually unheard of in any self respecting fighting game.
All of the above makes the back and forth of Standard Mode matches a bit tiring as you wait for a flash step bar to come back or pray you don't get whiff punished into oblivion thanks to a weird attack range. Thankfully, playing Rebirth of Souls in Manual Mode alleviates a lot of the restrictiveness those training wheels can cause, giving you the ability to mix together (or cancel out of) a variety of light and heavy combos into metered special moves. That makes Manual feel like the “intended” way to play if you’re looking for a more serious fighter because you aren't limited to a light and heavy combo string with the occasional super move punctuation mark. Manual Mode allows you to cancel out combos on a dime and deliver an infinite string of attacks, letting you effectively express yourself as you learn what assortment of attacks will deal the most damage while looking good doing so. That said, it could still do with more optimization to things like sluggish dashes, inconsistent attack range hit confirmations, and a deficit of defensive movements to make matches feel less rigid and constrictive.
As a massive fan of the Bleach anime and manga's stunning artistry, stirring character development, and shocking plot twists, I had high hopes that Rebirth of Souls could deliver a worthwhile story mode. Sadly, it's a bit of a mixed bag. By and large, cutscenes in an anime fighter should act as a sparkly reward at the end of battle, meant to bring the momentum of a fight to a thrilling climax. At the best of times, like in theNaruto: Ultimate Ninja Stormseries, they can be so well animated that they could substitute for watching the actual shows. That is not always the case with Rebirth of Souls – if anything, they nearly bring things to a screeching and embarrassing halt where you're not sure if you're meant to laugh on purpose or not.
The look of combat clearly had a lot of tender love and care put into it, but the story moments between that action instead play out like a cheap visual novel. Outside of a few pre-rendered cutscenes, the SparkNotes version of the anime this story mode attempts to tell is a rushed, hobbled mess. Instead of being greeted by bombastic scenes where my favorite characters clash, I was met with Machinima-looking animations where in-game models would fart out energy waves at each other and stiffly fall to the ground. Even the emotionally heady scenes lose all sense of tension as its characters move around like clumsy action figures with limited points of articulation in bright, low-poly arenas. What's more, exciting moments like sword clashes and beam struggles lose all of their gravitas as these scenes incessantly cut to black with bright slashes on the screen that look less like a creative choice for dramatic effect and more like a placeholder for an animation that wasn’t added in time.
If this was a genuine attempt to resemble a visual novel, it definitely missed the mark, as it feels more like an unfinished first draft – and with review codes less than a day before launch, it’s hard not to see this as an intentional hope that fans will buy-in based solely on the goodwill of the franchise. Which is a shame, because both its English and Japanese voice cast are putting in work with their vocal performances and the character models are faithful recreations that do look great in action. As if Bandai Namco took pointers fromInvincible season 2’s jokeabout how animators cut corners to make more scenes, Rebirth of Souls put all of its focus on the fights, and every moment outside of them looks like a fan-made animator’s first crack at recreating the anime as a result.
At the same time, however, Tamsoft is weirdly able to weaponize its limited, awkward looking cutscenes to drive home the charm of Bleach's filler episodes. Moments of levity during a handful of original story mode chapters where characters take a break from slashing each other to play high-stakes games of soccer, go on haunted house dates, or rinse each other at fighting games have the right kind of jank to their slapstick animation. These periodic excursions are disarmingly charming to watch. Side characters who'd otherwise be ignored on Rebirth of Souls roster like Shuhei or Izuru get more dimension to them, encouraging you to invest time in learning how to play them because of how compelling and personable their slice-of-life segments are.
Bleach Rebirth of Souls’ combat surpasses the typical anime arena fighter thanks to its intricate battle system and the effort that has been invested in making each character feel unique with their distinct play styles. Although the theatrics of its story mode do not consistently match the spectacle of its crisp character models, the vibrant sword slashes and stylish typography accompanying each super move help compensate for those shortcomings. Despite not fully delivering on its ambitious promise to elevate anime arena fighters to new heights, Rebirth of Souls is still a welcome latecomer to the genre for this series."
"The story behind the Metal Gear Solid Board Game is nearly as wild as the plot of aMetal Gear game, featuring a mix of delays and licensing issues, with odds stacked against it ever seeing the light of day before being rescued (much like Solid Snake rescuing Gray Fox) by CMON Games. But at long last, this cardboard adaptation of the Hideo Kojima masterpiece has finally reached the masses. From sneaking around in cardboard boxes to dynamic and exciting boss fights, the game’s tactical stealth gameplay has successfully made the jump fromvideo games to board games. However, the whole package isn’t without its faults, leaving me feeling both satisfied and let down at the same time.

Metal Gear Solid: The Board Game is acampaign-style board gamethat retells the story of thefirst Metal Gear Solid game, originally released on the PlayStation in 1998. Designed for one to four players (at least according to the box; more on that below), the game has players move plastic miniature versions of series favorites like Meryl, Otacon, Cyborg Ninja Gray Fox, and Solid Snake himself through 14 scenarios featuring iconic moments from the game, such as the confrontation with Ocelot, changing the PAL Keycard, and, of course, taking out REX.
Unfortunately, there is one significant omission that didn’t make the cut: the final confrontations between Solid and Liquid are not recreated as playable scenarios. It’s a bummer that neither the barehanded fight on top of REX nor the Jeep escape is included. Perhaps the developers couldn’t find a way to balance or explain a 4v1 battle on REX or figure out how the escape would work with all present characters. Instead, they've opted to end on the high note of a dramatic and memorable team-up against Metal Gear REX. But in the meantime, the fan community around this game has you covered. Over onBoardGameGeek, user @Geoff907and their wife devised and published their own unique Stage 15 for this game for you to try out, if you just absolutely need to get some of that shirtless fist-fight action into your game.
If you opt for the more expensive “Integral Edition,” the rest of the story bits that aren't told through gameplay are instead presented in a striking 109-page graphic novel with art by comic artist Kenneth Loh. It's reminiscent of the scenes in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker or the Digital Graphic Novels on PSP. But MGS wouldn’t be MGS without its CODEC calls. These little burst transmissions between Snake and his support team have been faithfully adapted to this new format, with prompts directing players to specific calls in the included Codec Book, as well as pre and post-scenario briefings. I particularly appreciate the care the developers have taken to make them just as campy yet informative as those in the video game. For example, Snake refers to how many actions he can take or offers tips on beating Psycho Mantis involving “Player 2”-like trickery. Even as a game made of cardboard and dice, this still feels distinctly Metal Gear.
Regarding gameplay, players take up to four actions per turn, chosen from those listed on their character’s unique player boards. As scenarios progress, players unlock new equipment, from Snake’s favorite sidearm, the Socom, to the iconic cardboard box, which can be used in future scenarios. This equipment expands each character’s skill pool, effectively replicating the video game’s “procure on-site” philosophy. Once players take their actions, it’s time for the enemies to act. Both generic guards and bosses have action cards that dictate their movements and behaviors, which can change depending on whether they’ve spotted the player. Guards also have a separate reaction deck used in various situations, such as spotting a knocked-out guard or investigating a noise.
Boss encounters pose their own unique challenges, forcing you out of your comfort cardboard box and requiring you to think on your feet. Each boss fight feels distinct, from Revolver Ocelot darting around while bouncing bullets off walls to the Hind D having multiple target areas to damage. Thanks to the game’s tile-based nature, each boss fight takes place on a unique, large board with special elements affecting the encounter. For example, in Ocelot’s arena, the injured Kenneth Baker can be hit and killed, adding a new way to trigger a game over. These special tweaks only enhance the excitement and tension of the encounters, as they are rarely designed to favor the players.
This element of randomness kept me on my toes, never knowing exactly how far guards would move or which way they’d turn. The added dice rolls for checking if my actions made noise or if enemy shots would hit me resulted in an experience that balanced strategy with luck. There were multiple moments where I held my breath as I pulled a guard movement card, waiting to see if I’d be spotted. I never felt the game was unfair, but I also never expected it to be kind. Metal Gear does a superb job balancing strategy and luck.
While the box suggests the game can be played with up tofour players, at least for the campaign mode, I wouldn’t recommend going beyond two players. Personally, I found playing it as asolo board gameoffered the best experience. Each scenario specifies which of the four playable characters can be used, with the first two scenarios playable only by Snake. Only five scenarios in the entire campaign allow for four players (with no missions designed forthree players), and the first four-player mission doesn’t appear until the ninth scenario.
From a narrative standpoint, this makes sense. It wouldn’t be logical for Snake to infiltrate Shadow Moses with Gray Fox at his side or for Otacon to tackle Vulcan Raven alone. But from a board game perspective, this limitation significantly impacts the experience, making it hard to convince my MGS-loving friends to play when only one of them could participate in most of the game, while the others had to wait for the last few missions. I would have loved to see optional modifiers allowing additional characters intwo-playerscenarios or “What if?” scenarios offering alternate viewpoints and player counts.
To the game’s credit, the developers addressed this issue by allowing up to four players in the “VR Missions” mode. This additional mode, which includes its own set of special unlockable equipment cards,
has its own caveat: a lack of content. The included VR Missions book features six mission types – Recon, Escape, and Sabotage, among others – but each type has only one associated map layout. While some tokens and traps may change between sessions, and you can swap in a boss model for extra challenge, the guard layouts and objectives remain the same. With the map never changing, once you know what to do, the mode quickly loses its luster. I hope that CMON or the community releases creative and fun new maps and missions to keep things fresh.
You can also check out our recent reviews of board games based onDead Cells,S.T.A.L.K.E.R., andElden Ring.
Metal Gear Solid: The Board Game successfully distills much of the tactical espionage action from the video game into an engaging and challenging board game adaptation. The gameplay and miniatures are the stars of the show, striking a great balance between creativity and strategy. However, restrictions on character selection and player count for most of the campaign make it difficult to play with a full group of friends. When paired with the limited stage options in VR Missions, what could have been a sturdy and impressive cardboard box ends up feeling like one that’s been tossed onto too many FedEx trucks on its way to delivery—functional but slightly battered.
If you’re a fan of solo play or want to experience the game with one other person, you’ll find plenty to love. But if you’re looking for a game to play with a group of three or more, you may want to think twice before diving in."
"Sony is working on a new Starship Troopers movie reboot, according to various Hollywood sources.

The Hollywood Reportersaid District 9, Elysium, and Chappie director Neill Blomkamp has signed on to write and direct a new adaptation of Starship Troopers, the 1959 military sci-fi novel by Robert A. Heinlein.DeadlineandVarietybacked up the report.
This new Starship Troopers movie is not a continuation of or related to Paul Verhoeven’s cult classic 1997 sci-fi satireStarship Troopers. Rather it is a new adaptation of Heinlein’s novel, and comes from Sony’s Columbia Pictures.
News of Blomkamp’s involvement with this new Starship Troopers movie feels puzzling givenSony itself recently announced a live-action movie of blockbuster PlayStation Studios shooter Helldivers. Arrowhead's Helldivers is heavily inspired by Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers, and sees cannon fodder soldiers tasked with defending a satirized fascist Super Earth regime from alien bugs, among other enemy factions, while preaching Liberty and Managed Democracy to the masses.
Sony now faces the prospect of having new Starship Troopers and Helldivers movies going up against each other, although The Hollywood Reporter said Blomkamp’s take is not a remake of the Verhoeven movie, rather a return to the source material. Heinlein’s book that Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers is based on differs strongly in tone from the film, with many believing it promotes the ideals the film satirizes.
Neither this new Starship Troopers nor the Helldivers movie has a release window, so it may be some time before we see or hear from either project. Blomkamp’s last film was Sony’s own Gran Turismo, an adaptation of the long-running PlayStation-exclusive driving simulation series.

What makes this bundle stand out is that Astro Bot is included at no extra cost—effectively a free $70 game packed in with your console. If you needed an extra incentive to grab a PS5, this is it. Astro Bot isn’t just a throw-in; it was one of the best games of 2024, taking homeBest Game at The Game Awardsand cementing itself as a must-play for platforming fans.
If you want to be able to play games on disc, this is the one to get.
If you're cool with embracing the all-digital future, get this one. (You can buy a disc drive later if you change your mind).
Reviewing for IGN, Simon Cardy gave Astro Bot a 9, praising it as one of the most joyful experiences in gaming: ""Astro Bot made me smile from beginning to end. A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive. And while you don’t need a long history with Sony systems to enjoy it, it is especially a delight for those with a piece of PlayStation in their heart as a treasure trove full of playable nostalgia awaits.""
""Taking the PS5 marketing mantra that 'play has no limits' more seriously than you’d expect, Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it.""

"The globe-trotting World of Assassination trilogy of IO Interactive's Hitman series is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 asHitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition. And alongside arriving in the Switch 2 launch window, Agent 47 will also be donning some new, appropriately Nintendo-themed duds.

OnIO Interactive's site, the developer confirmed Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition will go up for pre-order soon, for both digital and physical editions. A pre-order of the digital edition will get you the Signature Pack, which includes two red-and-white outfits for Agent 47, a golden wrench, and a mushroom. Mushroom effects unknown at this time.
Physical pre-orders, meanwhile, offer both the Signature Pack and the Quack Pack, which offers a Luigi-themed green-and-grey suit and a green rubber duck. Much like a bald guy in a red tie and suit at a Paris fashion show, nothing unusual to see here.
Less-than-subtle references aside, it's fun to see Agent 47 get some Nintendo attire. Other games likeBayonettaandThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrimgot their own Nintendo crossover cosmetics, and Agent 47 certainly has earned a bit of Nintendo theming of his own.
The World of Assassination spans a trilogy of games, as Agent 47 undertakes a number of missions to assassinate targets and complete contracts for his clientele. Starting with 2016's Hitman, the WoA trilogy runs up through Hitman III, whichIGN gave a 9, saying: ""Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is one of the barcoded butcher's best appearances.""
Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition combines all of it together into one package. This includes the main campaign, contracts mode, escalations, Elusive Target arcades, and featured live content for Hitman, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3. Also included is the Freelancer game mode, a roguelike option for those who want even more variety and options in their Hitman experience.

"Here are the best deals for Wednesday, March 12. Highlights include a rare discount on a (used) PlayStation Portal accessory, Lenovo-exclusive price drops on PS5 DualSense metallic controllers, the first discount we've seen on the iPad Air with M3 chip, USB Type-C cables for only $2.99 apiece, Destiny-themed SteelSeries gaming headsets, and more.

Used: Like New Condition
Looks and functions as if it were new. Moderate packing damage observed during inspection.
ThePlayStation Portalhas never been discounted, but at least you can save on a used one.Amazon Resale(a rebranded Amazon Warehouse) currently has Used: Like New condition PS Portals in stock for only $158.70 shipped. It retails for $199 new, so that's a substantial 20% in savings. A Sony warranty may or may not be included, but Amazon Resale items benefit from the same 30-day return policy you get for buying a new item. We expect this item to sell out pretty quickly.
Lenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.
Amazon is offering a 6-foot INIU USB Type-A to USB Type-C cable for only $2.99 when you apply promo code ""C2ALZ6LN"" during checkout. You can add as many cables as you like and the discount should be applied to each and every cable. These cables are sheathed in nylon braiding for durability and can be used for both data sync and charging (Quick Charge 3.1A compatible). This is a great opportunity to stock up.
If you're thinking of jumping on the AMD bandwagon for your next upgrade, now is certainly the right time to do so. Alongside theRyzen 7 9800X3Dwhich debuted earlier this year, AMD has just released its two higher-end Ryzen 9 siblings in the Zen 5 ""X3D"" stack: the9950X3Dis available for $699 and the9900X3Dis available for $599. Collectively, these processors represent the best gaming chips across both Intel and AMD. Pure gamers should go with the 9800X3D and allocate their funds elsewhere; creators with deeper pockets and a penchant for gaming will benefit from the immense performance uplift on the new Ryzen 9 processors thanks to their increased core count and cache.
Thenew iPad Airsits in the middle of Apple’s tablet lineup, with better specs than the baseline iPad, but it’s not as powerful as the iPad Pro. That said, if you need more computing power in a tablet than what the baseline device above offers, the new iPad Air with M3 chip will likely suit you just fine.
As you can tell by the name, it has Apple’s powerful M3 chip, and it supports Apple Intelligence, unlike the baseline model. It’s also compatible with a new Magic Keyboard (see it at Apple) that has a row of function keys and a trackpad.
As part of its Spring Sale, SteelSeries is taking 40% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets. The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Desinty 2 in-game items.
As part of a generalHP Days Sale Event, you can score an excellent deal on a 4K-capable gaming PC. Right now, theHP Omen 25L GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super Gaming PChas dropped to $1,399.99 shipped after you apply $50 off coupon code ""HPDAYSPC50"". This is quite easily the lowest price we've seen for a prebuilt RTX 4070 Ti Super gaming desktop.
Amazon is offering a four-pack ofApple AirTagskeyfinders for only $64.49. That's over $35 off the retail price and only $16.10 for each AirTag. This is a very practical accessory for anyone who owns an iPhone and tends to lose small wearables like wallets, keys, or remotes.
4TB for $259.99
Samsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.
Apple's best earbuds are on sale today. Amazon is offering the second generationApple AirPods Prowireless noise-canceling earbuds for only $169.99 shipped, a savings of 32% and the best AirPods deal so far this year. That's about $20 more than theApple AirPods 4 with ANC, down from its usual $70 price premium. Between the two, the AirPods Pro is stillthe superior earbudsbecause it offers better sound quality and noise cancelation.
You can grab this 10,000mAh power bank for only $8.99 after you clip the 10% off and 40% off clippable coupons on the product page. We very rarely see 10,000mAh power banks listed for under $10 so grab this one while you can. This will charge a Nintendo Switch from 0% to 100% about 1.9 times.
For a limited time, Hulu is offering four months of Disney+ and Hulu Basic (Ad-Supported) Bundle for just $2.99 per month. The normal cost of this subscription is $10.99 per month. This deal only comes around a handful of times per year and worth it for just the Disney+ subscription alone.

"Here's your chance to get a massive, top notch OLED TV at one of the lowest prices we've seen, especially for a recent Samsung model. Right now, both Best Buy offering the83"" Samsung S85D 4K OLED Smart TVfor just $1,799.99 with free delivery. This is such a big discount that even the next size down (77"") at this price would have been a good purchase. This is anexcellent TV to pair up with your PlayStation 5or Xbox Series X since it has HDMI 2.1 inputs and supports 4K gaming at up to 120Hz.

The Samsung S85D is the most affordable TV in Samsung's 2024 OLED lineup. Unlike the higher-end S90D which uses a quantum dot OLED panel (and costs $500 more), the S85D uses a standard W-OLED panel. In terms of image quality, it's directly comparable to the LG B4 OLED TV (which costs $200 more). Since this is a true OLED panel, the S85D boasts near instantaneous response time, near infinite contrast ratio, and true blacks. It's superior to any other panel type for most use cases. For those of you who are concerned with burn-in, it's rarely an issue with OLED TVs; it's more of a concern with computer monitors where static screens (like your desktop) are more common.
The Samsung S85D also has the necessary features you'd want in a current-gengaming TV, like HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 120Hz panel forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. The S85D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to thePlaystation 5 Proconsole, since it has the power to run most games in true 4K resolution (vs upscaled 1440p in ""Performance"" mode) at 120Hz.
Right now this is the lowest price we can find for a brand new and fully warrantied 65"" OLED TV, especially if you want to stick with a tried and true brand like Samsung. If you're wondering how this TV stacks up to the new 2025 OLED TVs, it looks like most of the improvements are incremental: highlights include a slightly faster processor or better anti-glare coating. The panel technology is largely identical to 2024 models.

"A Black Friday deal on one of the best OLED TVs is back. Starting today,AmazonandSamsungare offering the 2024 65"" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV for only $1,399.99 shipped after $1,300 in instant savings. This is anexcellent TV to pair up with your PlayStation 5or Xbox Series X. This TV is considered to as good as or better than the popular LG C4 OLED TV. According toRTINGS, the Samsung S90D is a brighter TV with a wider color gamut, better color volume, wider viewing angle, and better HDR gradient handling.

The Samsung S90D is the current generation 2024 model. A new ""S90F"" model was announced during CES 2025, but it has yet to be released. This TV is equipped with Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times.
OLED technology aside, the Samsung S90D also has all the features you'd want in agaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming console. The S90D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to the recently releasedPlaystation 5 Proconsole since it can drive more games in quality mode (native 4K @ 120fps) than the standard PS5, which often needs to be set to performance mode (upscaled 4K).
If you're looking for a smaller size, the 42"", 48"", and 55"" models are also on sale. The 42"" model is ideal for PC monitor use. At that screen size, the 4K resolution equates to a respectable 104ppi pixel density and supports chroma 4:4:4 subsampling for clear, legible text. The HDMI 2.1 input supports refresh rates of up to 144Hz over 4K resolution.
For this week only, Best Buy is offering the 77"" Samsung S84D 4K OLED smart TV for $1,499.99. That's only $150 more than the 65"" S90D model for a 40% larger screen size. The S84D is Best Buy's exclusive model that's identical to the S85D but with slightly better speakers (30W vs 20W). Compared to the S90D, the S84D is a step down in image quality since it doesn't utilize quantum dot technology and the refresh rate is limited to 120Hz instead of 144Hz. However, it's still an outstanding TV compared to other TVs on the market and an excellent value at this price.

"With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its wayandits audience.

Capcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.
But in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.
2016 was a bad year for Capcom.
The big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.
This was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.
All of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .
Achieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.
Capcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4.
2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema.
Unfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.
“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.
This directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op.
This downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.
But it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.
This slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.
It was clear something needed to change.
By the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability.
While neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.
“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”
Those constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6.
""We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V,"" Nakayama says. ""And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title.""
All this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards.“There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.
“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”
The team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.
There was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master.
“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.”
Street Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series.
While they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.
While Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.
Around the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience.
“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”
If you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.
“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”
Itsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance.
No other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened.
Firstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.
“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”
Monster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.
This created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.
But the reality was that Monster Hunterdidhave fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.
Released in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.
“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”
It was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”
It wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world.
“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”Tsujimoto says.
One important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.
This explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.
“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”
Monster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call.
“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&D teams were divided into R&D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”
Takeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.
There were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.
“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.
The game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series.
But Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time.
“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.
The result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history.
Naturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?
Ampo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”
But despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.
Around the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.
“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.”
Itsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.
The 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. ""Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively,"" Itsuno says. ""When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”
This vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should.
Ampo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, ""So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.”
This meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.
“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”
Since 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.
Focusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat.
But what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.
Many of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever.
When asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”
Monster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”

In retro news, I'm celebrating the 21st birthday of a series black sheep that still sold many a GameCube,Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. As a remake of the '98 PS classic, this was a pretty surreal (and, in parts, misguided) love letter. It was as if Snake had emerged from a time machine, equipped with the control scheme and acrobatics ofMGS 2: Sons of Liberty. Helmed by Silicon Knights and injected with the ""cinematic flair"" of Hollywood action director Ryuhei Kitamura, the end result divided fans quicker than a cyber-ninja disarming Ocelot.
Upgrades like first-person aiming and being able to hang/drop from ledges were a double-edged sword. While they made Snake more powerful and adaptable, they also turned sections of his Shadow Moses op into a cakewalk. The level design, originally built for the PS1’s limitations, just wasn’t fully rebalanced to accommodate these new mechanics, and some re-recorded voice performances weren't ideal. Be that as it Mei [Ling], I still recall loving this at launch and adore the copy I own.

In retro news, I'm (somehow) celebrating the 23rd birthday of the OG Xbox, a console that blew my mind at launch (even though I was happily married to a PS2). This was the chunky vehicle that brought Microsoft into the console gaming world. And while it didn't have the prettiest design or the greatest library of games, it gave us two important contributions to gaming:Haloand Xbox Live.
While some N64 enthusiasts may argue thatGoldenEyepaved the way for quality console first-person shooters, it wasHalothat revolutionised the genre. Almost every FPS that came after Halo utilised its control scheme and a modified version of its health system. But where Halo truly succeeded was in providing console gamers with the first-of-its-kind 16-player LAN battles. This was the first shooter that made my PC gaming mates jealous, and I still own and adore myLimited Edition Crystal Xbox.

"As part of its Spring Sale, SteelSeries is taking 35% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets. The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Destiny 2 in-game items.

The SteelSeries Nova 7 is the latest successor to the highly rated Arctis 7 series of headsets. It's every bit as good as its predecessor but with some welcome upgrades like a USB Type-C charging port, a longer battery life (38 hours vs. 30 hours), simultaneous wireless and Bluetooth connectivity, and multi-platform compatibility. PC gamers also have access to the SteelSeries GG app, which opens up a whole suite of customization for your audio. If that's too much for you, there are presets for specific games that are actually tailormade by the game developers. For PS5 gamers, the Nova 7 is also compatible with the PlayStation 5's Tempest 3D Audio.
The Arctis Nova 7 is one of thebest headsetsyou can get forPS5and PC. In hisNova 7 review, Matthew Adler wrote that ""SteelSeries continues to push the boundaries of what a headset is capable of. With the addition of simultaneous Bluetooth audio, you can enjoy music, podcasts, or just chat with your friends without losing your game audio – all with a single pair of headphones. The Arctis Nova 7’s new design is sleek, lightweight, and still remains one of the most comfortable headsets I’ve ever used."" I own a pair of these myself and highly recommend it.

"Final Fantasy VII Rebirthis now available at its lowest price so far.Woot is offering the game for $32.99for PS5, a significant drop from its regular price of $69.99. For those who have been waiting to pick it up, this is a great opportunity to do so at a significant discount, and potentially one of the best deals of the year.

It's hard to imagine the game dropping any further in price anytime soon, making this likely the best opportunity to buy it at the lowest price possible in 2025. With such a steep discount, I wouldn't be surprising if it sells out quickly, so if you're interested in picking it up, don't wait too long.
In our 9/10 review, Michael Higham called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth“a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth,” and “an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long.” While it takes some creative liberties in reimagining the classic, he described it as “thrilling and unexpectedly impactful.”

Update:This TV is also available onAmazonfor a little more.
The Samsung S90C is a slightly older 2023 model (superseded by theS90Dfor 2024), but it's still considered to be one of the best OLED TVs available. That's because the S90C uses Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. It's generally considered better than LG's ""Evo"" technology found on the C-series TVs, which attempt to do the same thing. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. At the moment, there's no better panel technology that's readily available at a reasonable price.
OLED technology aside, the Samsung S90C also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz (rare in a 2023 TV) as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. The S90C also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode.

"Samsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.

4TB for $259.99
The Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.
The Samsung 990 Evo Plus does not have a preinstalled heatsink. However, the 990 Evo Plus SSD is a newer single-sided SSD design that is power efficient and doesn't generate as much heat as SSDs from before. That means you probably don't need to use a heatsink and it should still work perfectly fine in a PS5 console without any thermal throttling. That said, you certainly could for peace of mind and I wouldn't see any disadvantage to that aside fromspending an extra $7.

"Today’s bargain roundup is filled with blockbuster hits, cult classics, and a few surprises that you didn’t even know you needed. My picks of the litter include an over half offSonic SuperstarsandThe Last of Us Part I. I’m also always about a heavily reducedWitcher 3 Complete EditionandCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate. Just a ludicrous amount of RPGing hours for way less of your monies.

In retro news, I'm celebrating the 16th birthday ofArmy of Two. It's a now extinct co-op shooter that made scary face masks + warfighters cool beforeModern Warfare 2's 'Ghost' was even a twinkle in Infinity Ward's eye. AoT managed to belt out a three game run and almost a Michael Mann written and directed movie, then it all went FUBAR. Would play a remaster of these, EA.

"Dinosaur survival gameArk 2, which some had suspected might have run into trouble or even been abandoned, is back on after developer Studio Wildcard revealed a new expansion forArk: Survival Ascendedthat leads into the sequel.

Ark: Lost Colony is the first original expansion pack for Ark 1 remake Ark: Survival Ascended, and its reveal trailer, below, was produced by anime studio Mappa (Jujutsu Kaisen, Attack on Titan, Chainsaw Man) and stars voiceover by the Michelle Yeoh, who reprises her role as Mei Yin from Ark: The Animated Series.
Studio Wildcard said the expansion will feature numerous cinema-grade anime story sequences created by Mappa. Here’s the official blurb:
In its note to press, Studio Wildcard said Ark: Lost Colony “directly connects” the storylines of Ark’s Extinction and Genesis expansions and leads into the events of Ark 2.
Ark 2 is the Unreal Engine 5-powered sequel to the hugely successfulArk Survival Evolved. It was first announced with a surprise Vin Diesel cameo at The Game Awards 2020, at the time with a 2022 release date, but it was later delayed into 2023. Then, earlier in 2023,Ark 2 was delayed again, this time to late 2024 as an Xbox Series X and S console exclusive, day-one on Game Pass, and on PC via Steam and Windows.
As recently as December 2023,Studio Wildcard was still insisting Ark 2 was on track for a late 2024 release window. Obviously that didn’t happen, sparking concern from fans. So this announcement, coming three months into 2025, will help reassure fans that Ark 2 is still in the works, although Studio Wildcard failed to provide an updated release window.
We do have firmer details for Ark: Lost Colony, however. Pre-orders kick off in June 2025, and all purchases immediately unlock exclusive Ark: Lost Colony preview gameplay content. A full release is set for November 2025, with Ark: Lost Colony priced at $29.99 for Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, and PC.

"Amazon is offering a great discount on one of the best budget headphones you can find. For just $49, theJLab JBuds Lux Over-Ear Headphonesoffers features you'd find in headphones that can cost 5x-10x as much, like wireless connectivity with Bluetooth Multipoint, active noise cancellation, spatial audio technology, and more. Most importantly, sound quality is better than any other headphone in its price range.

SoundGuys recently reviewed the JLab JBuds Luxand gave these headphones an absolutely glowing review, mentioning that they were one of the best headphones under $100. SoundGuys considered them an extremely good valueat their retail price of $79. At the current price of $49.99, it's hard to find a better bang for your buck, and it's especially nice that all four color options have been discounted.
The JLab JBuds Lux's laundry list of premium features include large 40mm drivers, Dolby Atmos compatible Spatial Audio, support for PlayStation Tempest 3D AudioTech and Windows Sonic, hybrid active noise cancellation, a ""Be Aware"" mode that lets you listen in on your environment, built-in microphone for hands-free calling, up to 70 hours of battery life on a single charge (40 hours with ANC enabled), USB Type-C charging, and Bluetooth Multipoint.
These headphones even look the part. The JLab JBuds Lux are thoughtfully designed for both comfort and performance, with cushy earcups that conform to your ear while also providing an effective seal for passive isolation, a padded headband for prolonged comfort, and a foldable design that makes them easy to tote around.
For more options, check out our list ofthe best noise canceling headphones of 2025. Be forewarned that they are far more expensive than the JLab Lux. Our top pick - the Sony WH-1000XM5 - for example,sells for over $300 on Amazon.

"Amazon quietly restocked a bunch ofPokémon TCG bundles just days agoand stock is already running low. These Scarlet & Violet sets have been MIA for weeks, and now they’re back at retail prices. I already added a couple to my cart,Surging SparksBooster Bundle,Shrouded FableETB and Paldean Fates Booster Bundle. Trainers need to snap these up quick. If they’re gone by the time you get there, that’s on you.

Looking for the least expensive PlayStation 5 console you can your hands on? As part of its US Anniversary Sale, AliExpress is offering an importedSony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Editiongaming console for $367.94 shipped after $80 off coupon code ""MAYUE008"". This is a brand new and retail boxed product that is stocked in a US warehouse and qualifies for local delivery, which means it ships free and arrives within about 1-2 weeks.
I also spotted a couple of power banks on sale from INIU and Anker. If you’ve ever watched your phone die mid-flight or mid-text, you know why I’m excited. These things are cheap, fast, and less annoying than asking strangers for a charger at an airport. Do with that information what you will. Oh, and while we’re on the topic of things I absolutely don’t need but definitely want: theGamera: Attack of Legionaction figure is up for preorder at the IGN Store for a cool $560, and Humble Bundle just dropped a massiveDragonlance book bundlethat practically dares you to add 25+ fantasy novels to your backlog for the price of lunch.
I want this bundle purely for the thrill of cracking six packs in a row and pretending I’m building a deck for Worlds. The Surging Sparks expansion is still new enough to feel fresh, and at $45.02, it’s a decent value compared to scalper prices that make you question your financial decisions. If you just want to dip into the latest set without going full collector mode, this is it.
Shiny Pokémon are back, and apparently so is my addiction to them. The Paldean Fates bundle gives you six chances to pull something sparkly, and while $69.94 isn’t exactly pocket change, I think the potential dopamine hit is worth the gamble. It’s in stock, it ships fast, and I’ve made worse choices at 2 a.m. on eBay.
I’m not saying this is the nerdiest thing you can buy today, but it’s definitely on the leaderboard. Humble Bundle just dropped a massive Dragonlance collection; 25+ books for about the cost of lunch. If you’ve ever wanted to get lost in magical twin drama, cursed artifacts, or the politics of dwarves (because who hasn’t), this is your sign. Plus, part of your purchase supports Room to Read, so now your TBR pile can come with good karma.
In my opinion, this is the one to grab if you're all-in on the set. Nine booster packs, a Pecharunt promo, themed sleeves, dice, and an actually-useful storage box? For $54.96? I’ve spent more on less at Taco Bell. Plus, it's still Prime eligible, which means you don’t have to sell your soul for free shipping. Win-win.
This is what happens when you give kaiju collectors exactly what they want: a 9.5-inch figure of LEGION fromGamera 2, complete with flying parts, glowing bits, and articulation that would make Spider-Man jealous. Sure, it’s $560, but I’ve seen statues half as cool go for double that. If you’re the kind of person who rearranges shelf space for something before buying it, I totally get it.
This thing charges your phone like it’s got something to prove. At $26.98, it gives you a full week’s worth of backup power and a built-in flashlight just in case you drop your phone and your dignity under your car seat. I want it purely because it has an LED readout that makes me feel like I’m operating a mission control panel instead of just charging my AirPods.
I think this is the best deal of the day, and not just because it’s $17.99. It’s slim, light, and can survive a drop better than my will to stay off social media. Anker knows what it’s doing, and this charger just works. No random overheating, no mystery ports, just plug it in and keep scrolling through whatever app is currently ruining your sleep schedule.
Hulu + Live TVoffers a three-day free trialthat allows you to take the live TV streaming service for a spin. This is one of the overallbest streaming free trialsbecause it gets you a bundle of services. It is quite a bit shorter than the standard Hulu free trial of 30 days, but it's a great way to test it out over the weekend.
With a 240Hz refresh rate, Dual QHD resolution, and 0.03ms response time, this 49-inch ultrawide OLED is built for high-performance PC gaming. The 1800R curve and HDR True Black 400 make it incredibly immersive, while FreeSync Premium Pro helps keep gameplay smooth and responsive.
This Android tablet comes with an S Pen included, a 10.4-inch display, and Samsung DeX for multitasking. At under $200, it’s a solid pick for casual gamers, students, or anyone who wants a lightweight, entertainment-ready tablet with productivity perks.
Celebrate Women's History Month with a killer bundle featuring female-led games. Titles include Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, Control: Ultimate Edition,Darksiders III,Beyond: Two Souls, and more. It’s a $160+ value for just $12, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity.
With a whopping 10,000Pa of suction, self-refilling, self-emptying, sonic mopping, and even hot-air mop drying, the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra takes hands-off cleaning to the next level. It's packed with AI features and even supports pet tracking and video calls.
Amazon’s newest Kindleadds color to the mix with a 7"" Colorsoft display. It still lasts up to 8 weeks on a single charge and now supports wireless charging and full-color highlights. It's ideal for reading graphic novels, cookbooks, or anything where visuals matter.
Enjoy spatial audio, active noise canceling, and up to 40 hours of battery life. These over-ear headphones are compatible with both iOS and Android, and support lossless audio over USB-C. A strong option for commuters, creators, and music lovers.
This Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code ""IFPRZAZ"" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16"" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.
$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.
I think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.
If you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.
At $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.
$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.
This speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.
Crisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.
This speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.
Bass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.
XM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.
A wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.
My living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.
I didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.
This TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.
I want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.
This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.

"Having launched in 2019, Apple TV+ is one of the youngest streaming services available today. Over the years, the Apple-owned platform has grown into a powerhouse of original TV shows, likeTed LassoandSeverance, as well as movies likeKillers of the Flower Moon. While it may not release new content at the same pace as something like Netflix, Apple TV+ is only a fraction of the price and comes bundled with just about every new Apple device purchase, making it easier than ever to check out its growing library. Below, we'll break down what Apple TV+ is as a service, how much it costs, and how to sign up for a free trial.

Apple TV+ offers a 7-day free trial for all new subscribers. Simply head over to theApple TV+ homepageor app and you'll be greeted with a button that says ""Accept Free Trial."" NewiPhones,iPads, Apple TVs, and Mac computers also come bundled with a 3-month Apple TV+ trial, which requires manual activation through the Apple TV app on the device. In both cases, once your trial ends, your subscription will automatically renew at the standard monthly rate of $9.99/month.
Apple TV+ is an award-winning streaming service featuring Apple Originals — exclusive series, movies, documentaries, and more, with new content added every month. While it was a bit barebones when it launched in 2019, Apple TV+ has grown its library to over 180 series, with breakout hits like Ted Lasso, Severance, and Silo, as well as over 80 original films, including Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. Apple TV+ was also thefirst streaming service to receive an Academy Award for its original film CODA, which released in 2022.
While Apple TV+ may not boast a massive library like Netflix, it's long maintained a ""quality over quantity"" approach when it comes to its original programming with something that will surely appeal to just about anyone, regardless of age.
Apple TV+ is one of the least-expensive streaming services at $9.99/month.Since there's no ads by default, there's no ad-supported or limited tiers to worry about.
Aside from standalone subscriptions, Apple TV+ is included in a bundled service calledApple One. The lowest-tier Apple One plan gives you access to four subscriptions: Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and a 50GB iCloud+ plan, all for $19.95/month. The Premier Apple One plan costs $37.95/month, adding Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, and an upgrade to 2TB of iCloud+ storage.
If you're a current college or university student, you can sign up for aApple Music plan that includes Apple TV+at a discounted rate of $5.99/month. Apple Music usually costs $10.99/month on its own, so this is quite the deal.
Treated as a separate subscription, Apple TV also hosts Major League Soccer streams. TheMLS Season Passstarts at $14.99/month, and Apple TV+ subscribers get a $2 discount.
Apple TV+ is available to stream on all of your Apple devices including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV set-top boxes. Additionally, you can stream Apple TV+ on a variety of internet-connected smart TVs, Roku devices, Amazon Fire TV devices, Google TV devices, as well as PlayStation and Xbox consoles. You can also AirPlay from an Apple device to any compatible AirPlay device that doesn't feature the native Apple TV+ app.

"The weekend is officially here, and we've rounded up the best deals you can find! Discover the best deals for Saturday, March 29, below:

Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake takes the beloved NES game to brand-new heights using HD-2D.  For $40, this is an excellent deal and the lowest we've seen the game yet. I spent 70 hours obtaining the Platinum Trophy for this one on PlayStation 5, so you can expect a giant adventure ahead.
This weekend, you can save over $100 off the Logitech G915 TKL Lightspeed Keyboard. This wireless mechanical keyboard is perfect for any setup, with a wide variety of customization options available.

"I didn’t think we’d see a proper Pokémon TCG restock this early in 2025. Honestly, I was betting on summer at best, but here we are with actual product showing up on Amazon and not behind some sketchy paywalled Discord server. While the internet’s currently losing its mind over Prismatic Evolutions and burning money chasing stock alerts for Rival Destinies, the smart play is scooping up the older sets that just hit Amazon Global. We’re talking Scarlet and Violet era stuff, Sword and Shield throwbacks, and boxes that were basically extinct six months ago.

This is the kind of flood the TCG community needed. Not just for collectors trying to complete sets, but for anyone who’s tired of battling bots for ETBs like it’s the Hunger Games. There’s a real mix available right now: Booster Bundles, Premium Collections, tins with actual storage value. And yes, even a few deals that make it feel like Amazon’s trying to keep the vibe positive. If you’re chasing big pulls like Greninja SIR or Pikachu ex SIR, or just need to stock up on sleeves and dice, this is the best stock refreshes we’ve seen in a while.
AliExpress is currently offering theSony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphonesfor only $225.18 after coupon code:IFP7FJZis applied during checkout. This product is stocked in a US warehouse, so it ships free and arrives within about a week. This is an import model with a warranty that won't be honored in the United States. AliExpress makes up for it with a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days.
In our glowingSony WH1000XM5 review, Kevin Lee wrote that ""The Sony WH-1000XM5 is hands down the best sounding and most impressive noise-canceling headphones around. They demand a high premium but the cost of audio excellence is well worth it with this pair of headphones.""
The real deal here is the fact that theTwilight MasqueradeElite Trainer Box is actually in stock. Seeing it available without a 200% markup or sketchy third-party seller feels borderline miraculous. You’re getting nine booster packs, a full-art Teal Mask Ogerpon promo, and all the usual ETB goodies like energy cards, condition markers, and themed sleeves.
It’s not every day you seeBrilliant StarsBuild and Battle Boxes in stock, let alone without having to navigate the wild west of resale sites. At $63.34, this one comes with four booster packs and a pre-release promo card, which makes it a solid pickup for collectors looking to flesh out their Sword and Shield era sets. Arceus VSTAR headlines the expansion, and the pull potential here still holds up.
Among Us 4-Pack on Steam is a sneaky little deal that gives you four copies of the game for the price of one, making it dangerously easy to rope your friends into a night of trust issues and vent-related betrayal. It supports cross-platform play, customizable settings, and chaotic emergency meetings that usually end with the wrong person getting ejected. If you’ve somehow missed the social deduction chaos, now’s the perfect time to catch up and take three crewmates down with you.
TheHisuian Electrode V Boxis back in stock at Amazon for $42.45, which is a win considering how sporadically these pop up. It's one of those V boxes that slipped under the radar when it first launched, but now that Sword and Shield-era product is drying up it’s worth grabbing. You get a foil Hisuian Electrode V promo, a regular Electrode foil, an oversized version (because why not), and four booster packs to rip through.
This limited-edition snack box is a flavor-packed tribute toAssassin’s Creed Shadows, blending premium Japanese treats with collectible game merch in a way that feels like an edible side quest. You get 15 unique snacks, a full bag of exclusive Kit Kats, a custom Tenugui towel, and even an in-game item called The Hourglass that’s only available through this box. With artwork prints, a detailed snack guide, and a box sleeve that transforms into a display-worthy poster, it’s more than just snacks.
Seeing theShining FatesPikachu V Box on Amazon again feels like spotting a shiny in the wild. At $49.96 it’s not exactly a steal, but having it in stock is the real value. This box comes with a foil Pikachu V promo, an oversized version for flair, and four Shining Fates booster packs. That means a legit shot at pulls from one of the most hype-filled sets of the Sword and Shield era.
TheSurging SparksBooster Bundle is actually in stock at Amazon for $47.95, which is kind of a miracle considering how fast this set’s been disappearing. You get six booster packs from the newest Scarlet and Violet expansion, which includes some major chase cards like Pikachu ex SIR and Latias ex. If you missed the chaos of launch day or couldn’t snag a bundle without battling bots, this is your chance to catch up.
I want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.
This phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.
I can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.
RimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.
This SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.
I never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.
I think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.

If you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.
Still using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.
These aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.
These Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.
Luxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.
This isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.
For those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says ""powerful Pokémon"" like an angry robot penguin).
I'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.
If somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.
Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).
If you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, ""I really need to delete some games,"" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.
Samsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype.

"Netflix's President of Games, Alain Tascan, is expecting a future generation that relies less on gaming consoles as major players like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo push forward with new hardware.

The lead of the streaming giant’s video game division shared his thoughts on how gaming fans might soon play their favorite titles during an interview withThe Game Businessthat took place following a Netflix presentation in San Francisco. During the event itself, Tascan was asked if the streamer had any intention of taking a crack at console gaming, but he’s not so sure younger gamers are even interested in what something like a PlayStation 6 could bring to the table.
“[When it comes to] console, we started to look at the future where the platform is agnostic,” he explained. “Look at the younger generation. Are eight year-olds and 10 year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6? I am not sure. They are wanting to interact with any digital screen, whatever it is, wherever it is, even in the car. With console you’re thinking about high definition, you’re thinking about the controller […] If we look at this older model, I think it will restrain us.”
Tascan told The Game Business that he’s got a soft spot for console gaming despite his concerns, specifically calling out Nintendo’s Wii as a personal favorite. He’s spent many years at studios such as EA, Ubisoft, and Epic Games in the past, so the idea of more traditional console game releases is far from foreign for him. For Netflix, though, things are trending in a different direction.
While the company has a proven track record for creating game adaptations for its IPs with subscription add-ons like Stranger Things 3: The Game, Too Hot to Handle: Love Is a Game, and more, it’s also experimented with giving users access to notable, familiar games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition. Each game can be played straight from a mobile phone if a subscriber chooses, and as Tascan clarified during that recent event, Netflix will be doubling down on this strategy as it develops party games and establishes itself as a hub for kids and gamer families.
“I am very vigorous about lowering friction and eliminating it if we can,” he told The Game Business. “I see that the subscription is friction as well. Maybe good friction because it makes business sense, but still we did the test of eliminating subscription for [mobile game] Squid Game: Unleashed. And we may do other tests.”
He continued: “But the other friction is having enough controllers for family. Having a piece of hardware that might be expensive, that’s another friction. Waiting for a game to download, that’s another friction. I am [looking at] all the obstacles, and asking if we can reduce them as much as possible.”
Netflix said in early 2024 that games engagement had tripled throughout 2023, signaling that it would continue investing in the space in the future after a 2021CNBCreport suggestedless than 1% of subscribers were tapping into its gamesofferings. In October 2024, the streaming giant cut back on its gaming ambitions when itshut down its AAA studio headed by former Overwatch, Halo, and God of War developers. AGame Developerreport from last month said cuts had also recently hit Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, a teamNetflix picked up in 2021.
As Netflix seeks to tap into a market that it expects to be uninterested in game consoles, there’s little reason to doubt we’ll see something like aPlayStation 6ornext Xboxfrom Sony and Microsoft, respectively. Nintendo, meanwhile, is teetering on the edge of a brand-new console generation with itshighly anticipated Switch 2 device. It will pull back the curtain on its new tech with a focused Direct presentation next week, with many fans expecting to hear more aboutwhat features the Switch 2 brings to the table, its release date, andhow pre-orders are being handled.

"Palworldhas a big new update that adds crossplay across all platforms among many other new features.

Update v0.5.0 also lets players store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds. A new storage system has 10 times the capacity of the regular Palbox. Not only can guild members access it, but it can be used as a personal storage with private settings.
Elsewhere, you can now change your character’s appearance without affecting armor stats (transmog), there’s a photo mode, blueprint upgrading, and dedicated servers for Mac, among other changes detailed in the patch notes below.
Developer Pocketpair said it’s working on adding dedicated servers for the PlayStation 5 version and will release them at some point in the future.
Palworld has had an incredible32 million playerssince its early access launch in January 2024. The studio haslaid out a content roadmap for Palworld's 2025that looks fairly lengthy; alongside crossplay, there is an ""ending scenario"" and more new content on the way for the hugely popular creature-catching survival game.
Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC a year ago, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developercouldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success,signing a deal with Sonyto form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP, and launching the game on PS5.
Looming over all this isa lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, who seek ""an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages"" on the grounds that Palworld has allegedly infringed on ""multiple"" patent rights.Pocketpair has provided an update, identifying the patents the studio is allegedly infringing, and it has since tweaked how players summon Pals in Palworld, apparently in response. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in court, saying: “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”

"No video games for you!Superbadco-writerSeth Rogenhas revealed that Sony foundJonah Hill's character so ""reprehensible"" that reps insisted he stay away from aPlayStationduring a video game scene in the now-beloved comedy.

“On Superbad, we were told that Jonah Hill’s character, Seth, was so reprehensible to the studio that they were like, there’s a scene where they’re playing video games and [Sony] was like, ‘Jonah can’t touch a PlayStation,’ ” Rogen told Rotten Tomatoes in a South By Southwest 2025 red carpet video.
“They were like, ‘We can’t have him interact with our products, because it’s too vile a character.’ And I was like, ‘It’s based on me, that’s very insulting.’ But we accommodated them, ultimately.”
Sony Pictures co-financed the film, so they had a lot of leverage over a few top-notch comics trying to make a generational comedy. Ultimately, instead of Hill’s Seth keysmashing his controller and yelling at the TV screen when he died in-game, Michael Cera’s character Evan can be seen playingThe Getaway: Black Mondayon PS2 in that scene. But fun fact: there’s actually a bit of a gag with one of Cera’s lines here. He mentions using an M16 assault rifle in the game — but The Getaway: Black Monday, a British cop game, doesn’t even include them in the weapons arsenal. Go figure.
Rogen was at SXSW to promote his new Apple TV+ seriesThe Studio, which had its world premiere at the festival just days ago.
Superbad also starred Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Emma Stone, alongside memorable cameos from Bill Hader and Rogen himself. Rogen co-wrote the script with Evan Goldberg and Greg Mottola directed.

Marcando o retorno da franquia de jogos de luta DRAGON BALL BUDOKAI TENKAICHI, DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO leva a série a uma nova era, ampliando os limites da jogabilidade e dos recursos de um brawler de arena.
Modo de Jogo: Batalha de Episódios é um modo para um jogador em que é possível escolher entre 8 personagens, como Goku ou Vegeta, e reviver algumas das principais batalhas desde DRAGON BALL Z até o Torneio de Poder de DRAGON BALL SUPER.

And, of course, the update improves system software performance and stability. Check out the patch notes below:
Meanwhile, the PS4 has a system software update, but there’s much less to this one.Update 12.50comes with a single note:

"Samsung came in strong with today’s deals, and I have to admit, I’m eyeing a couple of them up.The 49-inch Odyssey G9 gaming monitorlooks like something pulled straight from a sci-fi movie.The Galaxy Tab S10+ 5Gis basically a laptop in disguise, and theGalaxy Z Flip 6is making flip phones cool again. If that’s not enough, theS24 Ultrais here to remind every other smartphone who’s boss, and theSSD dealsare giving me a solid excuse to finally clean up my storage situation.

Some of these discounts are impressive, like$500 off that insane QD-OLED monitor. Others, like theSonic statueandRimWorld deal, are more like little bonus treats for the fans. Either way, if you’ve been waiting for a solid sale on a gaming monitor, a high-end phone, or a storage upgrade, Samsung has something worth looking at today.
AliExpress has brand new PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch OLED consoles on sale for prices you won't find anywhere else. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming console that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by youraccount, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item.
I want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.
This phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.
I didn’t know I needed an 11-inch Sonic statue until now. The detail is impressive, the LED lights make it pop, and it’s half off. If you’re a Sonic fan, this is an easy yes. If you’re not, well, now’s a great time to start.
I can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.
RimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.
This SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.
I never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.
I think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.

A genuine Apple leather case for $11.99? That’s not a typo. It’s an 80% discount. Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.
If you’re tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.
Why buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.
If you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.
Still using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.
These aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.
These Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.
Luxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.
This isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.
For those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says ""powerful Pokémon"" like an angry robot penguin).
I'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.
If somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.
Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).
If you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, ""I really need to delete some games,"" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.
Samsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room. The Acoustic Lens Subwoofer ensures deep, punchy bass, while Adaptive Sound and Game Mode Pro make sure everything from dialogue to explosions sounds crisp. At $764 off, this is the cheapest we’ve seen it outside of Black Friday.
LG B4 OLED TVbrings incredible picture quality at a price that doesn’t require selling a kidney. It features Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, an α8 AI Processor that automatically enhances whatever you’re watching, and LG’s latest webOS for easy access to streaming apps and over 300 free LG Channels. Gamers get Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and VRR, plus four HDMI 2.1 ports. At $499.99, this is one of the best deals for an OLED right now.
Samsung’s S90D OLED TVis a beast, packing AI-powered 4K upscaling, Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for silky smooth gameplay, and Dolby Atmos for immersive sound. Real Depth Enhancer makes everything look more lifelike, and PANTONE validation ensures accurate color reproduction. At $300 off, this is a great price for a high-end 65” OLED TV.
Sony’s WH-CH520 headphonesoffer 50 hours of battery life, customizable sound settings, and a lightweight, comfortable design. Multipoint connection makes switching between devices seamless, and DSEE upscaling improves compressed audio. At just $35.95, these are one of the best budget wireless headphones out there today.
Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 bring top-tier noise cancellation, a Tensor A1 chip for AI-powered audio enhancements, and large 11mm drivers for rich bass. Conversation Detection automatically switches to transparency mode when you talk, so you don’t have to take them out. If you need premium wireless earbuds, this is asolid deal for these 9/10 buds.
Enshrouded is a survival RPG with deep crafting, intense combat, and massive co-op potential. Play solo or team up with up to 16 friends, build custom bases, and fight through a dark, mysterious world. It’s still in early access, but at $23.99, it’s worth jumping in now aswe gave it 8/10.

"I think today might be the day my wallet throws in the towel. Woot is coming in hot with one of thebest PS5 game dealsI’ve seen all year, and Sony’s decided we’ve all earned a full-blown audio upgrade. Between the markdowns onnoise-canceling headphones,portable speakers, andhome theater gear, it's giving ""treat yourself"" energy with ""I won’t regret this at all"" delusion.

I want at least three of these, but I’m pretending to be financially responsible and only putting two in my cart. If you’ve been eyeballing anything fromhigh-end headphonestosmart display cases for your action figures (I meancollectibles), now’s probably the best time to stop window shopping and start adding to your cart.
This Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code ""IFPRZAZ"" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16"" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.
$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.
I think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.
If you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.
At $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.
$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.
This speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.
Crisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.
This speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.
Bass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.
XM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.
A wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.
My living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.
I didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.
This TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.
I want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.
This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.
If you're searching for your next new game to play,Humble Choice Marchis now live, and this is the perfect bundle to discover something new! This month, Homeworld 3 headlines the bundle, with other PC games like Wild Hearts, Pacific Drive, Zau, and Gravity Circuit also included. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars to grab these games individually, you can get all eight games for just $11.99 at Humble Bundle for this month only.

"This is a guest column fromNintendo Life, the world’s most-visited independent Nintendo website. It covers the world of Nintendo from all angles: the games, hardware, and history with in-depth reviews and features, and also the fan community, culture, and conversation that’s formed around gaming’s most beloved company and characters.

For Nintendo fans the world over, time seems to be passing slower than ever. Sincethe January revealof Switch 2 (the official Nintendo one, notthe leaksweeks before) we've all been crossing days off the calendar counting down tothe April Nintendo Direct, when we'll finally get a proper deep dive at the hardware, a look at new games, and perhaps even a release date. Well, hopefully.
Ravenous as we are for solid Switch 2 details — ones that don't come from coverage-hungry case manufacturers or a 17-second peek of a newMario Kart— there's one I’m confident of: from day one, Switch 2 will be the ultimate Nintendo console.
I can already sense some '?' Blocks popping off but hear me out – even at this early stage it's hard to argue that Switch 2 won't be the ultimate portal for Nintendo games past, present, and future.
It's largely thanks to Nintendo Switch Online and the huge, historic catalogue steadily assembled sinceSeptember 2018. You get access to 182 games with a regular sub, or a whopping 290 with the 'Expansion Pack'. It’s not just Nintendo games either, the 47-strong selection ofSEGA Mega Drive/Genesis gamescovers some of that system's absolute best too. Plus the rubbishVirtua Fighter 2port.
Hey, they can't all be winners, but from classics to cult curios (seriously, check out the late-cycleSutte Hakkunfor Super Famicom if you haven't already), NSO is a vast buffet of historical video game nuggets served on a single handy device, a perfect introduction for younger gamers unfamiliar with the olden days. Grizzled vets can baulk at the idea of whippersnappers not having playedYoshi's IslandorOcarina of TimeorGoldenEye>Bunker>Power Weapons - no Oddjob, but time marches on and it's only natural. NSO's boon is offering so many iconic, formative games on a platter. We can debate the quality of the emulation (and we have), butthe library is impressive, despite gaps, and it's still growing.
That's all before we get to backwards compatibility with the current console; its lineup of series-bests should almost all be playable on the new Switch. Calls of recency bias will ring out for a generation or two yet, but the towering quality ofBreath of the Wildand its direct sequel Tears of the Kingdom,Super Mario OdysseyandSuper Mario Bros. Wonder,Animal Crossing: New Horizons,Splatoon 3,Pikmin 4, theMetroids, theXenoblades,and more is undeniable. If they're not the pinnacle of their respective series, they're in the conversation, and they'll all almost definitely be playable on Switch 2.
But what about third parties? What about indies?The specifics are hazy at this stage, but we're assuming that everything's coming over, so historians can still access Hamster's enormousArcade Archivesseries and Digital Eclipse's masterful work on various collections, not to mention its excellentGold Masterline.
The vast ocean of incredible indie games should speak for itself at this stage; one of Nintendo's greatest strengths this gen has been fully embracing the community of smaller devs. More surprisingly, Switch has also held its own with larger third-party devs, too, and signs point to that support expanding on Switch 2, and that includes games from other platform holders.
Switch isn't far off becoming a brilliantPlayStation history lesson, and even first-party Sony is starting to turn up withMLBandLEGO Horizon. Throw in potential support from Microsoft withCall of Dutyandrumours of other ports, plus the wider world of modern games and other firms eager to mitigate rising production costs across multiple platforms, and we're entering an era of unprecedented cross-platform support. Another win for anybody with a Switch 2.
There's also the small matter of whatever Nintendo's got bubbling on the stove in its Kyoto kitchens. Internal devs have been beavering away while partner studios have handled most first-party output since Mario Wonder. I'm expecting the biggest hitters on Nintendo's bench to come out swinging in April. A 3D Mario, naturally (it's the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros., remember), but anything except a full-blown 3D Zelda is possible. And there area couple of potential Wii U portsthat could tide us over nicely in the Hylian department, too.
Switch sales have slowed dramaticallyin the last year- not unexpectedly considering the system's age (it's going into itsninthyear in March). As any Captain F. Obvious can tell you, Nintendo needs the energy, excitement, and profit that new hardware generates, but day-one demand is likely to be colossal. Stockpiling inventory makes eminent sense, even ifanalysts, investors, and fans alikeare gagging for it ASAP.
Could the next mainline Mario be total toilet? Of course. Past evidence suggests it'll probably be quite good, though, and Switch 2 will likely have other quite good games. Nintendo's software batting average isquite good.
Even considering that history, though, Switch is the only console I remember buying on launch day. I got a Wii in its first month, but I'd never walked out of a store carrying the new hotness on the very first day before. It worked out rather well but a day-one purchase felt like a real gamble given the fate of Wii U, even for a card-carrying Nintendophile desperate to play BOTW on the bus.
Conversely,thisNintendo console feels like the surest possible bet for fans of the medium, even knowing practically nothing about its launch lineup. The historical library that took years to build up on previous systems is all just going to be there!
Well, almost all. As Nintendo hasmentioned(though not yet detailed), there will be""exceptions"". A background graphic on its website showsvarious games presumably playable; the likelihood is that onlyoutliersemploying peripherals and modes involving the IR sensor will be technically incompatible. Pour one out forLabo.
Beyond that, all signs point to Switch 2 being a brilliantly comprehensive overview of Nintendo history from launch day. Despite many unanswered questions, and not forgetting my professional obligation to get involved from the beginning (a golden excuse, granted), the possibility of buyer's remorse has never been lower for a Nintendo console. I've never been more eager to get stuck in on day one.
Whenever that is.

"Um dos gêneros mais populares e importantes dos videogames na última década foi o soulslike. Encabeçado pela FromSoftware e títulos como Dark Souls, Bloodborne e, mais recentemente, Elden Ring, essa categoria derivada dos RPGs de ação reverbera sucessos há 10 anos. Para embarcar nessa onda, a desenvolvedora Neople e a publicadora Nexon criaram The First Berserker: Khazan, novo soulslike baseado no universo do aqui no Brasil quase desconhecido Dungeon Fighter Online, que deixa as raízes de Dark Souls de lado para se inspirar em Nioh e nos soulslikes da Team Ninja.
Durante as minhas mais de 35 horas de jogo, pude encontrar muitas qualidades no combate e construção de builds baseadas nos inúmeros itens que podemos combinar, mas me senti extremamente entediado com um level design fraco, uma repetição de inimigos no mínimo esquisita e personagens desinteressantes. The First Berserker: Khazan é um jogo muito intenso para o bem e para o mal, mas consegue demonstrar proeminência naquilo que se propõe a ser: um soulslike desafiador.
Com uma narrativa um tanto quanto comum em histórias de brucutus em busca de vingança, o jogo segue esse mesmo caminho e nos apresenta Khazan, um poderoso general do império de Pell Los, que é condenado injustamente e exilado para montanhas nevadas por traição ao imperador. No entanto, o acaso do destino faz com que ele seja “salvo” por um espírito maligno que o possui e assim começa uma longa jornada de vingança. A premissa é bastante básica, mas a extensão do universo faz com que a narrativa ganhe camadas de profundidade, embora nenhuma delas consiga tornar o enredo cativante de verdade.
Mesmo com reviravoltas mirabolantes, a trama de traição se mantém clichê do início ao fim e em diversos momentos é sonolenta. Os personagens de suporte também são imemoráveis e apenas uma se destacou para mim entre aliados e inimigos: Elamein. Apesar de o vilão ser bom, ele não sustenta a trama fraca. A história é definitivamente o ponto mais baixo do jogo, mas que não pesa tanto graças ao combate sólido e eficiente – pelo menos na maioria das vezes.
O ponto de maior destaque e brilho de The First Berserker: Khazan é, sem dúvidas, o combate. Extremamente fluido, veloz, intenso, cheio de variedade de armas e habilidades. O game é um soulslike bastante voltado para o parry, mas não de uma forma semelhante a Sekiro. Aqui, a ausência de escudo obriga você a dominar a habilidade de aparar ataques e de desviar no momento certo, porém a esquiva é curta e muitas vezes é a pior opção para escapar de ataques.
Quando partirmos para o ataque, no entanto, vemos aqui onde a equipe da Neople depositou grande parte dos esforços. Khazan é como uma mistura de Kratos, o Chosen One de Dark Souls e o Lobo de Sekiro — tudo isso parece confuso, mas quando o controlamos as coisas se alinham. O jogo apresenta três opções de arma: lanças, empunhadura dupla com espada e machado e, por fim, a espada de duas mãos. Na minha gameplay, optei pela lança na maior parte do tempo, afinal, o dano me pareceu mais equilibrado e a velocidade de ataque me satisfez mais.
O crescimento da jogabilidade é exponencial: no começo temos combos simples e ataques com dardo — semelhante ao arco e flecha. No entanto, conforme aprofundamos a vasta árvore de habilidades de Khazan, as lutas se tornam mais fluidas, sangrentas e polidas de certa forma. Mesmo assim, não pude deixar de observar que em algumas situações a hitbox me pareceu meio confusa e até mesmo problemática, tanto para inimigos quanto para armadilhas do cenário, mas foram casos bem específicos e que não se repetiram.
Os combos de lança são dinâmicos e se encaixaram perfeitamente na minha gameplay. Consegui acabar com inimigos rapidamente, mas precisamos falar sobre o equilíbrio de dificuldade muito peculiar que o jogo apresenta.
Quanto às batalhas de chefe, algumas são básicas, desde a música e movimentos do inimigo até as arenas, enquanto outras mostram o potencial do jogo e exigem o uso máximo das mecânicas de The First Berserker. Na minha experiência pessoal, nenhuma delas merece grande destaque, exceto a batalha final que é digna de um grande RPG de ação pela magnitude do combate.
Um grande destaque do jogo é a criação de builds que se baseia muito nos sistemas de Nioh. É possível ter muito controle dos status do personagem e adaptar Khazan para a sua arma e jogabilidade. Itens do mesmo set concedem bônus conforme você equipá-los e acumular status.
O único sistema ruim de combate é o de invocações, que não ajudam em nada durante as batalhas de chefe e muitas vezes apenas atrapalham. No entanto, os fantasmas são um bom suporte em lutas rotineiras.
Obviamente, por ser um soulslike, The First Berserker: Khazan possui uma dificuldade acentuada, mas os picos de complexidade em progredir no jogo são… esquisitos. Alguns chefes e mapas iniciais são muito difíceis, enquanto algumas batalhas intermediárias contra inimigos de elite e até mesmo os chefões não apresentam desafio, e, por fim, as batalhas mais avançadas são surpreendentemente fáceis. Isso seria normal caso esses picos de dificuldade fossem parte da progressão que, obviamente, fica menos complexa conforme o avançar do jogo, mas The First Berserker tem uma inconsistência de dificuldade que, a meu ver, mostra uma falha de balanceamento no jogo que empobrece a experiência.
Um dos maiores destaques da FromSoftware em Dark Souls é o mapa minuciosamente conectado que possui atalhos e conexões que exploram a sagacidade dos designers em produzir essas fases. Infelizmente, por optar em se inspirar na Team Ninja e jogos como Nioh e Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, o level design de The First Berserker: Khazan se perde em diversos momentos.
Apesar de contar com áreas vastas e alguns atalhos, muitas regiões do mapa parecem sem vida ou possuem conexões um tanto quanto sem sentido que seriam melhores apenas colocando outra espada da fenda, a “bonfire” do game, para tornar a ligação entre áreas dos biomas mais inteligentes. O jogo poderia olhar mais para Lies of P e criar um level design muito melhor, mas se inspirou justamente em soulslikes com design de mapa problemáticos.
A má qualidade do level design se alinha à repetitividade de inimigos, aspecto ainda mais evidente quando olhamos para as missões secundárias, que reutilizam esses cenários com pequenas mudanças e tornam o jogo cansativo ao longo do tempo.
The First Berserker: Khazan é intenso para o bem e para o mal. Quando o jogo está imerso em seu combate, criação de builds e algumas batalhas de chefe, ele brilha e muito, quase alcançando a prateleira dos ótimos soulslikes. Contudo, o level design ruim, repetição de inimigos, história sonolenta e dificuldade inconsistente fazem ele cair de patamar e ser só mais um soulslike, embora ainda figure entre os bons títulos do gênero, não mais do que isso. Os amantes de Nioh e de jogatinas difíceis encontrarão muita diversão em mais de 35 horas de campanha."

"Marvel dropped a surprise announcement today in the form of a nearly five-and-a-half-hour livestream that revealed the cast of Avengers: Doomsday. A new chair was added every 10-15 minutes with the name of an actor who will be part of this highly-anticipated film, and there were some big surprisesalongside the return of familiar faces.

As expected, the internet at large had some very entertaining and insightful reactions to the news, including the return of Channing Tatum's Gambit and other X-Men to this big movie that will see the MCU's Avengers take on Robert Downey Jr.'s Doctor Doom. We've gathered some of our favorites below and would love to hear your thoughts in the comment section as well
All in all, there were 27 chairs for 27 actorswho will be part of Avengers: Doomsday, and it all started with Chris Hemsworth (Thor). There weren't too many surprising reveals at the start as we learned Vanessa Kirby (Sue Storm), Anthony Mackie (Captain America), Sebastian Stan (Bucky), and Letitia Wright (Black Panther), would be part of the film. The first big moment, however, came when the chair of Paul Rudd (Ant-Man) was shown. Unlike the others, Rudd's chair was a bit smaller as a nod to his ability to shrink in size. As@JuanEditsnoted, ""the little chair announcing Paul Rudd is back as Ant-Man is genius ngl.""
the little chair announcing paul rudd is back as ant man is genius nglpic.twitter.com/JYuc5h5sAu
The chairs continued to reveal that other actors like Wyatt Russell (U.S. Agent), Tenoch Huerta MejÍa (Namor), Ebon Moss-Bacharach (The Thing), Simu Liu (Shang-Chi), and Florence Pugh (Yelena Belova) will be part of Avengers: Doomsday, but this was also the point were some people started poking fun at how long this whole process was taking.
This was summed up quite nicely byHeavy Spoilers,who shared a clip from Saving Private Ryan of Matt Damon growing old very quickly.
Me by the time the full Avengers Doomsday line-up gets announcedpic.twitter.com/AThBwqPPbk
Simu Liualso took the time to celebrate this moment of Shang-Chi's return with a funny joke; ""*pokes head out of karaoke booth*""
The next chair was another one the biggest surprise of the stream as it opened so many possibilities. Yes, it was confirmed that Kelsey Grammer would be returning as Beast after hispost-credits appearance in The Marvels.This was the long-awaited official confirmation that the X-Men will be part of Avengers: Doomsday. The fun didn't stop there either as it was also unveiled that Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Ian McKellen (Magneto), James Marsden (Cyclops), Rebecca Romijn (Mystique), and Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler) would be joining the roster as well.
While there was a lot of excitement about these additions, it started to have MCU fans like@ResonantJusticequestion if this was the early signs ofAvengers: Doomsday secretly being an Avengers vs. X-Men moviewith Downey Jr.'s Doctor Doom pulling the strings.
Is Avengers: Doomsday secretly an Avengers vs X-Men movie, just with RDJ as Doom pulling the strings in the background? 🤔 Looking more and more like it….pic.twitter.com/RqGb7LNjNg
IGN writerCarlos Alonzo Moralesalso put forth a theory that Doctor Doom will kill ""most of the OG X-Men in this movie as his big 'what a bastard!' moment, freeing up budget for the more traditional MCU cast to be in the next one. He likely causes an Incursion of the Fox universe so we know what the stakes are for Secret Wars.""
While we may have to wait until May 1, 2026, to find out what secrets Avengers: Doomsday holds, there was one major surprise left for today's big reveal - Channing Tatum's Gambit will actually be returning after his appearance in Deadpool & Wolverine.
I could share how special this moment was, but I thought I'd let this clip of@BrandonDavisBD, @FitDadCEO, and @KhleoThomasdo the heavy lifting.
Gambit got hands down the biggest pop of the entire 5.5 hour live stream. HE'S BACK@KhleoThomas@fitdadceopic.twitter.com/v0wNwGgjNR
We wrote about how2024 became the year of Gambit,but now it's looking like 2026 may be his biggest moment yet.
The stream ended with Robert Downey Jr. appearing on camera with his chair, and that was it! Well, RDJ did comment onMarvel Studios' Instagram postabout this big reveal, saying, ""That's what u call a deep bench of talent... actually it's more like a row, but an extra long one... that must be it... right?"" To which Marvel Studios responded, ""there's always room for more...""
There were a lot of exciting reveals today, butthe characters not announced for Avengers: Doomsdaywere just as big a talking point. We may have already known thatElizabeth Olsen's Scarlet WitchandBenedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strangewould not be part of this first film, but some of the more shocking omissions were Spider-Man, Hulk, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, Rhodey, Wolverine, Storm, Jean Grey, Rogue, Deadpool, Valkyrie, Korg, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Young Avengers, Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, Spectrum, Binary, Wong, Agatha Harkness, Daredevil, Kate Bishop, Blade, and so many more.
Yes, we know Marvel has atonof characters and also wants to keep some character reveals a big secret, but this didn't stop the Internet from sharing their sadness about their favorite characters not getting a chair.

There were some fans, like@blurayangel,who had a cooler head and reminded everyone that Avengers: Doomsday is just the beginning and Avengers: Secret Wars is just behind the corner on May 7, 2027.
""If you thought the chair announcement of Avengers: Doomsday was insane... just wait for the cast of Avengers: Secret Wars,"" @blurayangel wrote. ""WESLEY SNIPES. HUGH JACKMAN. TOBEY MAGUIRE.""
We love your wishful thinking! And you never know, dreams can come true!
It's also important to note that, as@demetherselfpoints out, only five of the 27 chairs revealed for today's Avengers: Doomsday cast reveal belonged to women. Here's hoping that divide shrinks in the final film.
""Out of 27 announced cast members for Avengers: Doomsday, only 5 are women,"" @demetherself wrote. ""That’s not just a small number, it’s a glaring reminder of how skewed things still are. How does this ratio even happen?""
To end this reaction roundup, we had to share some of the funniest posts from people and brands who casted some of their favorite character from completely unrelated shows and films and much more.

"Hideo Kojima took to the stage at SXSW 2025 in Austin, TX this evening to reveal an epic new trailer forDeath Stranding 2: On the Beach, as well as confirm a release date.

Death Stranding 2 launches on June 26, 2025 exclusively on PlayStation 5. However, those who buy the Digital Deluxe Edition or the Collector’s Edition get two days of early access from June 24.
The 10-minute long video, below, includes various cinematics, gameplay clips, and, perhaps most notably, a close look at a character who many are already saying looks a lot like Snake from Kojima's world famous Metal Gear franchise.
The character, Neil, played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli, is seen putting on a bandanna, as Snake does, before leading a team of creepy looking soldiers. The similarity to Solid Snake is remarkable.
Perhaps Marinelli's Snake-like role in Death Stranding 2 shouldn't come as much of a surprise. In a 2020Instagram post, Kojima heaped praise on the actor, saying that if he wore a bandanna he'd be a ""spitting image"" of Solid Snake.
""There are many actors that I follow,"" Kojima said at the time. ""Luca Marinelli recently caught my eye after watching The Old Guard and Martin Eden. He played an impressive villain in They Call Me Jeeg Robot, but I think that he will break out soon, and his popularity will increase. Also, I think if he donned a bandanna, he’d be a spitting image of Solid Snake!""
The trailer continues the Metal Gear vibes with the Magellan Man, a huge tar-like creature fused with the DHV Magellan that looks a bit like Metal Gear Rex (a 15"" statue of the Magellan Man is included in the Collector's Edition). The Magellan Man appears to be operated like a Pacific Rim-style mech, and faces off against enormous and very creepy tar monsters.
The standard edition of Death Stranding 2 costs $69.99, as expected. The Collector's Edition, meanwhile, costs $229.99. The Digital Deluxe Edition costs $79.99. Pre-orders begin on March 17.
Continuing the story ofDeath Stranding, which has had over 19 million players worldwide since its release on November 8, 2019, Death Stranding 2 carries the tagline, 'Should We Have connected?' Here's the official blurb:
Meanwhile, Kojima announced the Death Stranding global concert tour, dubbed The Strands of Harmony World Tour. Set for 19 cities across the globe, the concerts will feature an orchestra and singers performing selections from Ludvig Forssell's critically acclaimed scores alongside music from other artists featured in the games. Synchronised HD video projections will accompany the performances, showing moments from both Death Stranding and its sequel. The premiere is on November 8, 2025, the sixth anniversary of Death Stranding's release, at the Sydney Opera House.
It's a hugely busy time for Kojima and his studio, Kojima Productions. As well as Death Stranding 2, Kojima is working on a live-actionDeath Stranding filmwith A24, the studio behind Academy Award winning films such as Everything Everywhere All At Once. He's also working onODfor Xbox Game Studios, and video game and movie hybridPhysintfor Sony.
There are no release dates for OD or Physint. Indeed, in January,Kojima revealed the ongoing video game actors strike had affected production on both titles, so it may be some time before we hear or see more.

"Don’t hold your breath forThe Witcher 4. According to the developers at CD Projekt, it won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest.

Speaking in afinancial calloutlining projections of future profits, CD Projekt said: “Even though we do not plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026, we are still driven by this financial goal. And although it’s very ambitious, we stand a chance of achieving it within the given timeframe.”
That rules out a launch this year, which no-one really expected, a launch next year, which some had hoped for, and sets 2027 as the earliest The Witcher 4 will come out. But that’s if everything goes to plan, and as we all know, the video game industry has a hard time with its plans. Could The Witcher 4 end up being a 2028 game? It sounds possible.
Either way, 2027 at the earliest suggests The Witcher 4 may well end up targeting the next-generation of consoles, with Sony no-doubt working on its PlayStation 6 plans as we speak, andMicrosoft rumored to be targeting a 2027 release for its Xbox Series X successor and an Xbox handheld. But is it a cross-gen game, as Cyberpunk 2077 was when it released in December 2020?
If it is a cross-gen game, with a version for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, could The Witcher 4 end up working on Nintendo Switch 2? It seems unlikely at face value, but The Witcher 3 ended up on the Switch, so miracles do happen.
Here's what we know: The Witcher 4 is the first in a new trilogy of Witcher games set after the events of The Witcher 3. But rather than star Geralt as protagonist, Ciri is the main character this time around.
Speaking exclusively to IGN ahead of The Witcher 4 reveal, executive producer Małgorzata Mitręga said Ciri was “the very organic, logical choice.”
“It was always about her, starting from Saga when you read it in the books. She's an amazing, layered character. And of course, as a protagonist we said goodbye to Geralt previously. So this is a continuation. I guess for all of us it’s like she was meant to be. That was always her.”
In January, speaking to IGN as part of a wider interview on Netflix’s upcoming animated film,The Witcher: Sirens of The Deep,Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle backed CD Projekt’s decision, even though it sees Geralt take a back seat.
“I'm really excited,” he said. “I think it's a really good move. I mean, I always thought that continuing the Saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons, but mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because people, I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done.”
And in February,the director ofThe Witcher 4clarified that a new video featured the same in-game model of Ciri after some had thought her face looked different.
We’ve got plenty more exclusive content on The Witcher 4, includinga trailer breakdownand an interview with CD Projekt where the developer explainswhy The Witcher 4 will avoid a Cyberpunk 2077-style launch disaster.

"Michael Sarnoski, director of A Quiet Place: Day One, is reportedly set to write and direct the live-action adaptation of Kojima Productions' Death Stranding.

PerDeadline, Sarnoski will write and direct the Death Stranding adaptation with A24 and Kojima Productions producing, alongside Square Peg. Sarnoski directed and wrote for both theA Quiet Place spin-off Day Oneand2021's Pig, starring Nicolas Cage. He's also the writer/director for the upcomingThe Death of Robin Hood, another A24 project.
Few details were given about what the live-action adaptation of Death Stranding would entail. The original 2019 game sent players out into the wasteland to try and reconnect a scattered America amid an extinction-level event, in a world haunted by nightmarish creatures and strange happenings. It's already good movie fodder before you factor in Hideo Kojima's cinematic tendencies.
Death Stranding also featured a star-studded cast that included Norman Reedus in the lead role of Sam Bridges, as well as Léa Seydoux, Mads Mikkelsen, Guillermo del Toro, and Margaret Qualley. It'll be interesting to see if these actors reprise their roles for the live-action adaptation.
There's still more for Death Stranding in store though, asKojima Productions recently confirmed Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will launchlater this year on June 26, 2025 on PlayStation 5. The next game in the Death Stranding saga also picked up some more stars, including the likes of Luca Marinelli and Elle Fanning.
Hopefully this particular Kojima-linked project forges ahead, as theMetal Gear Solid movie is still reportedly being worked ondespite slowing updates. With all the stars and cinematics though, Death Stranding certainly seems poised to make the jump to live-action.

"Finding a good deal on Apple products is rough, which is why I focused on all of these daily deals today. Finding multiple Apple deals, plus discounts on Zelda and Final Fantasy collectibles? It's my gamer-tech jackpot. Right now, you can save onAirPods Pro 2, grab aMagSafe leather case for just $11.99, and even score afour-pack of AirTags for under $70.

If you’re in the market forwireless earbuds,power adapters, or anApple Watchband, there are plenty of options at all-time low prices. And you know by now I like to pop in some really cool gaming stuff. How about a full-sizedMaster Sword replicathat plays Zelda music when you swing it and aFinal Fantasy I-VI bundlethat brings the pixel-perfect RPG classics back to life?
Upgrade your tech, complete your Zelda shrine, or relive Final Fantasy’s golden era, these deals are worth checking out. Some discounts like the iPhone 14 Plus MagSafe case, are downright ridiculous at 80% off. But Apple deals never last long (Tim Cook loves that Apple tax), and limited collectibles definitely sell out fast. If something catches your eye, now’s the time to add to cart before the price jumps back up.
AliExpress is offering this Arzopa 15"" 1080p USB Type-C portable monitor for only $57 shipped after you apply coupon code ""IFPQHLH"". We've posted deals on this portable monitor in the past, but this is the lowest price we've seen thus far. The marketplace vendor is Arzopa itself so you're getting the full manufacturer's warranty on this brand new, retail packaged item. This monitor is primarily designed to be a secondary display for a laptop, but the S1's 1080p 60Hz panel is a great match for the Nintendo Switch's hardware, since the Switch only supports up to 720p @ 60Hz anyway.
For only $22 more, you can upgrade to the higher end Arzopa Z1FC USB portable monitor, now only $79.19 after coupon code ""IFPQHLH"". It's currently $117 on Amazon. The Z1FC's upgrades include a larger display (16.1"" vs 15.6""), a higher refresh rate (144Hz vs. 60Hz), and better color reproduction (100% sRGB color gamut). This is a better monitor than the S1 to pair with the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally because both gaming handhelds can support refresh rates up to 144Hz.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.

"Video game companies across Japan have suffered a dramatic stock market plunge sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

White House officials signalled what they describe as specific reciprocal tariffs on roughly 60 of the ""worst offenders"" to go into effect on 9 April. Japan is one of the countries subject to these customised tariff rates, at 24%.
Trump's officials say these countries charge higher tariffs on U.S. goods, impose ""non-tariff"" barriers to U.S. trade, or have otherwise acted in ways they feel undermine American economic goals.
Tariffs are essentially taxes placed on the cost of importing certain goods. While it's possible for companies in the supply chain to simply eat these costs, more often than not these taxes are passed onto consumers. And unfortunately for gamers, rising prices are very likely to impact tech and gaming goods.
Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark index closed down 7.8%, the ASX 200 in Australia lost 4.2%, and the Kospi in South Korea ended 5.6% lower. The Shanghai Composite closed 7.3% lower and Taiwan Weighted Index lost 9.7%. The Hang Seng was down by 12.5% in afternoon trading.
Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, rounded up the decline in video game stocks based in Japan as the market opening in the morning of April 7. Nintendo was down 7.35%, Sony 10.16%, Capcom 7.13%, and Sega 6.57%.
It's Monday 10am in Japan where Japanese game stocks currently react to these insultingly dumb tariffs like so:Nintendo -7.35%Sony -10.16%Bandai Namco -7.03%Konami -3.93%Sega -6.57%Koei Tecmo -5.83%Capcom -7.13%Square Enix -5.23%The mobile game companies do even worse.
Last week Nintendo shocked the video game world by announcinga delay to pre-orders of the Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S., blaming tariffs and the uncertainty they have caused across the world. The pre-orders were set to go live on April 9, but in the U.S. specifically they were postponed, with the June 5 release date said to be on-track. Pre-orders go live elsewhere on April 9 as planned.
Nintendo announced the Switch 2 at $449.99, with a Mario Kart World bundle priced $499.99.Mario Kart World itself is priced $79.99.
Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad had warnedthat Trump's surprise tariffs on countries such as Vietnam, where Nintendo had shifted some of its Switch 2 manufacturing in anticipation of U.S. tariffs on China, might have caused a rethink.
""While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset U.S. tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world,"" Ahmad said. ""The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect.""
Nintendo fansandanalystsare now concerned Nintendo will raise the price of the Switch 2 and its games even further, even asit suffers a backlash to its pricing following the console’s reveal.
There are question marks over Sony, too, which manufactures PlayStation consoles, including the $700 PlayStation 5 Pro. IGN has asked the company if it has any comment on the prospect of increased prices in the U.S.
Goldman Sachs now forecasts there is a 45% chance the U.S. will fall into recession in the next 12 months, up from a previous estimate of 35%. JPMorgan now sees a 60% chance of a U.S. and global economic downturn.
According to a report by theBBC, Trump has defended the tariffs, saying ""sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.""

"Rockstar’s new and improved version ofGrand Theft Auto 5isn’t going down well on Steam following its launch earlier in March.

Grand Theft Auto 5 Enhanced, which released on March 4, has a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, with 54% of the 19,772 user reviews flagged as positive.
To put that into context, the original GTA 5 on Steam, now unlisted at the request of Rockstar Games and as a result unable to appear in search on Valve's platform, has a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam.
In fact, GTA 5 Enhanced is currently the worst user-reviewed GTA on Steam, with its closest competitor for the unwanted crown,Grand Theft Auto III – The Definitive Edition, on 66% positive reviews.
GTA 5 Enhanced is a free upgrade for GTA 5 on PC that includes sought-after features previously only available in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S versions ofGTA Online— including all the latest vehicles and performance upgrades available at Hao’s Special Works, animal encounters, and access to purchase a GTA+ Membership — along with improved graphics options and faster loading times. All players who currently own GTA 5 on PC can upgrade to this new version for free, with the ability to migrate your Story Mode and Online progress.
You’d think that would be a relatively straightforward process, but it appears the account migration isn’t working as intended for many players. Indeed, account migration problems are at the heart of most of the negative reviews flagged as ‘most helpful.’
“ ‘The GTA Online profile associated with this Rockstar Games account is not eligible for migration at this time,’ ” reported one disgruntled player. “If you think I'm throwing away nearly 700 hours of gameplay on one character so that you can make a few more bucks off me, then you can lick my anal orifice clean.
“This is an objective downgrade from the ‘old’ version. Gonna pretend this was never released and continue to enjoy Legacy version until the new game comes out when I'm 60.”
“I'm leaving a negative review mainly due to Rockstar deciding that some accounts should arbitrarily not be able to migrate, and if you ask for help from support, they just say they can't do anything about it,” reads another.
""I can't migrate either of my two accounts,"" another negative review reads. ""R* support is completely useless and can't help. With the game being over 10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years old I am sure as hell not going to completely restart all my progress in Online just to get marginally better graphics (if that) and HSW and whatever other minuscule ♥♥♥♥ they added.""
Despite these issues, GTA 5 Enhanced remains one of the most-played games on Steam, with a 187,059 peak concurrent player count since launch. But it has sparked concern over the inevitable PC release ofGrand Theft Auto 6, with some PC gamers worrying that Rockstar's struggles with GTA 5 Enhanced could signal launch trouble down the line.
GTA 6 is planned for launch during the fall of 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only, leaving PC gamers out in the cold. In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstarattempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hitsconsole, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.
We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including Take-Two boss StraussZelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out. Meanwhile,Take-Two has sued online marketplace PlayerAuctions, alleging it contains ""thousands of listings for unauthorized, infringing GTA 5 content – including heavily modified player accounts, in-game assets, and virtual currency – all gained by using hacking software, cheats, and technical exploits.""
And in other news,Rockstar recently acquiredGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Editiondeveloper Video Games Deluxeand renamed it Rockstar Australia.

"Withthe wait for The Witcher 4 set to head into 2027, it’s a similar story for Naughty Dog’s recently announcedIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.

Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier took toResetErato say neither The Witcher 4 nor Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will be out next year.
That means like The Witcher 4, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will be released in 2027 at the earliest. And, like The Witcher 4, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will face questions around whether or not it’s targeting the PlayStation 5 or the inevitable PlayStation 6, or, perhaps most likely, is a cross-gen game.
If Intergalactic heads straight to PS6, Naughty Dog faces the prospect of having skipped the PS5 generation in terms of brand new games. So far, the studio has released ports, remasters, and remakes on Sony’s current-gen console, including The Last of Us Part II, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, The Last of Us Part I, and The Last of Us Part II Remastered.
Naughty Dog revealed Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet at The Game Awards 2024. It features a star-studded cast that includes Tati Gabrielle from the Uncharted movie as protagonist Jordan A. Mun, and Kumail Nanjiani of Marvel's Eternals as a man called Colin Graves.
But fans have analysed the trailer, below,to piece together the rest of the cast, and though it focuses on just a couple of characters, a photo of what appears to be a crew revealed even more.
Earlier this month, The Last of Us director Neil Druckmannshared more details aboutIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.
In aninterviewwith Alex Garland, the writer of zombie movie 28 Days Later, Druckmann talked candidly about the development process, confirming Intergalactic had been in the works for four years already.
""I joke about this with the team. We made a game,The Last of Us 2, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game,"" Druckmann said, to which Garland joked: ""Who gives a shit?""
""Exactly,"" Druckmann added. ""But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about — let's make a game about faith and religion.""
Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet takes place in an alternate historical timeline and features a ""pretty prominent religion,"" too, which has ""changed and bastardized and evolved"" over the years.
""This whole religion takes place on this one planet, and then at one point, all communication stops,"" Druckmann teased. ""And you're playing a bounty hunter that's chasing her bounty, and she crash lands on this planet.
""So many of the previous games we've done, there's always, like, an ally with you,"" he said. ""I really want you to be lost in a place that you're really confused about what happened here, who are the people here, what was their history. And in order to get off this planet — again, no one has been heard from this planet for 600 years or so — if you ever have hoped to have a chance to get off, you have to figure out what happened here.""
Assuming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet releases in 2027, and taking into account Druckmann’s comment about it being in development for four years so far, by the time the game comes out it will have been in the works for six years.
It’s a pretty long wait, but speaking to IGN on the red carpet ahead of The Last of Us Season 2 premiere, Druckmann said that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is not only playable right now, but “really good.”
“I will say we are playing it at the office and it's incredible,” Druckmann teased. “It's really good. I'm so excited to finally put gameplay out into the world and show people about it, because we just showed you the very, very, very tip on the iceberg. The game goes pretty deep beyond that.”

"Death Stranding 2: On the Beachgot a new trailer over the weekend, alongside a release date, collector's edition, box art, and more. And as fans have pored over the details, one has noticed a fun connection to director Hideo Kojima's past work: Metal Gear Solid 2.

The box art for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach shows Sam ""Porter"" Bridges, portrayed by Norman Reedus, holding the child ""Lou,"" who players of the first game will recognize.Reddit user ReverseTheFlashposted ""He did it again,"" showing that box art alongside a Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty slipcase with a similar motif.
The Metal Gear Solid 2 promo shows Japanese singer Gackt holding a child in a similar composition. Though it's not a one-for-one, it's certainly fun to note the similarities between the two covers. It's also a reminder of a strange branch of Metal Gear Solid (out-of-universe) backstory.
During the run-up to the game's release, Gackt was featured inmultiplepromosfor Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. Part of this, it seems, included special slip-covers for the game in some territories, which have resulted in random MGS ephemera that'sboth intrigued and confused people over the years.
In case you're wondering why Gackt, specifically, was so involved with Metal Gear Solid 2's promotional campaign,Kojima offered an explanation in 2013. The reason he asked Gackt to ""be on MGS2's TVCM is 'MGS1' was about DNA & 'MGS2' MEME. DNA consists 'AGTC', adding 'K' of KOJIMA becomes 'GACKT.' "" So, there's that.
Considering Death Stranding 2's new trailer hasplenty of Metal Gear vibes in it, it's no surprise fans are drawing the parallels here. Personally, I think any similarities are, at most, a sign of recurring ideas across Kojima's games. But still, it's fun to speculate and ponder, and it's always a good time to travel down memory lane with a promotional cover featuring Gackt.
Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launches on June 26, 2025 exclusively on PlayStation 5.

"Atomfalllooks like a hit, with 1.5 million players reached and, ahem, 300,000 cups of tea drank.

Rebellion’s brand new IP set in the north of England is the company’s most successful launch in its 32-year history, it said. Rebellion is the developer behind the popular Sniper Elite series of games, as well as the spin-off Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army entries.
Here's the official blurb:
“We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall,” said Jason Kingsley CBE, CEO and co-founder of Rebellion.
“To have surpassed the 1 million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off.
“We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series.
“We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game.”
While Atomfall launched simultaneously across PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series X and S and Xbox One,it also released on Game Pass as a day-one title, which will have significantly boosted player numbers.
Rebellion did not say how many copies of the game were sold, however, preferring, like Assassin’s Creed Shadows maker Ubisoft, to go down the player number route. But it did provide some fun stats to back up it announcement.
Over 316,000 Atomfall players, for example, have killed the scientist at the very beginning of the game. In total there have been over 3.7 million kills using the cricket bat, while over 4 million pasties and 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed.
IGN'sAtomfall reviewreturned an 8/10. We said: ""Atomfall is a compelling, post-apocalyptic survival story that satisfyingly bends to your choices and discoveries no matter which direction you take.""

"Horizon actor Ashly Burch has addressed the AI Aloy video that leaked online last week, using it to call attention to the demands of striking voice actors.

Last week,The Vergereported on the emergence ofan internal Sony video showing off tech that uses Aloy from the Horizon series to demonstrate AI-powered characters. Sony has yet to respond to IGN’s request for comment.
In the now deleted video, Sony Interactive Entertainment director of software engineering, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, has a conversation with an AI-powered Aloy via voice prompts and AI-generated speech and facial animations. Raghoebardajal asks Aloy how she's doing, to which she responds: ""Hello, I'm managing alright. Just dealing with a sore throat. How have you been?""
The voice heard coming from Aloy's mouth is clearly not that of Burch, rather a robotic voice similar to those heard from text-to-speech voice generators. AI Aloy's facial movements are stiff and her eyes appear lifeless as she converses with Raghoebardajal.
Burch, who has voiced Aloy in all four Horizon video games released so far (Zero Dawn, Forbidden West, Call of the Mountain, and Lego Horizon Adventures) took to social media platform TikTok to confirm that she had seen the video, and that Horizon developer Guerrilla had got in touch to let her know that the tech demo did not reflect anything that was in active development, nor did it use any of Burch’s performance (facial or voice data). That presumably rules out AI Aloy forthe upcoming Horizon multiplayer game, assuming the character is in the game, and the inevitable Horizon 3. However, as Burch pointed out, Guerrilla (and parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment) owns Aloy as a character.
With all this in mind, Burch said the AI Aloy video left her feeling “worried about game performance as an art form,” and used it as a jumping off point to discuss the ongoing video game voice actors strike that has claimed a number of high-profile casualties in recent weeks.
Last week, the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) issued an update to its members on the status of negotiations over video game actor AI protections, saying that while progress had been made, it was still ""frustratingly far apart"" with the industry bargaining group on key issues.
“Currently what we’re fighting for is, you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form, you have to compensate us fairly, and you have to tell us how you’re using this AI double,” Burch said.
“I feel worried not because the technology exists. Not even because game companies want to use it. Of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements. I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it, that does have someone’s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections, any way to fight back. And that possibility, it makes me so sad it hurts my heart. It scares me. I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances. I want to be able to continue to do this job. If we don’t win, that future is really compromised.
“I’m genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on blast,” Burch continued. “Certainly not Guerrilla. The technology isn’t the problem. Game companies wanting to use the technology isn’t the problem. The problem is we’re currently on strike and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections.
“I support the strike. I’ve always supported the strike. I believe fighting is what we have to do to protect the future and the longevity of this career that we all love so much.”
Burch then pointed to the temporary union contracts that currently give all the protections the striking voice actors are asking for, that any video game company can sign right now. “There’s the interim, the tiered, and low budget agreement contracts available right now for any game company to sign,” Burch said. “I believe we deserve to be protected.”
let us speak on AI aloy
Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI.The game failed, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”
Still, that hasn’t put off a number of video game companies from using generative AI in the development of their products.Activision recently disclosed the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assetsas part of new requirements on Steam, amid a backlash to an ""AI slop"" zombie Santa loading screen.
And the voice actor strike has begun to impact a number of video games. Players have reported that games such as Destiny 2 and World of Warcraft appear to have certain NPCs left unvoiced in otherwise voiced scenes, likely due to the strike. Late last year, SAG-AFTRA struck League of Legends after Riotallegedly tried to subvert the strike by canceling a game in response. And Activision confirmedCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 characters were recastafter players expressed concern about new voices.
Just last week,two Zenless Zone Zero voice actors revealedthey learned they'd been replaced when they saw the game's latest patch notes.
Head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash recentlyweighed in on AI to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamerswho seek ""personalization across everything.""
""For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning.""

"Assassin’s Creed Shadows has seen over 3 million players since launch, Ubisoft has announced.

The player milestone comes seven days after Shadows launched on May 20, and is up from the 2 million reported on day two, surpassing the launches of both Origins and Odyssey.
Other stats reported by Ubisoft today were already revealed by IGN’s coverage of an internal email in which the company contextualized Shadows’ opening weekend performance, sayingit’s better compared to Origins and Odyssey rather than the “perfect storm” 2020’s Valhalla launched into.
Shadows saw the second highest day one sales revenue in Assassin's Creed franchise history, behind only Valhalla, the biggest Ubisoft day one ever on the PlayStation Store, and has seen over 40 million hours played so far.
There is enormous pressure onAssassin's Creed Shadowsto do well for Ubisoft globally after a number of delays and the sales failure of last year’sStar Wars Outlaws. Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number ofhigh-profile flops,layoffs,studio closures, andgame cancellationsin the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release.
Things got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family wasreportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investorson a buyout deal that would let it preserve control of the company's intellectual property. So, the video game world is watching Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ early performance closely for signs of its success — or failure.
There’s also a lot of attention on Shadows’ Steam concurrents, which are being compared to those of other triple-A single-player games that recently released, as well as previous Assassin’s Creed games on Valve’s platform.
Shadows became the most-played Assassin's Creed game ever on Steam over the weekend with 64,825 peak concurrent players, although it’s worth noting that it was the first game in the series to launch day-one there since 2018's Odyssey. BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardsaw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.
It’s hard to make a call on whether Shadows is below, meeting, or exceeding Ubisoft’s expectations without knowing what those expectations were, a revenue figure, or a sales figure.
Money talks, of course, and irrespective of player numbers and engagement, it will be revenue brought in by Assassin’s Creed Shadows that determines the fate of not just the game, but Ubisoft itself. We may not get a clear picture of that until Ubisoft's next financial report in the coming months.

"Gaming fans are feeling the heat after Nintendo announced itsSwitch 2 U.S. pre-order date was delayedas a direct result of the newly announced tariffs posed by the Trump Administration.

Wednesday morning, Nintendo fully unveiled its hybrid console sequel alongside plans to open pre-orders come April 9 — news thatDonald Trump would soon implement sweeping tariffs across the globearrived just hours later. It was a moment of whiplash that the industry is still struggling to come to grips with, and now, two days later, the average gaming fan is already feeling the impact.
“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,” Nintendo said in a statement shared with IGN. “Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”
I really hate being right. I kept telling folks that things can literally change tomorrow. People kept yelling at me that the tariffs won't affect us...aight man 😒
46% tariff on Vietnamese imports announced now.Nintendo Switch 2 are produced there…It’s so fucking over.pic.twitter.com/5N1iAMI2Jm
they’re gonna make it even more expensivepic.twitter.com/5Y8FL9FZF6
“Wait a minute… are you sayingwehave to pay the tariffs??” oneReddit user commented. “Who could have possibly foreseen this?!”
While pre-order timing for other territories, including the UK, remains unchanged, Nintendo didn’t mince words when it came to how tariffs will affect those in the United States. However, changes to a release schedule, even when it comes to something as simple as pre-order timing, signal that Nintendo has more on its mind than it has revealed thus far.
There were fears that Nintendo’s proposed $450 Switch 2 price and$80 gamesmight be too big of an ask pre-tariffs — amovement aiming to get Nintendo to lower its price plansalready began shortly after that initial reveal — but the struggle for affordable games is just getting started. While someanalysts had suggestedSwitch 2 prices were calculated with potential tariffs in mind, Nintendo’s announcement today suggests those numbers have room to increase.
So thenThose WERE the pre tariff pricesYeah the Switch and Mario Kart bout to be 650 after taxes
Americans checking the updated Switch 2 prices after complaining about the old oneshttps://t.co/fsC60LU5YEpic.twitter.com/t4RwqXia8J
Nintendo hasn’t announced when or if its Switch 2 prices will change, but there is plenty of reason to worry they will shift in a more expensive direction. What began as a wave of frustration aimed at the current Switch 2 price has now evolved into an ocean of people who, of course, are still angry, but now they are just hoping they’ll be able to afford the new console.
“This unironically frustrates me so much,” anotherReddit user added. “The switch 2 was already going to be quite expensive (compared to the OG) but I was still okay with paying the extra money for it. The games were another blow. Was too expensive already but whatever. But this? Huge tariffsPlus Sales taxPlus tariffs on the games???
“I don’t want to pay 130$ for a damn copy of a game or 600$ for the new Switch. I genuinely (think) this will impact the amount of people able to buy into all of this. I shouldn’t as an average person be priced out of this, yet I probably will be. Augh…”
I feel bad for all my US followers. If you thought the Switch 2 price was expensive before. It looks like its going to get even worse due to new tariffs.
We'vespoken to other industry analystswho acknowledge that these unprecedented tariffs have gamers and game-makers walking into uncharted territory and that there's no telling what exactly will happen with the Switch 2. While some believe we could soon see a price increase, others aren't so sure, but all agree that the industry will no doubt feel the impact of the Trump Administration's wide-reaching tariff plans.
The Switch 2 is Nintendo’s latest groundbreaking console, but a suddenly increased price could be just the start of what’s to come. Wespoke with Entertainment Software Association (ESA) spokesperson Aubrey Quinn to learn more about how Trump’s unprecedented tariffs will impact video game fans moving forward. As many have already feared, the ESA says there’s no reason to believe the damage will stop at Nintendo.
It does not stop at Nintendo Switch 2 btw.-PC parts like CPU's and GPU's are gonna go up-Laptops going up-Anything Tech related is going up.Next PlayStation and Xbox gonna require a blood sacrifice.
The prices of your consoles, tech, and pretty much every daily necessity are about to go up.There's a good chance Nintendo is about to announce a price hike for the Switch 2. Do not be surprised if Sony and Microsoft follow suit.PC market is already screwed.https://t.co/M40UFMyRH5

"Path of Exile 2developer Grinding Gear Games has fully detailed the first major content update since the action RPG’s early access launch last year.

Dawn of the Hunt goes live at 9pm CET on April 4, and adds the new Huntress class. The Huntress is a Spear and Buckler user specialising in hybrid melee and ranged combat. Elsewhere, there are five new ascension classes: the Ritualist, Amazon, Smith of Kitava, Tactician, and Lich.
Players can also expect dozens of new encounters in the endgame, significant mechanical overhauls, over one hundred new unique items as well as significantly expanded crafting options.
The long wait for the Path of Exile 2 early access launch finally came to an end when it released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on December 6, 2024. It saw massive success,securing its place as the 15th most-played game Steam game ever.
But the game ran into issues, both technical and in design. GGG has worked to update the game in the months since, culminating in next month's Dawn of the Hunt release.
At the same time, GGG continues to operate the first Path of Exile game, which still enjoys a healthy playerbase on Steam, as a live service. But this has proved challenging. In January,GGG was forced to apologize to fans of the first gameafter putting a new update on hold until a crucial update for Path of Exile 2 was released.
Meanwhile,Path of Exile 2 has found itself embroiled in an online disputethat revolves around X / Twitter owner Elon Musk’s admission that he paid someone to boost his account. When contacted by IGN, Grinding Gear Games declined to comment.
Obliterate your enemies with the hybrid ranged and melee Huntress
Step into the bloodstained boots of the Huntress, a dexterous and ferocious spear-wielding warrior. Banished from her homeland, she now stalks her prey using both ranged spear throws and close combat attacks. Her brutal arsenal is designed to make combat feel like a relentless pursuit, always in motion, moving into and out of melee range at a moments notice.
The Huntress can also Parry incoming attacks from monsters, stunning them before following up with one of several counterattacks. For example, use Disengage after a Parry to quickly jump back, gaining a Frenzy charge, then follow up with an empowered spear throw.
Stalk your prey with an array of elemental spear attacks that empower the Huntress to use some of the longest combo chains we have created on any class.
Create mayhem with five new ascendancy classesWith five new Ascendancy Classes, Dawn of the Hunt introduces fresh new ways to expand your build options.
Sharpen your arsenal with new skill and support gemsAs well as20 New Spear Skillsdesigned for the huntress, we have two other much anticipated abilities.
This expansion also brings a massive overhaul to character development by addingover 100 new Support Gemsto enhance build diversity. Support gems add a variety of interesting effects to your existing skills, modifying them in game changing ways.
For example, Haemocrystals turn bleed effects into explosive Vaal crystals, and Caltrops allow your existing skills to litter the battlefield with slowing hazards.
Unlock greater potential with Over 100 new Unique ItemsDawn of the Hunt brings a stronger focus on Mid and Endgame Unique items, ensuring high-level characters have more thrilling bounty to chase.
Unbridled power awaits with new crafting toolsNew crafting tools have been introduced as rewards across many areas of the game:
Darkness lurks aheadThe Azmeri Spirit has made itself present in Wraeclast. When approached, these wisps will flee, and monsters it comes into contact with will be infused by it, making them more powerful. Wisps will also find and possess Rare or Unique monsters, granting them powerful new abilities, and powerful new rewards. There are twelve distinct types of wisp, each with their own mechanics and rewards.
New MapsDawn of the Hunt adds eight new Maps offering fresh challenges and rewards. Each of them come with interesting new encounters.
Be forced to fight mirrored Rare monsters in a shifting, warped reality inThe Fractured Lake, or be thrust into the wild Ezomyte Forests ofThe Phaaryl Megalithswhere rune-carved stones surge with energy.  Survive the storm-fueled gauntlet of deadly boss waves, and you’ll earn full boss rewards and exclusive Runes
Unique Strongboxes
Find four new Unique Strongboxes, each with deadly mechanics and valuable rewards.
Corrupted Essences
Essences receive major upgrades, with four new Corrupted Essences -Hysteria, Delirium, Horror, and Insanity- offering new combat mechanics and powerful new crafting outcomes, such as guaranteed double Enchantments when using a Vaal Orb on belts.
Cleanse the CorruptionCorruption has continued to spread throughout Wraeclast and has formed into larger and larger zones. In the centre of each one lies a Corrupted Nexus, the home of three new terrifying bosses, amalgamations of Corruption itself.
Upon defeating these bosses, any remaining areas within the zone of Corruption will become cleansed. Cleansed Maps have additional new monsters, a new boss and their own set of Modifiers and rewards.
Duel with Rogue ExilesOn your travels you will sometimes encounter Rogue Exiles - others like you who have been exiled and are openly hostile. They will challenge you - a fight to the death. These Exiles have capabilities to Dodge Roll, avoid your abilities with smart pathfinding, smart-targeting, and much more action-packed gameplay. Rogue Exiles use the same skills available to players, and even the same items. They aren't just dressed up in those items, they know how to take advantage of the Uniques they are using.
Of course, if you are able to slay these Exiles, those items will all drop on the ground!
Dynamic improvements to endgameDawn of the Hunt significantly rebalances the endgame. The number of towers has been drastically reduced but they have been made much more powerful. Tablets now affect twice as many areas and running higher tier Maps in Towers increases this number further still. In addition, each Tower will be able to consume up to three Tablets at once.
These changes significantly reduce the amount of busy work required in endgame while improving your ability to use them. On top of that, Towers can now spawn with all mechanics, and have their own new Bosses!
Prepare for the HuntRise as a hunter, or fall as prey on April 4th. The Dawn of the Hunt content update will also be made available in existing Early Access leagues for those wishing to play their existing characters. It is recommended to start anew in a fresh economy to get the full, recommended experience in the Dawn of the Hunt leagues.

"Editor’s note: This interview was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior toNintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States due to the potential impact of tariffs. Parts of this interview were edited for clarity.

After getting hands-on with Nintendo Switch 2 at last week’s reveal in New York, IGN spoke with the hardware leads spearheading the development of Nintendo’s newest console. Kouchi Kawamoto and Takuhiro Dohta from Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning and Development Department, along with Tetusya Sasaki from Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, talked to IGN’s Brian Altano about the technology behind Switch 2, the classic Nintendo handhelds that have inspired them and the impact former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata’s legacy had on the development of the console.
IGN:Can you talk about the SOC system on a chip the Nintendo Switch 2 was running? Is it Nvidia Tegra? If not, can you reveal which graphics architecture it's based on?
Nintendo:I think you'll find a lot of the details in NVIDIA's information that they've shared.
IGN:One of the notes in the direct suggested to hit 4K in dock mode, upscaling may be required. What kind of upscaling is this system using? Is it using AI upscaling?
Nintendo:I think probably the main kind of easiest upscaling to use is the DLSS that Nvidia provides. So from that standpoint, I guess you could say this AI.
Nintendo:That said, we're planning on providing other options of upscaling through software and so ranging from something that uses AI to something that's not. I think you'll see that as time passes. And lastly, I'll add that even though there is upscaling, there's also the option to not upscale and just output natively. So that's also an option that developers can use.
IGN:What about ray tracing? Is that something that your team experimented with?
Nintendo:Just like DLSS, that's when we're kind of making the graphics of a game. We consider ray tracing as just another tool to do that – it's not that we're going to try to use ray tracing on everything, but really trying to figure out what types of graphics, what types of screens, what types of situations are best suited for ray tracing, and then trying to apply that. That's the approach we took when we did all of our researching and experimenting.
IGN:We saw that the switch two supports third party cameras. What about third-party mice?
Nintendo:You're talking about USB mice, things like that?
IGN:Yeah, not the animal!
Nintendo:[Laughs] It really depends on the game software with the structure. So if that software supports third-party USB mice, yes.
IGN:I have a six-year-old daughter. She took my Switch and I don't get to play it anymore. She also has dropped it a lot and it's okay. What have you done with Switch 2 to make sure that it can survive a kid dropping it on the floor or dropping it down the stairs?
Nintendo: Nintendo has made very sturdy devices through the ages and I believe that this time around as well, we've made something that will be sturdy.
Nintendo:Yeah, you can drop it a little bit. I don’t recommend it though!
IGN:I also have a Steam Deck and I like it, but the fan gets very loud when I'm playing high end games. It's almost distracting. What did Nintendo do to make sure that that was taken into account when designing the hardware for Switch 2?
Nintendo:When a fan is loud it really does affect one's gameplay, so that is definitely something we had in the back of our mind during the development of the Nintendo Switch 2. The system is made to adapt depending on the processing capability so I'm kind of curious to hear from the others here what their experience has been like.
Nintendo:When I was playing it it's not like, “Wow, there's a fan in there”. It hasn’t really gotten to the point where, even through development of the hardware, it has bothered me in any way.
Nintendo:The hardware team put quite a lot of effort into making sure the airflow was smooth. So a lot is coming in but there's a lot coming out, and as such the fan noise isn't too significant.
IGN:Nintendo invented the directional pad and it's been important for video games for my entire life. What did your team do to ensure that the Dpad on the Switch 2 was great for fighting games, puzzle games, platformers, all that fun stuff?
Nintendo:You may think that every time you see the directional pad that it's just the same button being reused, but the truth is we do make small adjustments and add small changes every time. I have people – our development and game development teams – try them out when we make a new one.
Nintendo:This is a more detailed point but for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller directional buttons, we made it so that it's even more difficult to have mistaken input. Of course, it doesn't completely eliminate that possibility but it should reduce it.
IGN:I'm a big fan of Nintendo handheld systems and always have been since the original Game Boy. What are each of your personal favorite classic Nintendo handhelds?
Nintendo:I have fond memories for each of the systems that have come out but for me personally, I think the original Game Boy really has a special place in my heart. Part of the reason for that is that since then there's obviously new systems that came out, like the Game Boy Advance for example. But I just distinctly remember my mother with the original Game Boy playing Tetris, and that’s just burned into my memory.
IGN:Some of you worked with the legendary Satoru Iwata. Is there any specific part of his legacy that inspired the Nintendo Switch 2 design?
Nintendo:There are various aspects but what comes to mind first is the magnet connector. We originally didn't adopt it for the Nintendo Switch because it wasn't as secure as we would've liked. However, we put a lot of effort into this aspect and that has come to fruition.
Nintendo:It was Mr. Iwata's concerns about the magnets that meant it didn't come to fruition [for the original Switch]. So being able to actually address all of the issues and create something that probably would've met his standards is moving and meaningful.
IGN:I love it. I think I took the JoyCon on and off 20 times yesterday!
Nintendo:I actually have a question for you. You saw the footage of the JoyCon 2 snapping on and off. Was the impression you got from that footage different from actually snapping it on and off?
IGN:Yes. I thought it was going to be like a refrigerator magnet and it was going to be wobbly loose and instead it just goes ‘snap’ and clicks in. And I was like, “Oh, that feels really nice.”
Nintendo:I'm very relieved to hear that!
IGN:Yeah, they told me I had to stop doing it!
Brian Altano has been playing Mario Kart for 30+ years, and it's crazy that 10 of those years were spent with Mario Kart 8. We haven't seen Battle Mode for Mario Kart World yet, but he's still holding out hope that Block Fort can come back. Bring back Block Fort!"
"One of the biggest barriers to jumping into the current generation for PlayStation players has been the rising cost of living, squeezing wallets so tight that there's sadly been no room for a PS5 in the budget.

In 2025, however, PlayStation has three new ways that get a new PS5 for less: an almost£110-saving Astro Bot Bundle, an added£50 bonus when trading in a PS4, or ahassle-free leasing option with low monthly payments. Scoring a PS5, my friend, is easier than ever right now.
Editor's Note: Brought to you in partnership with PlayStation.
For those almost ready to pull the trigger on buying a PlayStation 5, but have been waiting for a price drop, buying the Astro Bot bundle is the best way to get on board in more ways than one.
The bundle comes in two forms: you can either buy aPS5 Slim (with disc drive) & Astro Bot for £429.99or purchase aDigital Edition PS5 Slim with Astro Bot for £339.99.
Whichever you go for, those prices are £109.99 lower than if you bought each console and the game individually, which you can put towards more games, another DualSense controller, or leave nestled safely in your savings account.
The delightfully beloved platformer that won Game of the Year at the Game Awards 2024,Astro Botis arguably one of the best titles to have bundled with a new console if you haven't had the chance to play it yet.
Since it's a PEGI 7-rated celebration of PlayStation's history & a fun adventure in its own right, it's one of the finest for any gaming household, whether to play yourself or with the children in your family.
Although trading in your PS4 to put towards a PS5 or PS5 Pro has been an option already, PlayStation is offering an extra £50 on top of what you would normally get for your old console, going as high as £150.
AtPlayStation's Trade-In hub page, you can quickly get your PS4 evaluated, ship your console over free of charge, and receive an added £50 voucher along with what you would get for the trade-in as standard.
For example, you could get £100 for a PS4 Pro in good condition and £50 with the trade-up voucher, totalling £150 off a £339.99 PS5 Digital Console & Astro Bot bundle, leaving you with only £189.99 left to pay for your shiny new PlayStation 5 console and added game to get you started.
If you already have a PS5, but your old PS4 has since been going unused and gathering dust, you can still send in your PlayStation 4 in and put your boosted trade-in money towards a PS VR2 headset—so you can jump into exclusive games likeHorizon Call of the Mountainfor a more affordable price.
For you who want to dive into the PS5 ecosystem but don't have the immediate funds to do so, PlayStation Flex is the console-maker's new interesting way to add a PS5 to your home for as low as a mere £10.99 a month.
This is thanks to PlayStation UK's new partnership with Raylo, a top tech leasing service that has been on the service and earning high Trustpilot reviews since 2019.
Through the newPlayStation Flex pagepowered by Raylo, you can effectively set up a rental agreement and have a PS5 Pro, PS5 Slim, or PS5 Digital Edition delivered to your door. Including those consoles, you can also lease a PSVR 2 and some accessories too:
You can choose a 36-, 24-, 12- or rolling monthly lease with payments being lower the longer you sign up for. No matter which way, PlayStation Flex can make for a quick and easy barrier to entry to start your PS5 journey.

"Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition has hit its lowest price yet,now available for $49.99 at Amazon—its best deal to date, even beating Black Friday, according to our records, and even price-tracking siteCamelCamelCamel.

Originally released on October 8 forNintendo SwitchandPlayStation 4 (fully compatible with PS5), this collection brings together the first six mainline Final Fantasy games in their carefully remastered form. Square Enix has opted for refinement rather than reinvention, keeping the original pixelated aesthetic intact but sharpening it for modern displays.
The result is a collection that looks fantastic, whether on a massive TV or in handheld mode. The soundtrack has also received an orchestral upgrade, with legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu overseeing the new arrangements. On top of that, the package introduces a handful of thoughtful quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to disable random encounters and boost experience and gil gains—useful for those who want to focus on the story without the grind.
As a small but nostalgic extra, this edition includes a sticker sheet featuring 12 classic character sprites, including the Black Mage, a Moogle, Terra, Kain, and a mid-cackle Kefka. It’s not the most extravagant of bonuses, but it’s a fun little touch for fans of the series.
At its original $74.99 price, the collection was a tougher sell, but at $49.99, it's a much easier recommendation for anyone interested in the series’ origins. Whether you’re revisiting these classics or playing them for the first time, this is a well-executed remaster of six of themost influential RPGsever made. And with physical copies being the only collectible edition available, it might be worth picking up before they become harder to find, especially at this time.

"Microsoft has created a playable ""interactive space inspired"" byQuake IIusing AI, and it's sparked a vociferous debate online.

As spotted byPC Gamer, thedemois powered by Microsoft'srecently announced Muse and the World and Human Action Model (WHAM) AI system, and ""can dynamically create gameplay visuals and simulate player behavior in real-time,"" which means a semi-playable environment has been generated entirely through AI and without an in-game engine.
""In this real-time tech demo, Copilot dynamically generates gameplay sequences inspired by the classic game Quake II,"" Microsoftexplained. ""Every input you make triggers the next AI-generated moment in the game, almost as if you were playing the original Quake II running on a traditional game engine. Enjoy the experience, share your thoughts, and help shape the future of AI-powered gameplay experiences.
""This bite-sized demo pulls you into an interactive space inspired by Quake II, where AI crafts immersive visuals and responsive action on the fly. It’s a groundbreaking glimpse at a brand new way of interacting with games, turning cutting-edge research into a quick and compelling playable demo.""
All thatsoundspretty impressive, but the demo itself is... well, less so.
After The Game Awards boss Geoff Keighley shared a brief video of the demo in actionon X / Twitter,hundreds of people responded, with few having anything positive to say.
Microsoft has created an AI-generated replica of Quake II that you can play in browser.""Every frame is created on the fly by an AI world model.""Play it here:https://t.co/WGQymDOmsjpic.twitter.com/35MX5aHPbF
""Man, I don't want the future of games to be AI-generated slop,"" said oneRedditor. ""There will be a point where it will be easier to use AI, and then all the greedy studios will do it exclusively. The human element will be removed.
""And the worst part is gamers will buy it. They buy skins for 100 dollars. They will buy whatever you sell them.""
""Microsoft's boast that they want 'to build a whole catalog of games that use this new AI model,' despite it not being clear if the current technique will ever even be capable of letting you turn around without moving to a random point on the map let alone come up with an original game, really typifies what's wrong with AI and the tech industry,""addedanother.
""I had a better experience literally just imagining the game in my head,""saidanother commenter.
Not everyone was so quick to dismiss it, however.
""I don't know why everything has to be doom and gloom,""saida more cheery respondent. ""It's a demo for a reason. It shows the future possibilities. Having an AI that is able to create a coherent and consistent world is crazy. But this cannot be used to create a full game or anything enjoyable. You cannot play this. Seems like a tool for early concept/pitching phase. This can also bring improvement in other fields in AI as what it is doing is impressive.
""This is not even a product yet but a demo showing how much they've improved from just a few months ago.""
Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney had a rather different response:

Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI.The game failed, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”
Still, that hasn’t put off a number of video game companies from using generative AI in the development of their products.Activision recently disclosed the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assetsas part of new requirements on Steam, amid a backlash to an ""AI slop"" zombie Santa loading screen.
And last month,Horizon actor Ashly Burch addressed a controversial AI Aloy video that leaked online, using it to call attention to the demands of striking voice actors.

"Nintendo’s first post-Switch 2 Nintendo Direct Treehouse livestream is being flooded with angry comments from users calling on the company to ""DROP THE PRICE.""

A cursory glance at the YouTube chat for the stream shows a flood of complaints about the pricing of Nintendo’s move to the next-generation, which includes the $449.99 Switch 2 and, perhaps most controversially,the jump to $79.99 for Mario Kart World.
Whilethe Nintendo Switch 2 system itself will retail for $449.99, a bundle is also available with Mario Kart Worldincluded for $499.99, saving $30 on the price of the game.
But Mario Kart World isn’t the only Nintendo Switch 2 game to cost $79.99.Some Nintendo Switch 2 Edition titles, such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, also cost $79.99.
Nintendo has even come under firefor charging for the Switch 2 tutorial video game experience, Welcome Tour, which fans have said should be a free pack-in.Astro's Playroom, for example, comes pre-installed on every PlayStation 5 console, serving additionally as a free tech demo for the DualSense controller.

The shock at Nintendo’s pricing is now spilling over into the Treehouse livestream, although the presenters have so far, perhaps understandably, ignored the chat. It seems likely that Nintendo will face this sort of thing from the video game community from now on, piling the pressure on the company to address the complaints.
For more context, be sure to check out IGN’s article revealingwhat the experts have to say about Nintendo’s Switch 2 and Mario Kart World pricing.
And, in case you missed out, check outall the news announced during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.

"It looks like Nintendo Korea's website briefly gave away what sidekick may be joining Kong in the upcomingDonkey Kong Bananza.

Though the image was quickly switched out with a less revealing one, it wasn't quite quick enough forResetEra, which managed to grab a screenshot before the website was changed.
Warning!Potential Donkey Kong: Bananza spoilers follow:
In most key art associated with the game, we see Kong smashing a fist into the ground, throwing up a shower of rocks and rubble, with the purple, rock-like Odd Rock behind him. The image on the Korean website essentially showed the same, but with one key difference: Odd Rock is missing, and a young Pauline is holding on for dear life to Kong's necktie.
This is the first time Pauline's been acknowledged in any of the images, teaser trailers, or hands-on previews shown thus far, suggesting Nintendo was perhaps hoping to keep her appearance a surprise. Whoops!
More intriguingly still, Pauline's young age suggests Donkey Kong Bananza could be a prequel of some sort — although again, Nintendo's tight-lipped on that for now.
""I think Bananza is on track to be one of the most gorgeous Nintendo games I’ve seen,"" we wrote in ourDonkey Kong Bananza first hands-on preview. ""It really does take advantage of Switch 2's hardware — the environments are beautiful and DK’s animations are wonderfully expressive, and I left feeling like the next generation of first-party Nintendo games had truly arrived.""
Now that we finally have arelease dateandtech specson the highly anticipated Switch successor, Nintendo Switch 2 — as well as an idea ofhow much first-party Nintendo games may cost on the new system—check out our deep dive into all the facts as we talk to industry experts.
For more on Nintendo Switch 2, you can catch up oneverything shown at last week's Nintendo Direct. Donkey Kong Bananza comes out July 17 for $69.99, exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.

"TheNintendo Switch 2has finally been revealed, and while it brings huge improvements over the original console, it doesn’t exist in the same vacuum that the original handheld did. With the introduction of devices like theSteam DeckandAsus ROG Ally X, a ton of handheld gaming systems out there can play AAA PC games on the go.

So, while the Switch 2 will automatically have a niche carved out for being a system that plays, well, Nintendo games likeMario Kart World,anyone that’s buying a Switch 2 to play multiplatform games will have to reckon with devices like the Steam Deck – especially with the Switch 2’s $449 price tag.
Now that Nintendo has given a sneak peek into the hardware that’s running its new console, we can take a look at how exactly it will run, and whether or not its 4K promises are more than empty words.
The SoC (System on a Chip) that runs the Nintendo Switch 2 is probably the most important part of the console, but it’s the thing we know the least about. We do know that it’s a “custom Nvidia processor” thatsupports DLSS and ray tracing, but beyond that, neither Nintendo nor Nvidia have revealed any specifics. Luckily, there are a ton of leaks that suggest the Nintendo Switch 2 is using the aging Ampere graphics architecture behind theRTX 3080.
Going all the way back to 2023, there wereleaks suggesting that the Nintendo Switch 2 would be using the Nvidia Tegra T239 SoC. This APU uses 8 ARM A78C cores, combined with an Nvidia Ampere GPU with 1,536 CUDA cores. Napkin math puts that at 12 Streaming Multiprocessors, which would be significantly smaller than even the smallest Ampere GPU – the RTX 3050 for laptops. However, assuming Nvidia didn’t nerf the Ampere SMs in the T239, each SM would have four Tensor Cores and an RT core, making for a total of 48 and 12, respectively.
To be fair, the Steam Deck is using a custom AMD APU that’s built on 8 AMD RDNA 2 GPU cores, which is smaller than what Nintendo is offering here. But, you have to keep in mind that the Steam Deck has a lower resolution display, and pumps more power into it. Plus,AMD Z2 processorsare coming out over the next year, with the Z2 Extreme featuring 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, which will be a huge upgrade. Though, systems with that chipset are going to bemuchmore expensive than the Switch 2.
That small of a GPU basically makes 4K gaming an impossibility natively, but because the Tensor Cores are there, DLSS is going to be a major factor in how the Nintendo Switch performs when docked – assuming this is the SoC that’s actually in the system. However, with so few Tensor Cores, even upscaling to 4K is going to be a stretch in everything but the most lightweight games.
Instead, most games are likely going to target 1080p, even if they don’t natively render at that resolution. There are games like Donkey Kong Bananza that do seem to be rendering at a native 1080p resolution, according toDigital Foundry’s hands-on demos. However, third-party games like Cyberpunk 2077 seem to be relying heavily on upscaling, with native resolutions as low as 540p. I wouldn’t expect the Nintendo Switch 2 to ever be able to handle Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K, even with DLSS, though Nintendo will definitely have better luck with any game it can get running natively at 1080p.
The Ampere cores in the rumored T239 also have RT cores, which should theoretically allow for ray tracing in Nintendo Switch 2 games. Though, again, this will be heavily constrained by the processor’s 12 RT cores. Ray tracing will be possible, but don’t expect any jaw-dropping implementations of the technology, and especially don’t expect it in games likeCyberpunk 2077.
Even with RT cores, ray tracing is an extremely expensive workload for the GPU, and the T239 is limited by more than just its small SM count – power is a huge limiting factor, too. I spoke withRichard Leadbetter over at Digital Foundry, who told me that the entire system likely consumes as little as 10W, including the display, the SoC, and the mainboard. We won’t know exactly what the T239’s actual TDP (thermal design power) is until someone finds a way to measure it, but it likely leaves only 5-6W for the SoC itself – a third of the power of the Steam Deck’s AMD APU.
However, while the Nintendo Switch 2 might not be able to produce the same amount of power as ahandheld gaming PClike the Asus ROG Ally X, that doesn’t mean there won’t be gorgeous games running on the system. After all, games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza look stunning, and it goes to show how clever Nintendo developers are at getting the most out of the hardware in the Switch.
After all, the original Nintendo Switch was powered by the Nvidia Tegra X1, which was built on thenow-ancient Maxwell graphics architectureand only packed 256 CUDA cores. Ampere is orders of magnitude more efficient than Maxwell even on its best days, and there are six times more cores in the Switch 2’s GPU. The Nintendo Switch 2 should bewayfaster than the original console, which bodes well for cross-generation ports like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
While a total system power budget of 10W means the system isn’t quite as fast as it could be, it does mean the battery will have a much better time keeping up. Nintendo has come out and said it should last around 2 hours at a minimum. That’s less than was quoted for the original Switch, but that shouldn’t be too surprising, due to its higher-resolution display and more powerful processor.
The Nintendo Switch 2 has a 5,220mAh battery, a large step up from the 4,310mAh battery in the original console. That’s a sizable jump, and if its battery has the same voltage of the original Switch, that would equate to around 19Whr. That’s a smaller battery than theSteam Deck, which is probably why Nintendo quotes a similar battery life to the Steam Deck, despite its less power-hungry processor.
Nintendo probably could have put a more powerful battery in the Switch 2, but its decision likely came down to size constraints. There’s only so much battery that’ll fit while retaining the same thickness as the original Nintendo Switch, after all.
The most striking difference at first glancebetween the Switch and Switch 2is probably going to be the display. While it doesn’t have the OLED screen that made theSwitch OLEDsuch a marvel, the display is bigger and has a higher resolution. The Nintendo Switch 2 sports a 7.9-inch LCD display with a resolution of 1920x1080 with HDR 10 support. The display is also fast, supporting variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. That’s honestly a bit overkill considering the silicon powering the thing, but it does mean that older games or indie titles will feel extremely smooth – assuming they have unlocked frame rates. 120Hz is also a useful refresh rate for games that target 40fps since that makes for a clean ratio that won’t result in excessive stuttering.
Nintendo hasn’t released any information about the brightness of the display, but the HDR 10 certification means it needs toat leasthave a peak brightness of 1,000 nits, so it’s going to be a bright screen. We don’t know exactly how color performance will turn out either, but Nintendo does claim that it supports WCG, or Wide Color Gamut.
The display is probably going to be the thing that lifts the Nintendo Switch 2 above its competitors. The Steam Deck LCD has an 800p display with a peak brightness of 400 nits, and it doesn’t support WCG. The Steam Deck OLED does offer a much nicer display, but it’s still an 800p display. The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is also a huge upgrade over the original, which had a 6.2-inch, 720p LCD display.
In a vacuum, the Nintendo Switch 2 is massively better than the original Nintendo Switch. It’s leagues faster, has a screen that’s bigger, brighter and sharper, and has Joy-Con that you don’t have to wrestle with to disconnect. The only problem is that the Switch doesn’t exist in a vacuum anymore.
There are a ton of handheld gaming systems out there now, and while most of them are more expensive than the $449 Nintendo Switch 2, they likely offer a better gameplay experience in multi-platform games. The real appeal of the Switch 2 is going to be Nintendo’s catalog of first-party games, just like with the original console. Nintendo is known for making great games that make the most of its – relatively – weak hardware. If you’re the type of gamer that falls in love with Nintendo games, then the Nintendo Switch 2 makes a lot of sense. However, if you’re just going to get this thing to play Cyberpunk or Elden Ring on the train, there arebetter gaming handheld optionsout there.

"I’ve got a stack of opened booster packs and zero regrets. That’s how I know this deal is worth flagging.Pokémon TCG: Scarlet & Violet Surging Sparks Booster Bundleis finally back at Amazon, and it’sactuallyselling at retail again; $45.02 for six packs. In 2025, findingPokémon cards at their intended pricefeels like spotting a shiny on the first encounter. It’s rare. It’s thrilling. And honestly, I want more.

This bundle includes six booster packs from the latest Surging Sparks expansion. If you’re into Electric-types or just want an excuse to hear foil crackle between your fingers, I think this is it. The new card art looks great, there are some intriguing new Trainer strategies in the mix, and opening packs still hits the same dopamine receptors it did in 1999.
Surging Sparks has some unreal chase cards, making a massive shift in art quallity in the Scarlet and Violet era. The Special Illustration Rare Pikachu ex is going for around $430, and Latias ex is even higher at nearly $500. Milotic ex is another banger at about $150 thanks to an ability that blocks damage from Tera Pokémon. Hydreigon ex is strong too, with a deck-discarding attack that’s super viable for play. Even the Hyper Rare Pikachu ex holds value at around $120. I don’t expect to pull any of these, but the odds keep things interesting.
In my opinion, this is the kind of deal that’s perfect for casual collectors like me, or anyone who enjoys the chaos of pulling something rare right after saying, “Just one more pack.” I know better than to promise a Pikachu EX SIR in every box, but I’ll absolutely take my chances when I don’t have to pay a third-party markup for the privilege.
""Surging Sparksis packed with over 250 new cards, including special illustration rares you'll want to display and hyper rares that could redefine your collection. These aren't just cards; they're instant eye-catchers that bring a tropical vibe to the table.""
""Every booster pack feels like a potential game-changer with pulls like the terrastallized Pikachu EX and the stunning Latias EX & Latios Full Art. Surging Sparks is about delivering the goods, whether you're in it for the strategic edge or hunting down those high-value collectibles. It's got style, substance, and a buzz that's hard to ignore.""
If you’re building a deck, feeding a binder addiction, or just gifting this to a kid so you can secretly open the packs yourself later, this is your chance. No inflated prices. No shady listings. Just six legit booster packs that actually ship from Amazon.
I already added one to my cart. I’m pretending it’s “for research.” You can decide your own excuse.

"The GOG Preservation Program is growing with a solid list of inductees, including classic titles like Silent Hill 4: The Room, Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption, Fallout 2, Deus Ex, and more.

The PC digital storefrontdetailedhow it planned to expand its retro-gaming-focused service yesterday, providing fans with a lineup of games it has committed to support for the foreseeable future. It’s a list of 26 titles thatGOG sayswill “remain playable in their best versions” that players can safely assume they’ll have access to for years to come.
Silent Hill 4: The Room is one title that will benefit from the GOG Preservation Program in more ways than one. In addition to securing its future, GOG says the entry’s status with the service means it comes with “missing content that was never available on PC before.” This includes the reintroduction of Hauntings, which spruce up that iconic Silent Hill atmosphere with spooky effects, such as flickering lamps and possessed telephones. Modern controller support has also been added.
F.E.A.R. Platinum, which waspromised last month, arrives as an especially nice addition, too, as its original developer, Monolith Productions, wasshuttered by Warner Bros. last month. As more studio closures occur and the industry leans toward a digital future, it’s a perfect example of what GOG aims to accomplish with the Preservation Program.
You can see the March 2025 additions to the GOG Preservation Program, along with discounts as part of the currentSpring Sale, below.
The GOG Preservation Program is a relatively new initiative from the CD Projekt Red-owned storefront that serves as the company’s commitment to keep a selection of games up-to-date and available for PC players. More than 100 games are supported through the program, and judging by today’s announcement, the list will only continue to grow.
""The GOG Preservation Program is our commitment to preserving gaming history,"" GOGsaid at the time of its reveal late last year. ""Through the program, players can trust that their games will always be up to date and ready to run on current and future PC setups.
""Whether it’s manuals, DLCs, or missing features, we’re offering the most complete version possible, backed by GOG’s tech support and offline installers, so you can safeguard these classics for years to come.""

"Samsung came in strong with today’s deals, and I have to admit, I’m eyeing a couple of them up.The 49-inch Odyssey G9 gaming monitorlooks like something pulled straight from a sci-fi movie.The Galaxy Tab S10+ 5Gis basically a laptop in disguise, and theGalaxy Z Flip 6is making flip phones cool again. If that’s not enough, theS24 Ultrais here to remind every other smartphone who’s boss, and theSSD dealsare giving me a solid excuse to finally clean up my storage situation.

Some of these discounts are impressive, like$500 off that insane QD-OLED monitor. Others, like theSonic statueandRimWorld deal, are more like little bonus treats for the fans. Either way, if you’ve been waiting for a solid sale on a gaming monitor, a high-end phone, or a storage upgrade, Samsung has something worth looking at today.
AliExpress has brand new PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch OLED consoles on sale for prices you won't find anywhere else. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming console that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by youraccount, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item.
I want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.
This phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.
I didn’t know I needed an 11-inch Sonic statue until now. The detail is impressive, the LED lights make it pop, and it’s half off. If you’re a Sonic fan, this is an easy yes. If you’re not, well, now’s a great time to start.
I can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.
RimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.
This SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.
I never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.
I think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience.

At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call.

An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.
This isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist.

For those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says ""powerful Pokémon"" like an angry robot penguin).

You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive.

Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).
If you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, ""I really need to delete some games,"" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.

"Nintendo just revealed so much about the Nintendo Switch 2 during its latest Direct, but we have learned even more since the hour-long presentation ended, including the new console's tech specs. While we still have a lot of questions, let's break down what's new with the Switch 2.

This had been touched on before, butNintendo reiteratedthat this new system will feature a 7.9-inch wide color gamut LCD screen that is capable of outputting at 1080p (1920x1080). This is a big upgrade from Switch 1's 6.2-inch screen, the Switch OLED's 7-inch screen (although we will miss OLED!), and the Switch Lite's 5.5-inch screen.
There is also support for HDR10 and VRR up to 120 Hz, which means games can jump up to 120fps if they and your setup allow it.
It was also confirmed that slotting the Switch 2 to its new dock will allow games to be played in 4K (3840x2160) at 60fps or 1080p/1440p (1920x1080/2560x1440) at 120fps. We know these higher-end graphics are made possible by a ""custom processor made by NVIDIA,"" but sadly we are currently given no further details in regard to Switch 2's CPU/GPU.
What was revealed, however, was the battery life. The Switch 2's internal battery is a Lithium-ion battery with 5220mAh, and this will allow for approximately 2 - 6.5 hours of battery life and a charge time of three hours when in Sleep mode. Nintendo noted these are ""rough estimates"" and that the ""battery life will depend on the games you play.""
This battery life is just about the same as the launch model Switch 1 as it boasted a range of 2.5 - 6.5 hours. On the other hand, the Switch 2's battery life is a downgrade from the three newer Switch models - Nintendo Switch (4.5 - 9 hours), Nintendo Switch - OLED Model (4.5 - 9 hours), and Nintendo Switch Lite (3 - 7 hours).
Elsewhere, we learn that the Switch is approximately 4.5 inches tall x 10.7 inches wide x .55 inches thick with the Joy-Con 2 attached. This translates to a weight of roughly .88 pounds without Joy-Con 2 and 1.18 lbs with them attached.
The weight of the Switch 2 is an exact match for the current Switch 1 model, but it is both taller and longer than any current model with Joy-Con attached;
Speaking of Joy-Con, we sadly don't get the confirmation that they are using Hall Effect joysticks that would likely preventthe drifting issues many Switch owners experienced.They very well may use them, asit was hinted at in a patent from 2023,but we'll have to wait to find out for sure.
On the audio front, the Switch 2 supports linear PCM output 5.1ch. If you want a surround sound effect, that can also be enabled via headphones of the built-in speaker after a system update.
For storage, the Switch 2 will feature 256 GB of internal storage, which is another upgrade from the 32 GB available on the Switch and Switch Lite and the 64 GB on the Switch - OLED Model. Another big difference here is that the Switch 2 will require microSD Express cards for up to 2TB of extra storage, meaning the microSDXC cards the current Switch models support will not be able to be transferred over to the new console.
To wrap up, it was also revealed the Switch 2 will support Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi 6), it will have 2 USB-C ports, a 3.5mm 4-contact stereo mini-plug (CTIA standard), and a built-in monaural microphone with noice cancellation, echo cancellation, and auto gain control.

"As Nintendo had teased, Nvidia has now discussed the custom GPU powering the Nintendo Switch 2, although it failed to go into the level of detail tech enthusiasts were hoping for.

In ablog post, Nvidia confirmed what IGN had reported earlier today from Nintendo itself: that its GPU enables AI upscaling via DLSS and ray tracing.
Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is an AI-powered technology that uses machine learning to upscale lower-resolution images in real-time, enhancing both performance and image quality in games.
There is a little more detail on offer here on the Switch 2’s GPU. Nvidia described it as a “custom Nvidia processor featuring an Nvidia GPU with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements.”
Nvidia continued: “With 1,000 engineer-years of effort across every element — from system and chip design to a custom GPU, APIs and world-class development tools — the Nintendo Switch 2 brings major upgrades.”
Those upgrades include up to 4K gaming in TV mode and up to 120 FPS at 1080p in handheld mode. Nintendo Switch 2 also supports HDR, and AI upscaling “to sharpen visuals and smooth gameplay.”
The new RT Cores bring real-time ray tracing, delivering “lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows for more immersive worlds,” Nvidia continued.
Tensor Cores, meanwhile, power AI-driven features like DLSS, “boosting resolution for sharper details without sacrificing image quality.”
Interestingly, Nvidia said the Tensor Cores also enable AI-powered face tracking and background removal in video chat use cases, “enhancing social gaming and streaming.”
During the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed the C button, which is used for new chat functionality that incorporates an external camera and the microphone in the Switch 2 itself. Nintendo made a point of saying the tech is smart enough to pay attention to the player’s voice and filter out background noise.
And here’s the big claim from Nvidia:
“With 10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2 delivers smoother gameplay and sharper visuals.”
There’s no detail on how it’s determined that graphics performance. It will no doubt be left to experts such asDigital Foundryto run the numbers once the Switch 2 launches in June.
Elsewhere, Nvidia said the Tensor Cores “boost AI-powered graphics while keeping power consumption efficient,” and the RT Cores “enhance in-game realism with dynamic lighting and natural reflections.”
Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) via Nvidia G-SYNC in handheld mode “ensures ultra-smooth, tear-free gameplay.”
In a hardware-focused roundtable Q&A in New York yesterday, attended by IGN,Nintendo representatives confirmed the Switch 2 uses DLSS, but did not specify which version of the tech, or whether it had been customized for Switch 2. It was a similarly vague response when Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2’s GPU is capable of ray tracing.
And what about the GPU itself? Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, chimed in to say Nintendo prefers not to get in the weeds on things like the GPU.
“Nintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec,” he said. “What we really like to focus on is the value that we can provide to our consumers. But I do believe that our partner Nvidia will be sharing some information.”
In January, the internet spotted a patent, filed July 2023 but published for the first time earlier this year,that described AI image upscaling technologythat would help keep video game download sizes small enough to fit on a physical game cartridge while offering up to 4K textures.

"I didn’t think we’d see a proper Pokémon TCG restock this early in 2025. Honestly, I was betting on summer at best, but here we are with actual product showing up on Amazon and not behind some sketchy paywalled Discord server. While the internet’s currently losing its mind over Prismatic Evolutions and burning money chasing stock alerts for Rival Destinies, the smart play is scooping up the older sets that just hit Amazon Global. We’re talking Scarlet and Violet era stuff, Sword and Shield throwbacks, and boxes that were basically extinct six months ago.

This is the kind of flood the TCG community needed. Not just for collectors trying to complete sets, but for anyone who’s tired of battling bots for ETBs like it’s the Hunger Games. There’s a real mix available right now: Booster Bundles, Premium Collections, tins with actual storage value. And yes, even a few deals that make it feel like Amazon’s trying to keep the vibe positive. If you’re chasing big pulls like Greninja SIR or Pikachu ex SIR, or just need to stock up on sleeves and dice, this is the best stock refreshes we’ve seen in a while.
AliExpress is currently offering theSony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphonesfor only $225.18 after coupon code:IFP7FJZis applied during checkout. This product is stocked in a US warehouse, so it ships free and arrives within about a week. This is an import model with a warranty that won't be honored in the United States. AliExpress makes up for it with a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days.
In our glowingSony WH1000XM5 review, Kevin Lee wrote that ""The Sony WH-1000XM5 is hands down the best sounding and most impressive noise-canceling headphones around. They demand a high premium but the cost of audio excellence is well worth it with this pair of headphones.""
The real deal here is the fact that theTwilight MasqueradeElite Trainer Box is actually in stock. Seeing it available without a 200% markup or sketchy third-party seller feels borderline miraculous. You’re getting nine booster packs, a full-art Teal Mask Ogerpon promo, and all the usual ETB goodies like energy cards, condition markers, and themed sleeves.
It’s not every day you seeBrilliant StarsBuild and Battle Boxes in stock, let alone without having to navigate the wild west of resale sites. At $63.34, this one comes with four booster packs and a pre-release promo card, which makes it a solid pickup for collectors looking to flesh out their Sword and Shield era sets. Arceus VSTAR headlines the expansion, and the pull potential here still holds up.
Among Us 4-Pack on Steam is a sneaky little deal that gives you four copies of the game for the price of one, making it dangerously easy to rope your friends into a night of trust issues and vent-related betrayal. It supports cross-platform play, customizable settings, and chaotic emergency meetings that usually end with the wrong person getting ejected. If you’ve somehow missed the social deduction chaos, now’s the perfect time to catch up and take three crewmates down with you.
TheHisuian Electrode V Boxis back in stock at Amazon for $42.45, which is a win considering how sporadically these pop up. It's one of those V boxes that slipped under the radar when it first launched, but now that Sword and Shield-era product is drying up it’s worth grabbing. You get a foil Hisuian Electrode V promo, a regular Electrode foil, an oversized version (because why not), and four booster packs to rip through.
This limited-edition snack box is a flavor-packed tribute toAssassin’s Creed Shadows, blending premium Japanese treats with collectible game merch in a way that feels like an edible side quest. You get 15 unique snacks, a full bag of exclusive Kit Kats, a custom Tenugui towel, and even an in-game item called The Hourglass that’s only available through this box. With artwork prints, a detailed snack guide, and a box sleeve that transforms into a display-worthy poster, it’s more than just snacks.
Seeing theShining FatesPikachu V Box on Amazon again feels like spotting a shiny in the wild. At $49.96 it’s not exactly a steal, but having it in stock is the real value. This box comes with a foil Pikachu V promo, an oversized version for flair, and four Shining Fates booster packs. That means a legit shot at pulls from one of the most hype-filled sets of the Sword and Shield era.
TheSurging SparksBooster Bundle is actually in stock at Amazon for $47.95, which is kind of a miracle considering how fast this set’s been disappearing. You get six booster packs from the newest Scarlet and Violet expansion, which includes some major chase cards like Pikachu ex SIR and Latias ex. If you missed the chaos of launch day or couldn’t snag a bundle without battling bots, this is your chance to catch up.
I want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.
This phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.
I can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.
RimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.
This SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.
I never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.
I think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.
The games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art. The remastered soundtracks, modernized UI, and quality-of-life improvements bring these classics into the modern age while keeping their original charm intact. Each game features iconic character designs by Kazuko Shibuya and a faithful soundtrack rearranged by Nobuo Uematsu. Whether you’re reliving the golden age of RPGs or playing them for the first time, this bundle is the ultimate way to experience Final Fantasy’s roots. The limited-time sale price of $52.49, down from $74.99, makes this an easy win for any RPG fan.

A genuine Apple leather case for $11.99? That’s not a typo. It’s an 80% discount. Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.
If you’re tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.
Why buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.
If you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.
Still using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.
These aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.
These Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.
Luxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.
This isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.
For those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says ""powerful Pokémon"" like an angry robot penguin).
I'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.
If somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.
Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).
If you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, ""I really need to delete some games,"" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.
Samsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room. The Acoustic Lens Subwoofer ensures deep, punchy bass, while Adaptive Sound and Game Mode Pro make sure everything from dialogue to explosions sounds crisp. At $764 off, this is the cheapest we’ve seen it outside of Black Friday.
LG B4 OLED TVbrings incredible picture quality at a price that doesn’t require selling a kidney. It features Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, an α8 AI Processor that automatically enhances whatever you’re watching, and LG’s latest webOS for easy access to streaming apps and over 300 free LG Channels. Gamers get Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and VRR, plus four HDMI 2.1 ports. At $499.99, this is one of the best deals for an OLED right now.
Samsung’s S90D OLED TVis a beast, packing AI-powered 4K upscaling, Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for silky smooth gameplay, and Dolby Atmos for immersive sound. Real Depth Enhancer makes everything look more lifelike, and PANTONE validation ensures accurate color reproduction. At $300 off, this is a great price for a high-end 65” OLED TV.
Sony’s WH-CH520 headphonesoffer 50 hours of battery life, customizable sound settings, and a lightweight, comfortable design. Multipoint connection makes switching between devices seamless, and DSEE upscaling improves compressed audio. At just $35.95, these are one of the best budget wireless headphones out there today.
Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 bring top-tier noise cancellation, a Tensor A1 chip for AI-powered audio enhancements, and large 11mm drivers for rich bass. Conversation Detection automatically switches to transparency mode when you talk, so you don’t have to take them out. If you need premium wireless earbuds, this is asolid deal for these 9/10 buds.
Enshrouded is a survival RPG with deep crafting, intense combat, and massive co-op potential. Play solo or team up with up to 16 friends, build custom bases, and fight through a dark, mysterious world. It’s still in early access, but at $23.99, it’s worth jumping in now aswe gave it 8/10.

"Bloodborneturns 10 years old today, and fans are celebrating by organizing yet another return to Yharnam community event.

FromSoftware’s PlayStation 4 masterpiece launched on March 24, 2015, and helped cement the Japanese developer as one of the greatest of our time. Critical and commercial acclaim followed, and a follow-up in the vein of the Dark Souls sequels seemed inevitable.
But since then… nothing. Why hasn’t Sony followed upBloodbornewith either a current-gen remaster, a full-on sequel, or at the very least a next-gen update that would finally make it officially playable in 60fps? Fans have begged Sony for more Bloodborne ever since it came out. The deafening silence in response remains one of the most puzzling business decisions in all video games.
Earlier this year, we got an explanation of sorts. Following his exit from Sony,PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida revealed his Bloodborne no-show theory. To be clear up front: this is Yoshida’s opinion, which inan interview with Kinda Funny Gameshe stressed was not inside information, or the reveal of the current deliberations within the bowels of Sony itself.
“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida said. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.
“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”
Miyazaki-san is of course Hidetaka Miyazaki, the boss of FromSoftware. And yes, he’s incredibly successful. Not only for the influential Dark Souls series, but, most recently, the mainstream hitElden Ring, which propelled FromSoftware to new heights. So much so thatit’s getting a multiplayer spin-off this year.
And it seems obvious to say Miyazaki will be incredibly busy with multiple projects to direct and a company to run. After Bloodborne came out in 2015, Miyazaki directedDark Souls 3, then 2019’sSekiro: Shadows Die Twicefor Activision, then the aforementioned Elden Ring for Bandai Namco. What's next? Miyazaki has yet to say.
In interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year,Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware.
In the years since, modders have tried to fill the gaps with fan-made projects that improve upon the base PS4 Bloodborne experience. But Sony has taken a dim view.Well-known Bloodborne 60fps mod creator Lance McDonald announced in Januarythat he’d received a takedown notification on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment “asking that I remove links to the patch I posted on the internet, so I've now done so.” The DMCA takedown arrived four years after the mod was released.
Then, just a week later, Lilith Walther,creator ofNightmare Kart, which was previously known asBloodborne Kart, and the eye-catching Bloodborne PSX demake, tweeted to say an old YouTube video of the demake was hit with a copyright claim.
Recently, fans managed to get PS4 emulators to deliver something akin to a remaster on PC. The tech experts atDigital Foundry released a videocovering “a breakthrough in PS4 emulation” via ShadPS4, which means Bloodborne is now fully playable start to finish in 60fps. Could this breakthrough have triggered an aggressive response from Sony? IGN asked Sony for comment at the time, but it has yet to respond.
That’s all we have to go on, really, which leaves Bloodborne fans to take it upon themselves to organize Return to Yharnam community events.Another kicks off today, on Bloodborne’s 10th anniversary, and calls on fans to create a new character, and summon as many random cooperators and invaders as possible, and leave in-game messages flagging they’re a part of this latest community drive.
Perhaps this will be all that’s left for fans to do in the world of Bloodborne forever more.

"Final Fantasy VII Rebirthis now available at its lowest price so far.Woot is offering the game for $32.99for PS5, a significant drop from its regular price of $69.99. For those who have been waiting to pick it up, this is a great opportunity to do so at a significant discount, and potentially one of the best deals of the year.

It's hard to imagine the game dropping any further in price anytime soon, making this likely the best opportunity to buy it at the lowest price possible in 2025. With such a steep discount, I wouldn't be surprising if it sells out quickly, so if you're interested in picking it up, don't wait too long.
In our 9/10 review, Michael Higham called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth“a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth,” and “an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long.” While it takes some creative liberties in reimagining the classic, he described it as “thrilling and unexpectedly impactful.”
Woot, an Amazon-owned online retailer, is known for offering limited-time deals on video games, tech, and more. It's a trusted source for deep discounts, and one we frequently recommend on IGN for finding some of the best gaming bargains around.

"Several of thenew 2025 Samsung TVsthat were showcased earlier this year atCESare now available for purchase at Samsung's official online store. Select Samsung Neo QLED and OLED TVs are currently in stock and they ship out immediately for as early as April 9-10 delivery. Alternatively, you can pick up select models at your local Best Buy. Not every TV has been released yet, but I expect more models to become available soon.

Samsung showcased several of their top models duringCES 2025. Here's a quick rundown of the biggest highlights. At the moment, exact pricing for each model is unknown.
Samsung revealed a total of six Mini-LED TV models for 2025, and three of the models are available for purchase starting today. The Neo QLED QN990F andQN900Fare true 8K TVs with some incremental improvements like the new anti-glare tech, the One Connect wireless transmitter box, and access to Samsung's Art Store, which was previously retricted to the Frame TVs. The Neo QLEDQN90F, QN85F,QN80Fand QN70F are the new 4K Mini-LED models. The highest end model is the QN90F and it will feature the same 165Hz refresh rate, Gen 3 processor, and anti-glare coating as the S95F. The mid-range QN85F will be Samsung's first 100"" TV.
The new OLED TVs - the S95F, S90F, and S85F - feature several incremental upgrades over its predecessors. The S95F, Samsung's flagship model, boasts a new NQ4 AI Gen 3 processor, a faster 165Hz refresh rate, an improved anti-glare coating, and an upgraded QD OLED panel that promises up to 2,000 nits of brightness. The S90F will also feature the Gen 3 processor, 144Hz refresh rate with VRR, and a QD OLED panel with up to 1,300nits of brightness (for TV models 55"" and up). TheS85Fremains the ""budget"" OLED TV with a Gen 2 processor and is the only model that's available now.
Not yet released
The Frame Pro will make its debut this year alongside the standard Frame TV. The Frame Pro finally features the superior Neo QLED Mini-LED panel for richer and brighter colors, a faster 144Hz refresh rate, the new anti-glare tech, and wireless hookups in the form of a ""One Connect"" box that can be stowed away discreetly. The standard The Frame TV will still be available too, at a significantly lower cost I assume.
Samsung QN90D (2024) Reviewby Jaron Schneider
Samsung’s 2024 mini LED QN90D is a very nice television that refines the interface and adds a host of new features that increase the value of the offering. It’s expensive, but the brightness, color quality, wealth of HDMI 2.1 ports, built-in gaming, and more make a solid argument to warrant the asking price.
Like just about everyone else in the industry, Samsung is going all in on AI. Samsung's new tech for 2025 is their ""Vision AI"", which can recognize the content you're watching, including specifics like the actors or setting, and display relevant personalized commentary in real-time. In addition, more TV models this year will be equipped with AI Upscaling Pro and AI Motion Enhancer Pro which work in tandem to optimize image quality on the fly. Other features include Active Voice Amplier Pro, which uses AI to isolate and enhance voices, AI Optimization, and AI Energy Mode.
Samsung is also decisively moving many of their TV panels to the matte-like anti-glare coating we saw on the S95D in 2024. This anti-glare anti-reflective tech doesn't desaturate like we typically see with anti-glare coatings from other brands, and yet reflections are minimized to the point that you'll never notice them..

"As part of its Spring Sale, SteelSeries is taking 35% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets. The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Destiny 2 in-game items.

The SteelSeries Nova 7 is the latest successor to the highly rated Arctis 7 series of headsets. It's every bit as good as its predecessor but with some welcome upgrades like a USB Type-C charging port, a longer battery life (38 hours vs. 30 hours), simultaneous wireless and Bluetooth connectivity, and multi-platform compatibility. PC gamers also have access to the SteelSeries GG app, which opens up a whole suite of customization for your audio. If that's too much for you, there are presets for specific games that are actually tailormade by the game developers. For PS5 gamers, the Nova 7 is also compatible with the PlayStation 5's Tempest 3D Audio.
The Arctis Nova 7 is one of thebest headsetsyou can get forPS5and PC. In hisNova 7 review, Matthew Adler wrote that ""SteelSeries continues to push the boundaries of what a headset is capable of. With the addition of simultaneous Bluetooth audio, you can enjoy music, podcasts, or just chat with your friends without losing your game audio – all with a single pair of headphones. The Arctis Nova 7’s new design is sleek, lightweight, and still remains one of the most comfortable headsets I’ve ever used."" I own a pair of these myself and highly recommend it.

"USB Type-C has become the standard for charging and data cables alike, so it's good to have extra on hand. Here's a deal where you can get a bunch of cables for pennies on the dollar. Amazon is offering afive-pack of Lisen USB Type-C cablesin varying sizes for only $7.96 after a 50% off promo code ""UNWEXMFD"" is applied during checkout. That averages out to about $1.59 per cable. USB Type-C cables typically go for about $5-$10 per cable at your local big box store.

This bundle contains cables of varying sizes. They include two 3.3-feet cables, two 6.6-feet cables, and an extra long 10 foot cable. They're all rated for up to 60W of USB Power Delivery and are encased in a braided nylon sheath for extra durability and aeshetics. These cables have over 5,500 ratings on Amazon with an average 4.6-star review. Fakespot, a site that determines how many of the reviews are fake,gives this product a solid ""A"" rating, which is rather uncommon.
Amazon is offering a 6-foot INIU USB Type-A to USB Type-C cable for only $2.99 when you apply promo code ""C2ALZ6LN"" during checkout. You can add as many cables as you like and the discount should be applied to each and every cable. These cables are sheathed in nylon braiding for durability and can be used for both data sync and charging (Quick Charge 3.1A compatible). This is a great opportunity to stock up.
For a limited time, Amazon is offering the popularINIU 10,000mAh USB power bankfor just $8.99 after you clip the 10% off and 40% off clippable coupons on the product page. We very rarely see 10,000mAh power banks listed for under $10 so grab this one while you can. INIU power banks have solid reviews and are less expensive than equivalent Anker models.

"If you're looking for a new gaming monitor but you're on a tight budget, then this deal is right up your alley. Amazon is currently offering a27"" KTC gaming monitorfor only $92.99 shipped after you clip a $40 off coupon on the product page and apply another $7 off coupon code: ""05DMKTC38"". This item has over 1,800 reviews on Amazon with an average 4.4/5 star score and a respectableFakespot ""B"" rating. It has plenty of gaming features you wouldn't expect at this price point.

The KTC H27T13 is a 27"" monitor with a 2560x1440 resolution, which averages out to a sharp 109ppi pixel density. It's equipped with a pre-calibrated IPS panel with good color reproduction and wide viewing angles. It's decently fast with a refresh rate up to 100Hz and G-Sync compatibility. KTC includes a 3 year warranty.
If you're considering this monitor, chances are you're pairing it with a budget gaming PC setup. You probably don't need an expensive monitor with a 4K resolution that will overly tax your PC or 240Hz refresh rate that will be hard to achieve. G-Sync technology, however, is especially useful for these budget builds, since your fps is more likely to fluctuate than higher-end builds and adaptive sync helps provide a smoother and tear-free experience. This is a good monitor to pair with something like an RTX 4060, 4070, 5070, or the new Radeon RX 9070 GPU.

"My desk is filled with random, unnecessary gadgets from past Kickstarter campaigns, cool looking gizmos I saw on YouTube, or a Facebook ad that I succumbed to. One such item is thisDivoom Times Gate RGB LED Pixel Display Clock. It's currently $65.95 with free shipping after you apply a $6 off coupon code ""IFPQHLH"" in cart. The same item is currentlysells for $85 on Amazon. This item ships from a local US warehouse so you'll receive it within 1 or 2 weeks. This is one of those items that is definitely more flash than function, but you're guaranteed to get comments from anyone who sees it. You definitely don't want to pay the $150 MSRP for it, but at this price it's worth a look.

This cyberpunk styled clock isn't just a clock; it's actually comprised of five small LCD screens that can be configured to display all manners of digits, characters, or animated gifs of your choosing. The 128x128 resolution is sharp enough to display legible text and reasonably detailed images. Divoom also claims that you can connect to the internet using 802.11n WiFI if you want to run real-time updates like social media posts, weather, stocks, game scores, and more. Like I mentioned earlier, I actually own this gadget. In my personal experience, I had as much chance at successfully connecting to WiFi as I would hitting a bullseye with both hands tied behind my back. In the end, I just use it as a glorified clock. From a functional standpoint, was it worth it? Absolutely not, but it looks so darn cool on my desk that I feel no buyers remorse, even though I paid more than this deal.

"It's been on for nearly a week, but it's almost over. That's right,Amazon's Spring Sale 2025is will tragically end on March 31. That's the bad news. The good news is that it's still live now. All sorts of stuff is on sale, but I thought it would be neat to look at the bestsellers among IGN readers in the sale thus far. Below, you'll find the most popular deals that are still available in the sale. Without further ado, let's get to it.

Many product categories are represented in the list above; we're talking graphic novels,board games,LEGO sets,Apple products, and much more. Apple's AirPods 2 are down to an all-time low price. The board game Cascadia has been a huge seller and is avaliable for a terrific price. Check out ourCascadia reviewfor details about what makes it so worthwhile.
Venturing into tech products, you can save on a PlayStation Portal carrying case, one of thebest SSDs for PS5, and on a microSD card (you can never have enough of these chiclet-sized wonders, IMO). You can even save money on a Jurassic Park-themed version of the Game of Life. I mean, what more could you need?

"If you're looking for an affordable power bank that will fast charge your Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or Apple iPhone 16, then check out today's deal. Amazon has theIniu 10,000mAh Power Bankwith up to 45W of Power Delivery over USB Type-C for only $11.25 after you redeem the 50% off coupon on the product page. Iniu power banks have solid reviews and are less expensive than equivalent Anker models.

This Iniu power bank holds a 10,000mAh, or 37Whr battery capacity. If you factor in 80% power efficiency, here are the approximate number of times you can fully recharge each gaming handheld:
The Iniu power bank has three output ports: one built-in 45W USB Type-C cable, one 45W USB Type-C port, and one USB Type-A port. The 45W of Power Delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch (18W) and Steam Deck (40W) at their fastest rate. This power bank is also a solid choice for charging your Apple iPhone 16, sinceChargerLAB has shown that the maximum charging rate caps at about 30W, even for the Pro Max model.
We don't yet know what the maximum charging rate for theNintendo Switch 2will be, but we are hoping that it will be greater than the 18W maximum of the original Switch.We do know that the battery capacity is higher(5,220mAh vs 4,310mAh), so it's only natural to assume that the charging rate will also be higher to maintain the same recharging time. The Nintendo Switch 2's 5,200mAh capacity should translate to about 20Whr, which means this power bank will be able to charge it about 1.5 times.
The built-in cable is a popular feature on newer and generally pricier power banks because you no longer have to bring along your own USB Type-C cable. When you're on the go, the USB plug can be clipped onto the power bank to form a handy little lanyard. The cable itself is quite sturdy with a respectable break strength of 44 pounds and the lanyard loop when clipped to the power bank itself has a break strength of 13 pounds.

"One of the best 55"" OLED TVs is on sale for a limited time. Walmart is offering a55"" Samsung S90C 4K OLED Smart TVfor just $989 with free shipping. Beach Camera is the marketplace vendor and it is an authorized Samsung reseller, which means you get the full manufacturer's warranty. The S90C is a 2023 model, but it's a better TV than the2024 S85Dand nearly identical in image quality to the2024 S90D, which is currently selling for $200 more. Ideally you'll pair it with yourPlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or even theupcoming Switch 2 console.

Update:This TV is also available onAmazonfor a little more.
The Samsung S90C is a slightly older 2023 model (superseded by theS90Dfor 2024), but it's still considered to be one of the best OLED TVs available. That's because the S90C uses Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. It's generally considered better than LG's ""Evo"" technology found on the C-series TVs, which attempt to do the same thing. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. At the moment, there's no better panel technology that's readily available at a reasonable price.
OLED technology aside, the Samsung S90C also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz (rare in a 2023 TV) as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. The S90C also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode.

"Lenovo is offering the best deal right now on PlayStation 5 DualSense controllers. The Deep Earth Collection, which includes the metallicVolcanic Red,Cobalt Blue, andSterling Silver. colorways are on sale for $54 after you apply coupon code:PLAY5in your shopping cart. That's about 33% off and better thanAmazon's Spring Sale.

Lenovo might not be the first store you'd think of for great deals on PlayStation controllers, but surprisingly, no one can match their pricing. This might be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, at least untilSony's PlayStation Days of Play Salethat will probably happen sometime in late May.
The original PS5 DualSense controller is decked out in the same white color scheme as the console itself and retails for $69.99. Since then,Sony has consistently released more and more colors, some of them more striking than others. In late 2023, Sony launched theDeep Earth collection, ""a new metallic colorway for PS5 accessories"" with aptly sounding names like Sterling Silver, Volcanic Red, and Cobalt Blue. These controllers retailed for $79.99 and were (and still are) one of the more striking color schemes. We rarely see these on sale compared to the other colors.
Color aside, the Dualsense is oft regarded as thebest PS5 controller under $100. It also makes for an excellent controller for your PC. The DualSense is modeled after the tried and true design and layout of previous PlayStation controllers, but it also packs in modern features such as haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone and speaker, integrated touchpad, internal gyroscope and accelerometer for motion sensing, and USB Type-C charging.

"Amazon is offering the lowest price I've ever seen for a complete electric standing desk package that even includes a desktop. Right now you can pick up thisMarsail 48""x24"" Electric Standing Deskfor just $74.98 shipped. It comes with features that you wouldn't expect from a budget desk, like a keypad that can save up to four memory presets and side storage for magazines or notebooks. This desk has 530 4.6-star reviews on Amazon and has aFakespot A rating.

This Marsail electric standing desk includes a spliced 48x24 laminated desktop. Spliced desktops come in two pieces for easier shipping, so there's a seam the runs down the length of the table. It's not an issue for most people, but if you don't like it, you could always use your own desktop. The frame has a maximum weight limit of 100 pounds and adjustable height range of 27.5""-46.7"". The single motor operates at under 50db with a vertical travel speed of 2"" per second. The frame is the familiar two-legged affair with two-stage telescoping columns and a horizontal column that prevents desktop sag. The control panel has up and down buttons as well as four memory presets, so you can switch from your preferred sitting height to your preferred standing height with just a press of the button.
The desk comes flat packed so you'll have to assemble it yourself. Having installed well over a dozen of these desks, I can say for certain that it's not difficult at all. The hardest part is definitely just having enough arms (or arm strength) to flip the desk over. Almost every desk installs in roughly the same way, and this Marsail desk appears to be no different. Marsail covers this product with a five-year warranty on the frame and motor.
This 40""x24"" desk from AliExpress is priced the same and is great for people looking for a lighter toned option, with the wood colored desktop top and white legs. It ships free from a local US warehouse and will be delivered to your door within one to two weeks. This model has quite a few positive user reviews with photos.

"For a limited time, Amazon is offering the popularINIU 10,000mAh USB power bankfor just $8.99 after clipping the 10% off coupon on the product page and applying promo code ""4WJNEP2X"" during checkout. This is a new lower price than what we saw earlier this week. INIU power banks have solid reviews and are less expensive than equivalent Anker models.

This INIU power bank features a 10,000mAh (37Whr) capacity, which can charge a Nintendo Switch OLED from completely empty to full about 1.9 times, an iPhone 16 about 2.2 times, and an iPhone 16 Pro Max about 1.7 times. Note that this power bank doesn't have high speed Power Delivery, which means you're getting a maximum charging rate of about 15W. That's not quite fast enough to max out the charging rate of the iPhone or Switch (both cap at about 18-20W), it's not that much slower, and for $10 there's little reason to complain.
With a power bank this small, you don't need to worry about being stopped at airports. The 10,000mAh capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh carry-on limit. The INIU power bank is also slim and compact  so it's unlikely anyone will take notice in the first place. If a TSA official actually does take the initiative to test the wattage, you are well in the clear.

"AliExpress has dropped the price of the professional-gradeXbox Series X Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Controllerto only $74.42 shipped after you apply coupon code ""IFP3TXY""in cart. That's a huge price drop from its normal $140 list price and nearly the same cost as a standard Xbox controller. Note that this is a Hong Kong or Japanese import model in new retail packaging, but you won't find it cheaper anywhere else. AliExpress also offers a 90-day return policy on this item.

The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core wireless controller is physically the same controller as the older generation Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, which retails for a much higher $180. That means that the Core controller retains all the integrated pro gaming features like adjustable-tension thumbsticks, wrap-around rubberized grip, and shorter hair trigger locks. It's a much superior option to the standard Xbox Core controller that the current gen consoles come with.
Aside from the color scheme, theonlydifference is that the original Elite controller comes with more accessories: extra sets of paddles, thumbsticks, D-pad, and a travel case. The Elite Series 2 Core doesn't come with any of those accessories. You can buy them separately as acomponent packfor $59.99, however if you do want the component pack, you'll save money by getting the non-Core edition right off the bat (see below).
AliExpress also just dropped the price on a new retail boxed (imported) Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 wireless gaming controller – component pack included – to $100 shipped. This controller retails for $180 and the lowest price we've ever seen for this controller stateside is about $130-$140.

For just $49, theJLab JBuds Lux Over-Ear Headphonesoffers features you'd find in headphones that can cost 5x-10x as much, like wireless connectivity with Bluetooth Multipoint, active noise cancellation, spatial audio technology, and more. Most importantly, sound quality is better than any other headphone in its price range.

SoundGuys recently reviewed the JLab JBuds Luxand gave these headphones an absolutely glowing review, mentioning that they were one of the best headphones under $100. SoundGuys considered them an extremely good valueat their retail price of $79. At the current price of $49.99, it's hard to find a better bang for your buck, and it's especially nice that all four color options have been discounted.
The JLab JBuds Lux's laundry list of premium features include large 40mm drivers, Dolby Atmos compatible Spatial Audio, support for PlayStation Tempest 3D AudioTech and Windows Sonic, hybrid active noise cancellation, a ""Be Aware"" mode that lets you listen in on your environment, built-in microphone for hands-free calling, up to 70 hours of battery life on a single charge (40 hours with ANC enabled), USB Type-C charging, and Bluetooth Multipoint.
These headphones even look the part. The JLab JBuds Lux are thoughtfully designed for both comfort and performance, with cushy earcups that conform to your ear while also providing an effective seal for passive isolation, a padded headband for prolonged comfort, and a foldable design that makes them easy to tote around.

"Samsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.

4TB for $259.99
The Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.
The Samsung 990 Evo Plus does not have a preinstalled heatsink. However, the 990 Evo Plus SSD is a newer single-sided SSD design that is power efficient and doesn't generate as much heat as SSDs from before. That means you probably don't need to use a heatsink and it should still work perfectly fine in a PS5 console without any thermal throttling. That said, you certainly could for peace of mind and I wouldn't see any disadvantage to that aside fromspending an extra $7.

"TheLG UltraGear 27GX790A-B gaming monitorwas released at the tail end of 2024. This was LG's first ever OLED monitor with an incredible 480Hz refresh rate. It launched at a starting price of $999.99, which hadn't been discounted at all - until now. For a few days only, the LG online store is offering a 25% off coupon code ""SAVE25"" that drops the price by to $749.99 shipped. This is one of thebest 27"" QHD gaming monitorsyou can get right now, especially if you're aiming for the highest frame rates possible in your FPS games.

The LG UltraGear GX790 is a 27"" monitor with a 2560x1440 resolution (109ppi), 480Hz refresh rate, and G-Sync compatibility. This monitor uses LG's latest generation WOLED panel, which offers near instantaneous response times (0.03ms) and true black levels that can't be matched by any other panel type, including Mini-LED. The GX790 also boasts a 98.5% DCI-P3 color range, HDR True Black 400 certification, and is factory calibrated. Connectivity wise, the GX790 includes one DisplayPort 2.1 port (which you will need to use to get 480Hz), two HDMI 1.4 ports, and two USB 3.0 ports.
Because the GX790 combines an OLED panel with a super high refresh rate, it excels at games with a lot of fast or twitchy motion like shooters. To achieve framerates of up to 480fps at 2560x1440, you'll need to make sure your PC is equipped with the appropriate video card. Depending on the game, you'll probably need at least a graphics card like theGeForce RTX 4070. Games likeCounter-StrikeorFortnitehave less demanding needs thanCall of Duty: Black Ops 6.

"If you're looking for an affordable power bank that will fast charge your Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or Apple iPhone 16, then check out today's deal. Amazon has theIniu 10,000mAh Power Bankwith up to 45W of Power Delivery over USB Type-C for only $11.25 after you redeem the 50% off coupon on the product page. Iniu power banks have solid reviews and are less expensive than equivalent Anker models.

This Iniu power bank holds a 10,000mAh, or 37Whr battery capacity. If you factor in 80% power efficiency, here are the approximate number of times you can fully recharge each gaming handheld:
The Iniu power bank has three output ports: one built-in 45W USB Type-C cable, one 45W USB Type-C port, and one USB Type-A port. The 45W of Power Delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch (18W) and Steam Deck (40W) at their fastest rate. This power bank is also a solid choice for charging your Apple iPhone 16, sinceChargerLAB has shown that the maximum charging rate caps at about 30W, even for the Pro Max model.
We don't yet know what the maximum charging rate for theNintendo Switch 2will be, but we are hoping that it will be greater than the 18W maximum of the original Switch.We do know that the battery capacity is higher(5,220mAh vs 4,310mAh), so it's only natural to assume that the charging rate will also be higher to maintain the same recharging time. The Nintendo Switch 2's 5,200mAh capacity should translate to about 20Whr, which means this power bank will be able to charge it about 1.5 times.
The built-in cable is a popular feature on newer and generally pricier power banks because you no longer have to bring along your own USB Type-C cable. When you're on the go, the USB plug can be clipped onto the power bank to form a handy little lanyard. The cable itself is quite sturdy with a respectable break strength of 44 pounds and the lanyard loop when clipped to the power bank itself has a break strength of 13 pounds.

"Sonos doesn't discount its popular speakers very often, so it's a wise investment to jump on a good sale whenever you see one. Right now, bothSonos directandAmazonare offering one of Sonos' best speakers – the Sonos Arc soundbar – for only $599 after a hefty $300 off instant discount. This is the lowest price we've seen for the Sonos Arc and beats out last year's Black Friday deal by $100. In fact, this is currently less expensive than arefurbished Sonos Arc SLwhich isn't even equipped with a microphone for voice assistant functionality.

The Arc is one of Sonos' flagship products and was the best soundbar in its lineup until the recent release of theArc Ultra, which currently costs $350 more. This is a premium soundbar and it shows. You can't get much better in terms of sound quality from a soundbar, and that's thanks to its chunkier 45"" length. There's enough space in there to contain eleven precisely engineered internal speakers, including two dedicated height channels. It's Dolby Atmos ready and the Sonos Arc can easily be synced with other Sonos speakers and subs to add even more room-filling audio. This modularity is one of the main reasons why Sonos is so popular. It has other nifty features, like an ambient light sensor, HDMI eARC, capacitive touch controls, WiFi, and more. The Sonos Arc also has a built-in microphone so it can accept voice commands from Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and more.

"Editor’s note: This interview was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior toNintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States due to the potential impact of tariffs. Parts of this interview were edited for clarity.

Nintendo has finally pulled back the curtain onNintendo Switch 2, revealing the company's vision for its next-generation console and its games. Butovershadowing dicussion around what the Switch 2 is capable of, the new gameplay mechanics inMario Kart World, and OG Switch games that will find a new lease of life on Switch 2, isa backlash to Nintendo's pricing strategy.
We sat down with Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience Bill Trinen to talk about the big first-party reveals like Mario Kart World andDonkey Kong Bananza, the strategy behindpricing Switch 2 at $450andMario Kart at $80, the decision to releaseNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour as a paid digital productrather than a pack-in game, his excitement forMetroid Prime 4: Beyond's mouse controlsandMasahiro Sakurai's return to the Kirby franchise, and more. Plus, does Bill know what Switch 2 cartridges taste like? Read our full interview below to find out.
IGN:Congrats on finally unveiling Nintendo Switch 2. How does it feel to finally have it out there?
Bill Trinen:Well, it's just exciting to be able to get all the details out there. For us, the most important thing is that we really want people to recognize and understand that Nintendo Switch 2 is the true successor to Nintendo Switch, takes what you love about Nintendo Switch, and then builds on it with a whole lot of new features and new capabilities and new games that take advantage of those. And really takes what has evolved gaming with Nintendo into something that's a lot more social through things likeGameChat, which takes what was the anytime, anywhere play of Nintendo Switch and makes it more all together, anytime, anywhere.
IGN:So you just mentioned GameChat, that was a huge part of your presentation yesterday. Why was now the time to finally introduce Nintendo voice chat, which is something that people have wanted on your consoles for a really long time?
Trinen:Well, I would say we've always looked at it from the perspective of, 'what is Nintendo's real strength and what are Nintendo's real values?' And for us, the most important thing is putting smiles on people's faces and doing it in a way that people can see and experience the smiles that they have with the people that are most important to them.
And certainly there have been other game systems with chat and things like that up until now, but what we wanted to do was to take something that could finally replicate that same room, couch multiplayer, couch co-op experience and joy, and bring that into an online space. And so for us, GameChat is why it's so important is the combination of being able to see their faces, being able to see what they're doing from a gameplay perspective and being able to feel like you've finally got a virtual space where you can have those same experiences that you might have in your living room. So that's why with the power of, I would say Switch 2, being able to finally execute that has been a big focus for us.
IGN:Cool. And we always knew if you did voice chat, it would be in the most Nintendo way, and just with the camera and the mic on the unit in the dock and you say, 'oh, don't worry the background noise won't get in.' It was a cool presentation.
Trinen:Good. And that's the nice thing is with the built-in microphone, it's like, yeah, you can just voice chat if you want and you can do that portably as well.
IGN:Well, let's talk about Donkey Kong Bananza. I love the title by the way, it's perfect. Although last night when I was scrambling to typemy preview, it autocorrected to 'Bonanza' every time, and I was like, 'I’ve got to add this to my dictionary.' But I love the name and it's so exciting to see DK back in the spotlight after so long. And I noticed so many things just getting my hands on the controller for the first time. So when you guys got this game in at Nintendo of America, what stuck out to you the most? What was your favorite part about working on it from a localization perspective or anything else?
Trinen:Well, so I'll start with a really terrible joke, which is I like to call this the most groundbreaking game in video game history.
IGN:[Laughs] I used that in my preview today. I said, 'you have to break all the ground you can because you might make a groundbreaking discovery.'
Trinen:[Laughs] That's right. So for us, the number one thing that I think is probably just the most satisfying about this game is just DK the character. He's back, he's back in a big way. And DK is a character within the pantheon of Nintendo characters who has always been a bit on the more powerful side, wild at times, silly.
And all of that has just been thoroughly baked into this game. And as the character DK, you're able to use the power of his punches and you might attack an enemy in the environment, and that enemy goes flying and hits a wall and the wall crumbles and you see something there, and that then entices you to go in and start digging through the terrain to see what else you can find back there. And it just creates this incredibly rewarding cycle of destruction and discovery that is woven all throughout the game.
IGN:The discovery via destruction was a really cool cornerstone of this game from my time with it. I thought that was just really great. And the second that I started playing it, I just felt the DNA ofSuper Mario Odysseyand Mr. [Yoshiaki] Koizumi's team all over this in so many ways. Are they the ones that are working on this?
Trinen:It's a very good question. You'll have to stay tuned. We always like to start by showcasing the game and getting people focused on the gameplay, but we'll have some information to share about the developer in due time.
IGN:Okay. Can you tell me, is this internally developed? Because there hasn't been an internal Donkey Kong game since I believe Jungle Beat was the last one?
Trinen:Jungle Beat was the last one.
IGN:You had the NST (Nintendo Software Technology) do the Mario vs. Donkey Kongs, but...
Trinen:NST has done the Mario vs. Donkey Kong games, but this is going to be a fun one.
IGN:So nothing more on that?
Trinen:Nothing more on that yet.
IGN:Okay. I had to try. Let's talk about Mario Kart World, because there's so much great stuff in there, but I thinkthe cow is what's stealing everybody's heart. Did you expect that reaction? There's Akira memes about the cow, it's hilarious out there. Did you know the cow was going to be a big star?
Trinen:I would say perhaps not as big as the cow has become. Internally, certainly the very first moment that we saw the cow, everybody wanted to play as Cow.
IGN:When we were playing Knockout Tour yesterday, there were just like seven cows on the track.
Trinen:Well, that's the other thing that I just love about Mario Kart World is with the interconnected world of tracks, as I'm driving, you'll start something like Knockout Tour and you'll be driving across the continent. And what used to be the Mario Kart model was there's discrete tracks and you race on a discrete track and then you choose a different track and you race on a different discrete track.
And now what I find is I'm driving through, I'm starting in a new track and driving across the terrain and, 'Oh, I just happened to pass through Moo Moo Meadows and now I'm onto the next thing.' And it's just like for somebody that's grown up playing Mario Kart for so many years, just to be able to have that experience and piece it all together mentally into this big massive continent of racing has been a whole lot of fun for me.
IGN:It feels like a theme park of Mario Kart history, and I'm driving yesterday and going through all the different segments and then all of a sudden, 'Oh, I'm in the geyser tunnel from Dino Dino Jungle from Double Dash.' But I'm wondering, so right now it seems like the races, you start at one track and end up at another, and then the final lap is one loop around that final circuit you end up at. Not in the Knockout Tour, that's different, but is there a time trial or versus race mode that’s a way to just do three laps at this track? Or are you always driving interconnected between them when you're racing?
Trinen:You will have abilities to drive three laps on certain tracks. Obviously we've got a Nintendo Direct dedicated to Mario Kart World coming. I think you'll see a lot more on the game there, and I think a lot more that will hopefully surprise you and make you really feel like, 'Wow, there's a lot to this game.'
IGN:That will be really good to see. Because right now it looks great, it plays great, but I think the talk of the town is the price tag. This is an $80 game from Nintendo in the United States and $50 if you buy the Nintendo Switch 2 bundle. But I saw somewhere on your website that that bundle is only available for a limited time while supplies last. Can you just talk about the strategy behind pricing Mario Kart World this way?
Trinen:Well, I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value? Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, but I did read your article this morning and I think you had mentioned that you didn’t find a lot to discover when roaming around. So I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out about that.
But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.
IGN:Okay. And to just stay on pricing for a little bit here.I'm looking at the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of games and some games are $70, some are $80. That's what it's looking like right now. And some are cheaper than that too. I don't think we know the U.S. price for the Welcome Tour yet, but I think we saw the Japanese price is around $10.
Trinen:Yeah, the U.S. price is $9.99 for the Welcome Tour.
IGN:$9.99. Okay, digital only.
Trinen:Yes.
IGN:I'm just wondering about the strategy behind pricing these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions at the combination of the Switch 1 retail price, usually $59.99, and then whatever that upgrade path is, like $10 for Breath of the Wild, making that a $70 game, or Tears of the Kingdom is an $80 game because it's $70 plus the $10 upgrade path. Can you just walk me through the strategy behind not offering any sort of discount for newcomers on Switch 2 and saying, 'Tears of the Kingdom is $80 now just like Mario Kart is?'
Trinen:Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?' What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you're looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that's the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game.
For somebody who has bought Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the Zelda upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership. So there's no additional charge for those. But I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that.
IGN:Okay, thanks. And then the pricing for the console itself, too. A lot of people are talking about it — $450 in the United States, and we know there are definitely global economic factors at play. Can you share anything behind the strategy for pricing of the console? Was this something that was up to the wire where you didn't know what it was going to cost until recently? Can you share any insight?
Trinen:Can't really share insight into any of that. Obviously the cost of everything goes up over time, and I personally would love if the cost of things didn't go up over time. But I think any time you're building a new system that's got new features and new tech, there's costs associated with that. So again, we look at what is the experience on Nintendo Switch? What's the experience on Nintendo Switch 2? What are the new features that it offers? And certainly there's the cost of goods and things that factor into that, but we try to find the right appropriate price for a product based on that.
IGN:Last question on price, I promise. I played Welcome Tour on the show floor and I walked away and thought, 'this is a perfect pack-in game.' It shows what the console is, it shows HDR, it shows these new technologies Nintendo is embracing — in some cases for the first time — and I feel like it's a great showcase for the console. Was there ever any talk of making this a pack-in game, and why did you make the decision to price it as a separate digital product?
Trinen:It's an interesting product. We're actually getting ready today, we're going to be doing someNintendo Treehouse Live segmentsand covering a lot of games in detail. That's one of them. And I think people will be able to see through Treehouse Live probably a little bit more maybe than you were able to see on the show floor. It's a pretty robust piece of software. There's a lot of great detail in there.
For some people, I think there are people who are particularly interested in the tech and the specs of the system and things like that, for them I think it's going to be a great product. It's really for people that want more information about the system rather than necessarily a quick intro to everything it does. And for that reason and just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, 'Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you're getting out of the product.'
IGN:Okay. I want to talk about some of the features of the Joy-Con 2 now because I was really impressed with the mouse functionality. I thought that it worked really, really well in something like Metroid Prime 4. I can see that being the preferred way for a lot of people to play that game. So what are your expectations for mouse controls? Are you hoping that third-party developers make great use of them? Do you think it can bring new types of games? Just talk to me about your feelings about the mouse.
Trinen:Well, personally, I'm really excited about the mouse control. I don't know what your experience with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was, the way that to me is probably my favorite way to play is I like to play split Joy-Con. I just like the freedom of having my hands not locked onto a controller like that. So I often like to play split Joy-Con and having the freedom to just seamlessly drop the mouse down for combat and then pick it back up for split Joy-Con, to me is something, number one, you can't do with any other console, you can't do on PC.
And it makes for a really great experience for the Prime series, particularly because the Prime series is the creator of the first-person adventure genre. And so in a series where you're doing a lot of exploration that's got some combat mixed in with it, that freedom feels right. Because for me, I feel like if I'm doing a lot of exploration, I want to be split Joy-Con. That flexibility to me is amazing.
I think the other thing that probably I'm hoping people are catching onto is that, yes, the Joy-Con 2 introduced mouse control, but they introduce mouse control in conjunction with the other technology within the Joy-Con. So whereas with a PC mouse, you're moving up and down and side to side and whatnot, with the Joy-Con, you've got the added ability to apply things like the angle that you're twisting the Joy-Con at, and having that also impact the play control with the mouse.
Or you've got two Joy-Con that have mouse control each, and that means two things. It means either you can have immediate two-player mouse control gameplay right out of the box with the Nintendo Switch 2, or it means, as we see withDrag x Drive, that you can do things with dual Joy-Con control, which hasn't been done before. And so my hope is really threefold. One, is that our own development teams continue to experiment with what they can do with the mouse to create creative new ways to use it.
I hope that we start to see third-parties that are then looking at opportunities with things like dual mouse control or combination of mouse plus motion control to evolve their gameplay. But I also do hope that when you look at PC developers, for example, if they want to bring a PC-based game to console, they have to spend a lot of time revamping the control scheme and adapting it to button controls. And so having the freedom of mouse control with the Joy-Con hopefully makes PC developers a lot more eager to want to bring their games to Nintendo Switch 2.
IGN:Well, my social team really wants to know. We don't have Switch 2 cartridges here. Do they taste like Switch 1 cartridges?
Trinen:[Laughs] I don't know yet.
IGN:You haven't done a taste test?
Trinen:I have not done a taste test. I keep hoping for pistachio flavor, but that's not happening.
IGN:[Laughs] I don't think that would turn away the kids. Okay, cool. Well, my last question here is that Kirby Air Riders was a huge surprise at the Nintendo Direct yesterday. And to see that is this secret project thatMr. [Masahiro] Sakurai teased earlier this year after wrapping up his YouTube series. Cool to see him come back to work with you guys again. Can you share any details further than that teaser we got in the Direct?
Trinen:Well, I believe Mr. Sakurai has said that there will not be any additional information on the game for quite a while. The team's working very hard on it. But for me, this was probably one of the most exciting announcements for a couple of reasons.
One, I'm always excited to see what Sakurai-san is working on. Two, he created the Kirby character and the Kirby franchise. And so it's great to see him come back to lead and direct a Kirby game again for the first time in a couple of decades. But I think more importantly, I've always felt that Kirby Air Ride on GameCube was a game that was ahead of its time and maybe not fully understood at the time that it came out.
And so I'm just really excited because there's a core group of people that played that game on GameCube that love it to death. And number one, I'm just happy because for them, this is such a big announcement and it's so good to see their excitement. But at the same time, I think that with where we are in the game industry today, I think we've got a real opportunity to introduce a much bigger audience to Kirby Air Riders. And I think people will finally really begin to appreciate just what I think is the genius of Masahiro Sakurai and what he created with that game.
IGN:Well, I'm in that core group. It's like one of my big childhood games. I love Kirby Air Ride, City Trial Free Roam. That's all I was doing, so I'm very excited. But thanks so much, Bill. We're super excited for June 5 and everything else that's coming on the way.
Trinen:Great. Thank you.

Disney Experiences Chairman Josh D'Amaro and Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman led the festivities and discussed what their teams are working on and how beneficial it is when they collaborate for exciting new experiences at Disney Parks.
There was a ton discussed, and we've gathered all the biggest announcements and reveals below!
While we knewThe Mandalorian and Grogu would be part of a new story on Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Runat Walt Disney World and Disneyland, Disney confirmedthe new experience would debut alongside The Mandalorian & Grogu movie on May 22, 2026.
The Mandalorian creator Jon Favreau and Imagineers Leslie Evans and Asa Kalama shared a bit more about the upcoming new story and revealed some concept art of locations that should excite fans of that galaxy far, far away. The images, which you can see below, include a Jawa's Sandcrawler on Tatooine, the Millennium Falcon and Mando's Razor Crest flying toward Cloud City on Bespin, and even a tease of visit to the wreckage of the second Death Star above Endor.
Imagineers captured scenes for this new story from the set of The Mandalorian & Grogu, meaning it should feelveryauthentic when it goes live.
In addition, it was also revealed that the wonderful BDX droids that have been seen at Disneyland will soon be making their way to Walt Disney World, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris. There will even be a new variant as an Anzellan (like Babu Frik!) named Otto will sometimes appear on a BDX that needs a little tune up.
Oh, and if that wasn't enough BDX goodness for you, the team shared these droids will be making an appearance in The Mandalorian & Grogu.
Monsters, Inc. Land is coming soon to Disney World's Hollywood Studiosand it will include an exciting new themed roller coaster that will be Disney Park's first-ever suspended coaster andits first with a vertical lift.
This new attraction aims to give guests the dream-come-true moment of soaring through Monsters, Inc.'s door vault and Disney shared a first look at the load area and how it should set the tone very well of what's to come.
We still have much to learn about this new attraction and the land it will live in, but this is an exciting tease nonetheless.
Pixar Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter and Imagineer Michael Hundgen sharednew details about the upcoming Cars attractionthat will be part ofthe new Cars-themed landthat is currently in development at Magic Kingdom.
“Our primary goal is creating an emotional experience for our guests,” Hundgen said. “For thisCarsattraction, we need to invent a new type of ride vehicle. No one builds these in a factory because it has to do so much more than just carrying you from one place to another. We have to create a car that conveys a feeling when you ride in it.”
The team needed some real-world data to help in their research so they went to the Arizona desert to ride in an off-road vehicle and take off over rocky terrain. This new ride doesn't take place in Radiator Springs, but instead it will be a thrilling rally race through the mountains, so they want it to feel just right.
From there, they worked with a motocross company to build a dirt track of their own to race around and used that to develop what will eventually be the ride vehicle.
""We’re using a customized production vehicle,” Hundgen continued. “It has sensors all over it, and we’re taking it for test drives on our dirt track to gather data on how the vehicle responds to different terrain. This is where we turn that feeling we want into real-world engineering.""
These vehicles will also get some Disney and Pixar magic thrown in as each car will have its own personality, name, and number.
Disneyland's Avengers Campus is getting two new attractions, including one calledAvengers Infinity Defensewhere guests will team up with members of the Avengers to take on King Thanos across multiple worlds. However, the second one was the star of Disney's SXSW panel asRobert Downey Jr. himself stopped by to share new details about it.
It's been previously revealed thatDowney Jr. would be returning as Tony Stark for Avengers Campus' Stark Flight Lab,an attraction that will take guests into Tony's workshop and allow them to experience some of the new tech he's been working on.
Downey Jr. said these new experiences are ""the living embodiment of the Stark Enterprises mission statement.""
“The curiosity, the passion, the inventiveness, the occasional flair for the dramatic, most of all a drive to put something good out into the world to make life better, at the minimum more fun by a mile, ” Downey continued. “It’s the privilege of a lifetime to be invited to participate.”
As for the ride itself, guests will sit in ""gyro-kinetic pods"" and will eventually be grabbed by a giant robot arm who will help them make ""several high-speed maneuvers inspired by Iron Man and some other Avengers.""
""Transferring from a track to a robot arm and then back again – nothing like this has ever been done before in a theme park, and we’re so excited about it,” Chief Creative Officer for Walt Disney Imagineering Bruce Vaughn explained. “Usually, we hide all the tech behind the scenes so you can focus on the story. Here, the tech IS the story, so we’re putting it front and center.”
One of they ways Imagineering is making the tech the star of this attraction is the focus on that robotic arm, which actually takes heavy inspiration from Tony Stark's little robotic friend, DUM-E. The team enlisted the help of dancers and motion capture to help make these robots feel as real as possible.

"Apple's newest AirPods are all on sale as part of the bigAmazon Spring Salethat starts today. Starting with the highest end model, the second generationApple AirPods Prowireless noise-canceling earbuds is $169.99 shipped (normally $240). The next step down, theApple AirPods 4 with ANC(active noise cancelation) is down to $149.99 (normally $179). Finally, the value-packedAirPods 4 without ANCdrops to $99.99 (normally $129). iPhone users, these are without a doubt the best earbuds to pair with your smartphone.

The AirPods Pro is the best-sounding ""truly wireless"" earbuds for iPhone users thanks to its passively isolating in-ear design combined with excellent active noise cancelation, low-distortion driver and amp, and the Apple H2 chip. It also has useful features like Adaptive Transparency Mode, which lets you better hear your surroundings without removing your earbuds, and Conversation Mode, which automatically enhances the voices of people you're talking to. The second generation AirPods Pro replaces the Lightning port with a more universal USB Type-C port so you don't have to mix and match cables, and also includes a MagSafe charging case as standard.
The Apple AirPods 4 was released on September, 2024 in two variants: both models are mostly identical with the exception of the noise canceling functionality on the more expensive one. The AirPods 4 features several updates over the AirPods 3 which brings it in-line with modern day standards. These improvements include the newer Apple H2 chip (vs H1), Bluetooth 5.3 support (vs Bluetooth 5.0), better IP54 resistance rating which now protects against dust intrustion (vs IPX4), USB Type-C (vs Lightning), and replacement of the skin detect sensor with a more reliable optical in-ear sensor.
The AirPods Pro is a superior earbud, which is why it retails for $70 more than the AirPods 4 ANC. Both feature active noise cancelation, but the AirPods Pro produces better sound quality and more effective noise canceling because of its design. The AirPods 4 ANC is an open-ear style earbud with non-adjustable tips. They're designed to sit right outside of the ear which – while comfortable – means you get plenty of sound leakage and ambient noise intrusion.
On the other hand, the AirPods Pro is an in-ear style of earbud that sits right inside your ear canal, sealing the passage and passively isolating it from the ambient air. Adjustable tips are included to accomodate different sized ears and ensure you get that proper sealing fit, which is very important to squeeze out the best performance. At this price, the only compelling reason to still go for the AirPods 4 ANC is if you don't like the intrusive nature of in-ear style earbuds in general.

"Don't miss out on one of the best deals to happen during theAmazon Spring Sale. Right now you can pick up the venerableSony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphonesfor only $249.99 shipped. That's $80 less than Black Friday and currently the same price as its XM4 predecssor. It's the lowest price we've ever seen for this model. The WH-1000XM5 is considered by many to be thebest noise cancelling headphonesunder $400.

Sony WH1000XM5 Reviewby Kevin Lee
""The Sony WH-1000XM5 is the big upgrade we’ve been waiting for from Sony’s flagship wireless headphones. The new design and AI makes the noise-canceling stronger while the ambient listening mode is splendidly natural. Audio quality is impeccable too – whether you want to listen to intricate classical music or a rocking action movie, these headphones can do it all.""
The prior generation Sony XM4 was already an outstanding headphone, but the XM5 features key improvements in noise cancellation and comfort. The XM5 has been fitted with a second processor and double the microphone count dedicated to filtering out ambient noise. The earcups have also been redesigned so that they fit more snugly on the ear, thus creating a better seal and as a result, more effective passive noise isolation. The noise cancelling is noticeably better than the XM4 and pretty much any other noise cancelling headset in its price range.
The Sony WH-1000XM5 has also been updated with a noticeably sleeker redesign with a different style of headband adjustment. The band is wider than before for better weight distribution and the earcup padding is now made of a luxurious synthetic leather material that's softer and more comfortable. You can easily wear these headphones for hours. One small drawback, however, is that the XM5 can no longer be folded inward, only swivelled, so it's less compact.
The Sony WH-1000XM5 retains the XM4's excellent battery life at over 30 hours on a single charge even with ANC activated. The XM5 also supports fast charging over USB Type-C.
Best of all, at this price, the XM5 is considerably less expensive than its competitors like theBose QuietComfort Ultraand theAirPods Max. If you're already in the market for a premium noise cancelling headphone, you should jump on this deal.

"Nintendo has confirmed that those sleek new Switch 2 game cards won’t always carry an actual game and will, instead, sometimes simply contain a key for a game download.

The Super Mario Bros. company detailed how it will update its approach to physical game cartridges in acustomer support postpublished shortly after this morning’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. It explains that, when the Switch 2arrives this June, you’ll be able to carry on purchasing physical Switch games just as you’ve done for the last eight years, but there are a few things to keep in mind.
The post in question focuses on game-key cards: physical cards that only contain a key to download your chosen game. That means there’s no actual game data on the card you insert into your Switch 2, so you’ll need to download it once the card is inserted. Every game-key card case will be appropriately labeled on the lower portion of the front of the box, so if you’re concerned about what exactly you’re purchasing, you should have a heads-up right away.
News that Nintendo will utilize these game-key cards for Switch 2 has already taken hold of physical gaming fans who prefer the simplicity of plug-in-play without the need for lengthy download periods and an internet connection to get set up. The concern is that these are little more than fancy key holders that will soon replace all standard cartridges, but there are few reasons to believe this is actually the case for now.
Many have already taken to social media to point out that, while some early looks at Switch 2 box art, including covers for games likeStreet Fighter 6and theBravely Default remaster, do indeed feature that game-key card disclaimer, others, such asMario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananza, do not.
It appears the game-key card approach will likely be reserved for a few especially hefty games that might benefit from the key strategy, such as something like Hogwarts Legacy or Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Even then, developer CD Projekt Red hasalready confirmed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will ship with a game cardthat comes in at a whopping 64 GB on the Switch 2’s launch day.
Additionally, as explained during the Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo seems pretty proud ofthe new tech its upgraded red game cards support. They’re said to come with faster data reading speeds than what was seen with the original hybrid console from 2017, a fact the company wouldn’t need to point out if all of its cartridges were simple key containers. Let's not forget that Nintendo has bent the definition of what a game card offers before, with some notable original Switch examples beingLA NoireandNBA 2K18, which both required additional downloads out of the box.
It’s far too soon to tell just how many Switch 2 games will rely on game-key cards, but we know all will be revealed as launch draws closer. For now, the Nintendo Switch 2 is primed to click into action come June 5, 2025. For everything revealed during today’s all-encompassing Direct, clickhere.

"If you're in the process of building out a new gaming PC and you're looking for the best gaming processor, this is it. Right now, the recently releasedAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DAM5 desktop processor is back in stock on Amazon and Best Buy at its retail price of $479 shipped. This is the official launch price with zero markup, and it's not bundled with anything you don't want or need. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming processor currently on the market (across both AMD and Intel) and a better choice for gamers than the more expensiveIntel Core Ultra 9 285K.

AMD's X3D series processors are optimized for gaming. In that respect, they bench better than even the most expensive of AMD's standard lineup of CPUs thanks to AMD's 3D V-Cache technology. Although perfectly capable of handling multitasking, rendering, and creation, the limited number of cores means they aren't the ideal processors for those tasks. At its retail price of $479, the 9800X3D is $110 cheaper than theIntel Core Ultra 9 285K($589) and $170 cheaper than theAMD Ryzen 9 9950X, even though it outperforms both of them in gaming. Unless you're a staunch Intel fan, or you're still on AM4 and don't want to upgrade all of your components, the 9800X3D is the obvious choice for your next gaming rig.
""The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is extremely powerful in games, which makes it easier to recommend than other recent processors like the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K or Ryzen 9 9900X. Especially if you’re building a rig with a powerful graphics card, the 9800X3D is going to be the best way to get the most performance out of whichever GPU you pair it with.""
If you decided to hold off on Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs to see if AMD's new offerings were up to snuff, then you made the right choice. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards are the new mid-range champions of this generation. Both cards offer phenomenal performance while undercutting their Nvidia competition in price. The Radeon RX 9070 starts at $550 and the 9070 XT starts at $600 (although it turns out that manufacturers are hiking the price again). Chect out ourRadeon RX 9070 GPU reviewandRadeon RX 9070 XT GPU reviewfor our benchmarks.

"If you're looking for an affordable power bank that will fast charge your Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or Apple iPhone 16, then check out today's deal. Amazon has theIniu 10,000mAh Power Bankwith up to 45W of Power Delivery over USB Type-C for only $11.25 after you redeem the 50% off coupon on the product page. Iniu power banks have solid reviews and are less expensive than equivalent Anker models.

This Iniu power bank holds a 10,000mAh, or 37Whr battery capacity. If you factor in 80% power efficiency, here are the approximate number of times you can fully recharge each gaming handheld:
The Iniu power bank has three output ports: one built-in 45W USB Type-C cable, one 45W USB Type-C port, and one USB Type-A port. The 45W of Power Delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch (18W) and Steam Deck (40W) at their fastest rate. This power bank is also a solid choice for charging your Apple iPhone 16, sinceChargerLAB has shown that the maximum charging rate caps at about 30W, even for the Pro Max model.
We don't yet know what the maximum charging rate for theNintendo Switch 2will be, but we are hoping that it will be greater than the 18W maximum of the original Switch.We do know that the battery capacity is higher(5,220mAh vs 4,310mAh), so it's only natural to assume that the charging rate will also be higher to maintain the same recharging time. The Nintendo Switch 2's 5,200mAh capacity should translate to about 20Whr, which means this power bank will be able to charge it about 1.5 times.
The built-in cable is a popular feature on newer and generally pricier power banks because you no longer have to bring along your own USB Type-C cable. When you're on the go, the USB plug can be clipped onto the power bank to form a handy little lanyard. The cable itself is quite sturdy with a respectable break strength of 44 pounds and the lanyard loop when clipped to the power bank itself has a break strength of 13 pounds.

"A Black Friday deal on one of the best OLED TVs is back. Starting today,AmazonandSamsungare offering the 2024 65"" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV for only $1,399.99 shipped after $1,300 in instant savings. This is anexcellent TV to pair up with your PlayStation 5or Xbox Series X. This TV is considered to as good as or better than the popular LG C4 OLED TV. According toRTINGS, the Samsung S90D is a brighter TV with a wider color gamut, better color volume, wider viewing angle, and better HDR gradient handling.

The Samsung S90D is the current generation 2024 model. A new ""S90F"" model was announced during CES 2025, but it has yet to be released. This TV is equipped with Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times.
OLED technology aside, the Samsung S90D also has all the features you'd want in agaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming console. The S90D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to the recently releasedPlaystation 5 Proconsole since it can drive more games in quality mode (native 4K @ 120fps) than the standard PS5, which often needs to be set to performance mode (upscaled 4K).
If you're looking for a smaller size, the 42"", 48"", and 55"" models are also on sale. The 42"" model is ideal for PC monitor use. At that screen size, the 4K resolution equates to a respectable 104ppi pixel density and supports chroma 4:4:4 subsampling for clear, legible text. The HDMI 2.1 input supports refresh rates of up to 144Hz over 4K resolution.
For this week only, Best Buy is offering the 77"" Samsung S84D 4K OLED smart TV for $1,499.99. That's only $150 more than the 65"" S90D model for a 40% larger screen size. The S84D is Best Buy's exclusive model that's identical to the S85D but with slightly better speakers (30W vs 20W). Compared to the S90D, the S84D is a step down in image quality since it doesn't utilize quantum dot technology and the refresh rate is limited to 120Hz instead of 144Hz. However, it's still an outstanding TV compared to other TVs on the market and an excellent value at this price.

"You don't have to wait for the new 2025 LG TVs to drop to score a great deal on an older generation model. Right now, you can pick up a 202365"" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TVfor just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday. The LG Evo C-series of TVs have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVs, especially for 4K HDR movies and gaming.

The LG Evo C3 is a 2023 model, just one year behind the 2024 LG Evo C4. So what are the differences? Aside from the $650 price difference, not much. The most important trait -- picture quality -- is more or less identical. Where the C4 improves on the C3 are an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate.
OLED TVs are considered the best TVs you can buy right now. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, they offer better image quality, deeper blacks, better contrast ratio, wider color gamut, and super fast response times. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV are easily the best type of TV for viewing 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations.
The LG C3 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel and all four HDMI 2.1 ports for running 4K at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. It also supports variable refresh rate (VRR), auto low latency mode (ALLM), and DTS audio, which is good for people who still watch Blu-ray discs. The C3 is also much easier to set up than its predecessors; the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that drops the weight to a mere 36 pounds.
The LG Evo C-series TV is ourfavorite high-end 4K TV of 2025because of the brilliance of its OLED display along with a host of quality features that don't quite push it to the point of an excessively high price. This model brings better contrast and clarity than the previous year's already luminous LG C2. It’s a sight to behold, especially when you add in the deep blacks and well-balanced colors on the crisp 4K screen. Once you choose OLED, it's hard to go back to anything else.
The LG Evo C5 hasn't yet been released, butit was showcased during CES 2025. At least on paper, the improvements of the C5 seem to be incremental, with no major ground breaking updates that would make you want to hold off until its launch. More importantly, the C5 will probably release at a very high retail price which will take months to get down to a level that's competitive with other TV deals.

"Here's your chance to get a massive, top notch OLED TV at one of the lowest prices we've seen, especially for a recent Samsung model. Right now, both Best Buy offering the83"" Samsung S85D 4K OLED Smart TVfor just $1,799.99 with free delivery. This is such a big discount that even the next size down (77"") at this price would have been a good purchase. This is anexcellent TV to pair up with your PlayStation 5or Xbox Series X since it has HDMI 2.1 inputs and supports 4K gaming at up to 120Hz.

The Samsung S85D is the most affordable TV in Samsung's 2024 OLED lineup. Unlike the higher-end S90D which uses a quantum dot OLED panel (and costs $500 more), the S85D uses a standard W-OLED panel. In terms of image quality, it's directly comparable to the LG B4 OLED TV (which costs $200 more). Since this is a true OLED panel, the S85D boasts near instantaneous response time, near infinite contrast ratio, and true blacks. It's superior to any other panel type for most use cases. For those of you who are concerned with burn-in, it's rarely an issue with OLED TVs; it's more of a concern with computer monitors where static screens (like your desktop) are more common.
The Samsung S85D also has the necessary features you'd want in a current-gengaming TV, like HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 120Hz panel forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. The S85D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to thePlaystation 5 Proconsole, since it has the power to run most games in true 4K resolution (vs upscaled 1440p in ""Performance"" mode) at 120Hz.
Right now this is the lowest price we can find for a brand new and fully warrantied 65"" OLED TV, especially if you want to stick with a tried and true brand like Samsung. If you're wondering how this TV stacks up to the new 2025 OLED TVs, it looks like most of the improvements are incremental: highlights include a slightly faster processor or better anti-glare coating. The panel technology is largely identical to 2024 models.

Both feature active noise cancelation, but the AirPods Pro produces better sound quality and more effective noise canceling because of its design. The AirPods 4 ANC is an open-ear style earbud with non-adjustable tips. They're designed to sit right outside of the ear which – while comfortable – means you get plenty of sound leakage and ambient noise intrusion.
On the other hand, the AirPods Pro is an in-ear style of earbud that sits right inside your ear canal, sealing the passage and passively isolating it from the ambient air. Adjustable tips are included to accomodate different sized ears and ensure you get that proper sealing fit, which is very important to squeeze out the best performance. At this price, the only compelling reason to still go for the AirPods 4 ANC is if you don't like the intrusive nature of in-ear style earbuds in general.

"Here's your chance to get a massive, top notch OLED TV at one of the lowest prices we've seen, especially for a recent Samsung model. Right now, both Best Buy offering the83"" Samsung S85D 4K OLED Smart TVfor just $1,799.99 with free delivery. This is such a big discount that even the next size down (77"") at this price would have been a good purchase. This is anexcellent TV to pair up with your PlayStation 5or Xbox Series X since it has HDMI 2.1 inputs and supports 4K gaming at up to 120Hz.

The Samsung S85D is the most affordable TV in Samsung's 2024 OLED lineup. Unlike the higher-end S90D which uses a quantum dot OLED panel (and costs $500 more), the S85D uses a standard W-OLED panel. In terms of image quality, it's directly comparable to the LG B4 OLED TV (which costs $200 more). Since this is a true OLED panel, the S85D boasts near instantaneous response time, near infinite contrast ratio, and true blacks. It's superior to any other panel type for most use cases. For those of you who are concerned with burn-in, it's rarely an issue with OLED TVs; it's more of a concern with computer monitors where static screens (like your desktop) are more common.
The Samsung S85D also has the necessary features you'd want in a current-gengaming TV, like HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 120Hz panel forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. The S85D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to thePlaystation 5 Proconsole, since it has the power to run most games in true 4K resolution (vs upscaled 1440p in ""Performance"" mode) at 120Hz.
Right now this is the lowest price we can find for a brand new and fully warrantied 65"" OLED TV, especially if you want to stick with a tried and true brand like Samsung. If you're wondering how this TV stacks up to the new 2025 OLED TVs, it looks like most of the improvements are incremental: highlights include a slightly faster processor or better anti-glare coating. The panel technology is largely identical to 2024 models.

"If you're looking for an OLED TV from a reputable brand name at a great price, then Best Buy has got a solid deal going on right now. The Sony Bravia XR A75L 4K OLED smart TVs are on sale right now with the 55"" model priced at $999.99 and the 65"" model for $1,299.99. These prices are lower than what we saw during Black Friday (the 65"" model was $1499 at the time). Although the A75L is an older generation (2023) TV, it's still one of the best TVs out there in terms of image quality and gaming performance. Especially for the 55"" model, you won't find a better TV for under $1,000.

Generally speaking, OLED TVs are considered the best TVs you can buy right now. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, they offer better image quality, deeper blacks, better contrast ratio, wider color gamut, and super fast response times. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV are easily the best type of TV for viewing 4K HDR content in all of its glory.
OLED technology aside, the A75L has  the features you'd want in a current generation gaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel as well as two HDMI 2.1 ports that can run games in 4K at up to 120fps on a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming console. The OLED panel benefits from a near instantaneous response time (sub 0,.03ms) and supports features like variable refresh rate (VRR) including G-SYNC and auto low latency mode (ALLM). Note that despite this being a Sony TV, it pairs equally well with an Xbox console.
Sony OLED TVs use Google TV as its smart interface. Google TV is intuitive to use and supports voice commands through Google Assistant. You can also pair it with an Android phone to use as a remote.
You don't have to wait for the new 2025 LG TVs to drop to score a great deal on an older generation model. Right now, you can pick up a 202365"" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TVfor just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday. The LG Evo C-series of TVs have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVs, especially for 4K HDR movies and gaming.

"Amazon has recently dropped the price on the2TB SK Hynix P41 PlatinumPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVME solid state drive (SSD) to only $124.99 shipped. The SK Hynix P41 Platinum is one of thefastest PCI-E 4.0 SSDs available, has DRAM cache, and is considerably less expensive than other comparable SSDs like theSamsung 990 Pro($168) and theWD SN850X($154). This is an excellent SSD for either your PlayStation 5 console or gaming PC.

Update:Price has dropped again from $129.99 to $124.99.
SK Hynix might not be as recognizable of a brand as Samsung or Western Digital among consumers, but make no mistake that they are a major player in the flash memory market. SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and one of the world's largest memory chipmakers and semiconductor companies. They supply components for many reputable brands you've probably heard of, like Corsair and G.Skill.
The Platinum P41 is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read speeds of 7,000MB/s and write speeds of 6,500MB/s as well as random read speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and write speeds of 1.3 million IOPS. The Platinum P41 also has a dedicated DRAM cache, Most SSDs at this price point lack any DRAM cache and instead rely on HMB, or system memory, to cover the shortfall. In terms of reliability and stability, th Platinum P41 has been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written. It uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips, both of which are manufactured in-house. SK Hynix warranties this SSD with a 5 year warranty.
The SK Hynix P41 Platinum makes for a great secondary SSD for your PlayStation 5 console since it performs well above Sony's minimum speed recommendation of 5,600MB/s. It's possible this SSD will run fine without a heatsink, but we like to err on the side of caution and would recommend you install one for peace of mind. Besides, you can get a perfectly adequateslim PS5 heatsink for just $7.
The Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. Forgaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.

"It usually feels like we have to wait for Black Friday for great deals on PlayStation Store credit, but ShopTo's getting ahead with a combination of a price slash and a discount code to give you money off theirfull range of gift cards.

While the best deal among them all is17.4% off the £70 PSN gift card, you'll be able to get free money in credit on each selection to spend on more games, subscriptions, or add-on content.
To clarify, you will be able to save on any of ShopTo's PlayStation gift cards, ranging between £10 and £200. While you'll be able to save at least 12% on each card, the degree of price drops varies to some degree.
Here are the other price cuts on each PSN gift card over at ShopTo:
You'll notice that when you click on one of the gift card's product pages, the full discount won't be unlocked right away. To get the full discount, you need to go to the checkout and enter the code ""SPRING"" into the coupon box to knock off an extra 5%.
After having a check through the rest of ShopTo, I've confirmed that the ""SPRING"" discount code is available for all of its products on the site until Sunday the 30th of January, including those on itsin-store game sale.
This means you can even get an extra discount onnew releases&pre-orders on upcoming gameslikeClair Obscur: Expedition 33,Assassin's Creed Shadows, andDeath Stranding 2: On the Beach. On top of what you've saved on those PlayStation gift card deals, you've certainly got a lot of bang for your buck.

"Here's an inexpensive alternative to swapping out AA batteries from your Xbox controller all the time. Amazon is offering atwo-pack of aftermarket rechargeable batteries for your Xbox controllerfor a mere $11.69 after you clip both coupons (20% off and 50% off) on the product page. That's just $5.85 per battery pack. As a comparison, the official MicorosoftPlay & Charge Kitwill run you $25, and that is for a single battery pack.

These rechargeable battery packs from ""6amLifestyle"" are compatible with both thecurrent generation Xbox Series X|S controllersand theolder Xbox One controllers. A nice feature of these battery packs is that they work with the stock USB port on the Xbox controller. Most other rechargeable packs have their own little port elsewhere that you need to use. A quality 10ft USB Type-C cable is included as well as a USB Type-C to Micro USB adapter for the legacy Xbox One controller. The cable is pretty cool because it has a little light that glows red when charging and blue when fully topped off.
6amLifestyle states that each battery pack can last up to 35 hours of continuous playtime and can charge from empty to full in about three hours. That's pretty similar to the Play & Charge Kit's claim of 30 hours of playtime and four-hour charge time, which makes sense since both packs have the same 1,400mAh capacity. Having two batteries also means you can immediately swap over to another pack when the first one is depleted, thus minimizing your downtime.

"The bigAmazon Spring Saleis still underway, and will be until the end of the day today, March 31. There are lots of toys and collectible deals forboard games,action figures,plushies, and evennerf guns. But most notably, (at least for me), some great LEGO sets are on sale, which is very uncommon, even during big-deal events like this one. Here are some the best LEGO deals I could find from Amazon's Spring sale.

LEGO retires old sets at same time that it debuts new ones, which pretty much guarantees that they can sell their inventory at full retail price. Add to this the recent price increases across LEGO's products, and your wallet is definitely getting a workout.
The standout of this deal roundup is the LEGO Mighty Bowser, which wereviewed at the time of its release. We consider it to be one of thebest LEGO sets ever designed, in the time since we began reviewing them six years ago.
Also worth noting is the Back to the Future Delorean Time Machine, which allows you tobuild all three versionsfrom the three respective films. Also don't miss out on the Optimus Prime, which actuallytransforms from vehicle to Autobotand back again.

"Nintendo has announced the Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a special game launching alongside the Switch 2 to take you on a guided tour of its new hardware. Surprisingly, though, it's not a pack-in piece of software, but a separate, paid digital game.

Shown during today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is a ""virtual exhibition"" of the new hardware. Per Nintendo, ""through tech demos, minigames and other interactions, players will get to know the new system inside and out in ways they may never have known about otherwise.""
Today's Direct showed footage of a small player avatar exploring a super-sized Switch 2, reading about the different features and facts about the Nintendo Switch 2. It seems to act like a virtual museum of sorts, but also have some min-games like Speed Golf, Dodge the Spiked Balls, and a Maracas Physics Demo.
On stream and in a press release, Nintendo also confirmed the Switch 2 Welcome Tour will be available to buy from the Nintendo eShop on Switch 2's launch day.
While it's a neat tool,fans were quick to wonder whythis was a paid digital-only game and not a console pack-in for the Nintendo Switch 2. No price has been listed as of this writing.
For comparison, the Switch 2 is also launching with games like Mario Kart World, Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster, and Deltarune Chapters 1 through 4. While a showcase for the new console is certainly intriguing, it will be competing for some stretched wallets early on.
The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025at a $449.99 USD price tag, or $499.99 for the bundle including Mario Kart World.
To catch up on everything announced during today's stream,be sure to check out our recap of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct right here.

Starting today, PlayStation Direct is offering two PS5 console bundles that include a digital download voucher wonderful Astro Bot game, whichwon the coveted Game of the Year at the Game Awards this year.

All PlayStation 5 consoles also come with Astro's Playroom, the original game/tech demo that kicked off our infatuation with the adorable robot.
Astro Bot Reviewby Simon Cardy
""Astro Bot made me smile from beginning to end. A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive. And while you don’t need a long history with Sony systems to enjoy it, it is especially a delight for those with a piece of PlayStation in their heart as a treasure trove full of playable nostalgia awaits. Taking the PS5 marketing mantra that “play has no limits” more seriously than you’d expect, Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it.""

It retails for $199 new, so that's a substantial 20% in savings. A Sony warranty may or may not be included, but Amazon Resale items benefit from the same 30-day return policy you get for buying a new item. We expect this item to sell out pretty quickly.
Lenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart.

"Finding a good deal on Apple products is rough, which is why I focused on all of these daily deals today. Finding multiple Apple deals, plus discounts on Zelda and Final Fantasy collectibles? It's my gamer-tech jackpot. Right now, you can save onAirPods Pro 2, grab aMagSafe leather case for just $11.99, and even score afour-pack of AirTags for under $70.

If you’re in the market forwireless earbuds,power adapters, or anApple Watchband, there are plenty of options at all-time low prices. And you know by now I like to pop in some really cool gaming stuff. How about a full-sizedMaster Sword replicathat plays Zelda music when you swing it and aFinal Fantasy I-VI bundlethat brings the pixel-perfect RPG classics back to life?
Upgrade your tech, complete your Zelda shrine, or relive Final Fantasy’s golden era, these deals are worth checking out. Some discounts like the iPhone 14 Plus MagSafe case, are downright ridiculous at 80% off. But Apple deals never last long (Tim Cook loves that Apple tax), and limited collectibles definitely sell out fast. If something catches your eye, now’s the time to add to cart before the price jumps back up.
AliExpress is offering this Arzopa 15"" 1080p USB Type-C portable monitor for only $57 shipped after you apply coupon code ""IFPQHLH"". We've posted deals on this portable monitor in the past, but this is the lowest price we've seen thus far. The marketplace vendor is Arzopa itself so you're getting the full manufacturer's warranty on this brand new, retail packaged item. This monitor is primarily designed to be a secondary display for a laptop, but the S1's 1080p 60Hz panel is a great match for the Nintendo Switch's hardware, since the Switch only supports up to 720p @ 60Hz anyway.
For only $22 more, you can upgrade to the higher end Arzopa Z1FC USB portable monitor, now only $79.19 after coupon code ""IFPQHLH"". It's currently $117 on Amazon. The Z1FC's upgrades include a larger display (16.1"" vs 15.6""), a higher refresh rate (144Hz vs. 60Hz), and better color reproduction (100% sRGB color gamut). This is a better monitor than the S1 to pair with the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally because both gaming handhelds can support refresh rates up to 144Hz.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.

If you’ve ever dreamed of wielding the Master Sword, this Tamashii Nations replica brings that dream to life. At 41.3 inches, it’s a full-sized, collector-worthy version of Link’s legendary blade. It’s not just for display either thanks to authentic sound effects and vibrations activate when you grip and swing it, making you feel like the true Hero of Hyrule.
The hilt features three buttons that play eight iconic songs from Zelda’s history, including themes from Ocarina of Time, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom. The sword comes with a sheath and display stand, so whether you want to show it off or take it into battle (against your furniture), it’s ready.

They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.

At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.
For those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it.

I'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.
If somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.
Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).
If you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, ""I really need to delete some games,"" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.

"The GeForce RTX 4090 is a generation older than the new Blackwell 50 series GPUs, but this doesn't change the fact that it's still one of the most powerful cards out there, eclipsing the GeForceRTX 5080orRTX 4080 Superor the RadeonRX 9070 XTorRX 7900 XTX. Only one GPU performs better - theRTX 5090- and you'll need to use up a lifetime of luck to find one that isn't marked up by hundreds, even thousands of dollars.

Because the RTX 4090 has been discontinued, it's getting harder to source as well. Fortunately, Dell still sells aAlienware Aurora R16gaming PC configuration that can be equipped with a 4090 GPU. Not only is it one of the few RTX 4090 prebuilts still available - Lenovo and HP no longer carry them - it's also one of the more reasonably priced ones.
ThisAlienware Aurora R16 gaming PCis equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F CPU, GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, 16GB of DDR5-5200MHz RAM, and a 1TB NVMe SSD. The processor can also be upgraded up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K. If you're getting system with a focus on gaming, then the upgrade is unnecessary. Gaming at higher resolutions is almost always GPU bound, and besides, the default Intel Core Ultra 7 265F is a solid processor with a max turbo frequency of 5.3GHz and a total of 20 cores. It's cooled by a robust 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler and the entire system is powered by an 1,000W 80PLUS Platinum power supply.
Dell just dropped the price on this upgraded RTX 4090 model to $3,599.99 after a $400 instant discount. It's $600 more than the base model Alienware 4090 gaming PC, but that's because the processor has been upgraded to a much more powerful Intel Core i9-14900KF CPU. You also get quadruple the RAM and double the storage.
The RTX 4090 is themost powerful RTX 40 series GPUon the market. Compared to the new Blackwell cards, only the $2,000 MSRP RTX 5090 is superior in performance. This card will run every game comfortably at 4K resolution; you should be hitting 60+fps even with all settings turned to the max and ray tracing enabled, doubly so if DLSS is supported. The only setting that the 4090 (as well as every other GPU) struggles with is path tracing, but no one really ever turns this on except during benchmark tests or social media flexing. The RTX 5090 might be faster, but for the vast majority of people out there, it's just wasted power since the 4090 already excels at pretty much all things gaming.
Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU Reviewby Chris Coke
""The RTX 4090 may be huge and expensive, but holy smokes if it doesn’t blow the competition out of the water. That’s a little unfair because it’s currently the only card of this new generation that’s available, so we only have cards from the past few years to compare it to. But until the rest of the pack can catch up, between its impressive hardware specs and its DLSS 3 AI wizardry, even the $1,599 price doesn’t seem unreasonable for the unrivaled frame rates that this card can crank out.""
Dell is offering anAlienware Aurora R16 gaming PCequipped with the new GeForce RTX 5080 GPU for $2,499.99 shipped. The RTX 5080 is one of three new Blackwell graphics cards that are out (and impossible to find). In ourNvidia GeForce RTX 5080 FE review, Jackie writes that ""If you already have a high-end graphics card from the last couple of years, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 doesn’t make a lot of sense – it just doesn’t have much of a performance lead over the RTX 4080, though the extra frames from DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation do make things look better in games that support it. However, for gamers with an older graphics card who want a significant performance boost, the RTX 5080 absolutely provides – doubly so if you’re comfortable with Nvidia’s AI goodies.""

"LG's most popular current generation OLED TV has been discounted starting today. Right now Amazon has dropped the price of the65"" LG Evo C4 4K OLED TVto $1,396.99. The LG Evo C-series of TVs - including this model - have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVsfor HDR movie watching and current generation console gaming.

The C4 is the 2024 model in LG's C-series OLED lineup. The LG Evo C5 hasn't yet been released, butit was showcased during CES 2025. At least on paper, the improvements of the C5 seem to be incremental, with no major ground breaking updates that would make you want to hold off until its launch. More importantly, the C5 will probably release at a very high retail price which will take months to get down to a level that's competitive with other TV deals.
The C4 uses LG's Evo panel, which offers higher brightness levels than traditional OLED TVs. Compared to a standard LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. Because of these advantages, the Evo OLED TV excels at displaying 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations.
The LG C4 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz and all four HDMI ports are 2.1 spec for running games in 4K at up to 120fps on a PS5 or Xbox Series X without any tearing. The C4 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM). The C4 is also easier to install than its predecessors; the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that weighs 36 pounds.
The LG Evo C-series TV is ourfavorite high-end 4K TV of 2025because of the brilliance of its OLED display along with a host of quality features that don't quite push it to the point of an excessively high price. This model brings better contrast and clarity than the previous year's already luminous LG C2. It’s a sight to behold, especially when you add in the deep blacks and well-balanced colors on the crisp 4K screen. Once you choose OLED, it's hard to go back to anything else.
If you bought a brand new TV over the holidays and you're looking for a good audio solution at an excellent price, then one of the best Black Friday deals is back. Walmart is currently offering theBose Smart Soundbar 550for just $199 with free shipping after a massive $300 off instant discount. At this price, it's certainly one of the best soundbars you can get, especially if you're looking for an affordable soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos.
If you don't mind going a generation back, you can pick up a 202365"" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TVfor just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday. The 2024 C4 has minimal incremental upgrades over the 2023 C3, with the most noticeable improvements being an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, support for DTS audio, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate.
If you prefer Sony as your TV brand, then Best Buy has some great deals for this week. The Sony Bravia XR A75L 4K OLED smart TVs are on sale right now with the 55"" model priced at $999.99 and the 65"" model for $1,299.99. Although the A75L is an older generation (2023) TV, it's still one of the best TVs out there in terms of image quality and gaming performance. Especially for the 55"" model, you won't find a better TV for under $1,000.

"The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card was released in late February for $749.99, but good luck finding one at that price. As with the rest of the Blackwell lineup, everyone from personal sellers to themanufacturers themselveshave joined in on theprice markup bonanza. Fortunately there's a way to get around these shenanigans, and that is by purchasing a prebuilt gaming PC instead. Amazon is currently offering CyberPowerPC and Skytech RTX 5070 Ti gaming desktops starting at $2,099.99. That's a reasonable price considering the fact that theRTX 5070 Ti has proven to be nearly identical in performance (within 5%) to the RTX 4080 Super.

Of all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and already marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled. Heck, even if you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti might be the better value than the RTX 50870 since both are equipped with the same 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM.
Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas
""At $749, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is the best 4K graphics card for most people, delivering much better value than either the RTX 5080 or 5090. Across my entire test suite, this GPU soared at 4K, coming within striking distance of much more expensive graphics cards, and that’s before taking multi frame generation into account, which will make the RTX 5070 Ti even better at hitting extremely high framerates, albeit with a hit to latency.""
Amazon has the best deal right now on an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT prebuilt. You can pick up the  for $1,799.99. That's a great price for a newly released GPU that stands toe to toe with an RTX 5070 Ti (or RTX 4080) for about $300 less than the least expensive RTX 5070 Ti prebuilt listed above.

"ThePlayStation Portalhas never been discounted, but at least you can save on a used one.Amazon Resale(a rebranded Amazon Warehouse) currently has Used: Like New condition PS Portals in stock for only $150.23 shipped. It retails for $199 new, so that's a substantial 25% in savings. A Sony warranty may or may not be included, but Amazon Resale items benefit from the same 30-day return policy you get for buying a new item. We expect this item to sell out pretty quickly.

Update:Price has dropped to $150.23, the lowest we've seen for a Used: Like New unit.
Make sure to select the ""Save with Used - Like New"" option (scroll down a bit)
Used: Like New Condition
Looks and functions as if it were new. Moderate packing damage observed during inspection.
The PS Portal, Sony's handheld gaming accessory for the PS5 console, looks very much like an extended split-pad DualSense controller with an 8-inch 1080p LCD screen in the middle of it. It turns your PS5 into a gaming handheld by letting you stream games from your console at up to 60fps. The controller mirrors the same features found on the DualSense, including haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and a touchscreen interface that replaces the Dualsense's touchpad. The Portal can stream your games even when you're outside of your home, with the caveat that you have access tovery stable, very fastinternet connection. Keep in mind that the PS Portal is not a standalone device. This is strictly a remote player for the PlayStation 5, so you will need a PS5 to use it.
Update:You no longer need a PS5 to play games on the PS Portal. Now, rather than being limited to simply streaming games from a $500 console to a $200 handheld, Sony has introduced a feature that lets owners stream games directly from its PlayStation Now cloud streaming service. No PS5 required. Portal owners now have the option to either connect the Portal to their PS5 as before, or directly to Sony’s cloud servers. Choose the latter and suddenly you have access to a library of more than 120 games, including Ghost of Tsushima, Resident Evil 3 Remake, The Last of Us Part 1 Remastered, and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.It’s worth noting you must be a subscriber to the highest tier of PlayStation Plus, but $18 a month is much more attractive that splashing out $500 upfront plus an extra $70 a game.
It should be said that the PlayStation Portal isn’t the only way to stream your PS5 games over Wi-Fi within your home. You can mimic its functionality by downloading the PS Remote Play app on a mobile device, including other gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck.  That said, it's more complicated to set up and you'll lose out on some of the Dualsense's features.
PlayStation Portal Reviewby Seth Macy
""The PlayStation Portal is the most surprising device I've ever come away from loving after going in loaded with skepticism. It's such a better experience than using your phone with a slap-on controller, and it works so much better than I was anticipating. I really love the freedom it gives me to play my PS5 from anywhere with decent WiFi coverage, especially when the rest of my family was using the TV to (somewhat ironically) play the Switch. Bearing in mind that it’s in no way a stand-alone device and 100% requires a PlayStation 5 to function at all, the biggest things keeping the Portal from being a truly amazing device are its current lack of a way to access WiFi that requires a web browser to log in, and its lack of Bluetooth support for audio. For now, it's a great device that represents the best current solution for PlayStation Remote Play, and if it weren't for those two baffling caveats, I'd call this a must-own device for every PS5 owner who enjoys playing games on handheld – or has to compete for the household TV.""
Lenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.

"If you're thinking of jumping on the AMD bandwagon for your next upgrade, now is certainly the right time to do so. Alongside theRyzen 7 9800X3Dwhich debuted earlier this year, AMD has just released its two higher-end Ryzen 9 siblings in the Zen 5 ""X3D"" stack: the9950X3Dis available for $699 and the9900X3Dis available for $599. Collectively, these processors represent thebest gaming chipsacross both Intel and AMD. Pure gamers should go with the 9800X3D and allocate their funds elsewhere; creators with deeper pockets and a penchant for gaming will benefit from the immense performance uplift on the new Ryzen 9 processors thanks to their increased core count and cache.

Note: Processors are going in and out of stock (mostly out of stock, unfortunately).
Creative professionals who also want the best gaming chip on the market shouldn't think twice; this is the CPU to get. The new 9950X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.7GHz with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 144MB of L2-L3 cache. In terms of gaming, it's only a few percentage points better than than the 9800X3D. However, for productivity use, it easily outperforms the other two Zen 5 X3D chips, and anything offered by Intel for that matter.
AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas
""The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D might be the most powerful gaming processor on the market right now, but that doesn’t mean it has a de facto lead on every other chip on the market. Most people will have no problem getting by with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which just so happens to be much much more affordable at $479. Instead, the 9950X3D is geared towards gamers that both play games and use creative apps like Photoshop and Premiere, the latter of which sees a 15% performance improvement over the 9800X3D. For a pure gaming PC build, though, you’re probably better off saving that extra $220 for a better graphics card.""
AMD's X3D series processors are gaming optimized thanks to AMD's 3D V-Cache technology. However, since all three CPUs have the 3D V-cache loaded onto a single CCD, you get roughly the same gaming performance across all three chips. The minor differences are mostly due to the difference in clock speed. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.2GHz with 8 cores, 16 threads, and 104MB of L2-L3 cache Although perfectly capable of handling multitasking, rendering, and creation, the limited number of cores means they aren't the ideal processors for those tasks. However, this is an absolute monster of a processor for gaming, especially at this price point.
""The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is extremely powerful in games, which makes it easier to recommend than other recent processors like the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K or Ryzen 9 9900X. Especially if you’re building a rig with a powerful graphics card, the 9800X3D is going to be the best way to get the most performance out of whichever GPU you pair it with.""
The AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D is the processor you'd get if you do creative work and like to game, but you have a budget to adhere to and the 9950X3D crosses that line. The new 9900X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.5GHz with 12 cores, 24 threads, and 140MB of L2-L3 cache. This is the one chip we haven't reviewed yet, but from the specs, it's pretty easy to guess its performance. In terms of productivity tasks and multi-core workloads, it should perform somewhere in between the 9950X3D and 9800X3D. In terms of gaming, we expect it to be a wash compared to the other two.
If you decided to hold off onNvidia's Blackwell GPUs to see if AMD's new offeringswere up to snuff, then you made the right choice. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards are the new mid-range champions of this generation. Both cards offer phenomenal performance while undercutting their Nvidia competition in price. The Radeon RX 9070 starts at $550 and the 9070 XT starts at $600 (although it turns out that manufacturers are hiking the price again).

"The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card was released in late February for $749.99, but good luck finding one at that price. As with the rest of the Blackwell lineup, everyone from personal sellers to themanufacturers themselveshave joined in on theprice markup bonanza. Fortunately there's a way to get around these shenanigans, and that is by purchasing a prebuilt gaming PC instead. Amazon is currently offering CyberPowerPC and Skytech RTX 5070 Ti gaming desktops starting at $2,099.99. That's a reasonable price considering the fact that theRTX 5070 Ti has proven to be nearly identical in performance (within 5%) to the RTX 4080 Super.

Of all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and already marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled. Heck, even if you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti might be the better value than the RTX 50870 since both are equipped with the same 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM.
Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas
""At $749, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is the best 4K graphics card for most people, delivering much better value than either the RTX 5080 or 5090. Across my entire test suite, this GPU soared at 4K, coming within striking distance of much more expensive graphics cards, and that’s before taking multi frame generation into account, which will make the RTX 5070 Ti even better at hitting extremely high framerates, albeit with a hit to latency.""
Amazon has the best deal right now on an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT prebuilt. You can pick up the  for $1,799.99. That's a great price for a newly released GPU that stands toe to toe with an RTX 5070 Ti (or RTX 4080) for about $300 less than the least expensive RTX 5070 Ti prebuilt listed above.

"The GeForce RTX 4090 is a generation older than the new Blackwell 50 series GPUs, but this doesn't change the fact that it's still one of the most powerful cards out there, eclipsing the GeForceRTX 5080orRTX 4080 Superor the RadeonRX 9070 XTorRX 7900 XTX. Only one GPU performs better - theRTX 5090- and you'll need to use up a lifetime of luck to find one that isn't marked up by hundreds, even thousands of dollars.

Because the RTX 4090 has been discontinued, it's getting harder to source as well. Fortunately, Dell still sells aAlienware Aurora R16gaming PC configuration that can be equipped with a 4090 GPU. Not only is it one of the few RTX 4090 prebuilts still available - Lenovo and HP no longer carry them - it's also one of the more reasonably priced ones.
ThisAlienware Aurora R16 gaming PCis equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F CPU, GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, 16GB of DDR5-5200MHz RAM, and a 1TB NVMe SSD. The processor can also be upgraded up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K. If you're getting system with a focus on gaming, then the upgrade is unnecessary. Gaming at higher resolutions is almost always GPU bound, and besides, the default Intel Core Ultra 7 265F is a solid processor with a max turbo frequency of 5.3GHz and a total of 20 cores. It's cooled by a robust 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler and the entire system is powered by an 1,000W 80PLUS Platinum power supply.
Dell just dropped the price on this upgraded RTX 4090 model to $3,599.99 after a $400 instant discount. It's $600 more than the base model Alienware 4090 gaming PC, but that's because the processor has been upgraded to a much more powerful Intel Core i9-14900KF CPU. You also get quadruple the RAM and double the storage.
The RTX 4090 is themost powerful RTX 40 series GPUon the market. Compared to the new Blackwell cards, only the $2,000 MSRP RTX 5090 is superior in performance. This card will run every game comfortably at 4K resolution; you should be hitting 60+fps even with all settings turned to the max and ray tracing enabled, doubly so if DLSS is supported. The only setting that the 4090 (as well as every other GPU) struggles with is path tracing, but no one really ever turns this on except during benchmark tests or social media flexing. The RTX 5090 might be faster, but for the vast majority of people out there, it's just wasted power since the 4090 already excels at pretty much all things gaming.
Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU Reviewby Chris Coke
""The RTX 4090 may be huge and expensive, but holy smokes if it doesn’t blow the competition out of the water. That’s a little unfair because it’s currently the only card of this new generation that’s available, so we only have cards from the past few years to compare it to. But until the rest of the pack can catch up, between its impressive hardware specs and its DLSS 3 AI wizardry, even the $1,599 price doesn’t seem unreasonable for the unrivaled frame rates that this card can crank out.""
Dell is offering anAlienware Aurora R16 gaming PCequipped with the new GeForce RTX 5080 GPU for $2,499.99 shipped. The RTX 5080 is one of three new Blackwell graphics cards that are out (and impossible to find). In ourNvidia GeForce RTX 5080 FE review, Jackie writes that ""If you already have a high-end graphics card from the last couple of years, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 doesn’t make a lot of sense – it just doesn’t have much of a performance lead over the RTX 4080, though the extra frames from DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation do make things look better in games that support it. However, for gamers with an older graphics card who want a significant performance boost, the RTX 5080 absolutely provides – doubly so if you’re comfortable with Nvidia’s AI goodies.""

"If you're in the market for a new PlayStation or Xbox console and bottom-line pricing is your utmost priority, check out these deals from AliExpress. You can get a brand new importedXbox Series XandPlayStation 5consoles for much lower than you can find a new model elsewhere. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming consoles that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by your account, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item. These consoles all ship locally from the United States and usually arrive within one week.

AliExpress as a whole is a legitimate website, but since it is a marketplace comprised of individual sellers, you have to make sure that the vendor you're buying from is reputable. In many cases, the easiest way to do so is to look at the seller's rating and history. In terms of the products we've listed in this article, while it's true that some of the sellers may not have many reviews,AliExpress has reached out to us and personally vetted these vendors, which is why we feel comfortable promoting them. AliExpress also offers a 15 to 90 day free return policy depending on the product.
AliExpress has dropped the price of the professional-grade Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Controller to only $74.42 shipped after you apply coupon code ""IFP3TXY""in cart. That's a huge price drop from its normal $140 list price and nearly the same cost as a standard Xbox controller. Note that this is a Hong Kong or Japanese import model in new retail packaging, but you won't find it cheaper anywhere else. Aside from the different color scheme, the Core controller is identical to the Xbox Elite Series 2 non-Core controller. The Core controller, however, does not include the component pack. AliExpress offers a 90-day return policy.
AliExpress also just dropped the price on a new retail boxed (imported) Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 wireless gaming controller – component pack included – to $100 shipped. This controller retails for $180 and the lowest price we've ever seen for this controller stateside is about $130-$140.
Lenovo has dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart. Lenovo might not be the first site you'd think of for great deals on PlayStation controllers, but surprisingly, no one can match their pricing. This might be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, at least untilSony's PlayStation Days of Play Salethat will probably happen sometime in late May.
SteelSeries is currently offering theArctis Nova 7 Dragon Editiongaming headset for only $119.99 after an $80 off instant discount. The Dragon Edition is identical to the Nova Arctis 7 in build quality and performance, but with the addition of a deep red colorway with decorative gold dragon accents in celebration of 2024's Year of the Dragon motif. Even though 2024 has passed, this is still one of SteelSeries' classier designs that doesn't feel outdated or out of place.
SteelSeries is also taking 35% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets. The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Destiny 2 in-game items.

"Razer's new 2025 lineup of gaming laptops are now up for preorder. TheRazer Blade 16andRazer Blade 18can now be ordered directly from Razer.com and will be equipped with the upcoming Intel and Ryzen processors (depending on which display size you get) as well as the anticipated RTX 5000-series mobile GPUs in three variants: RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080, and RTX 5090. Preordering will also get you some bonus accessories depending on the model.

Razer Blade laptops are well known for their impeccable build quality. The chassis is built from a single piece of aluminum and is designed to be exceptionally thin and light for a gaming laptop. In order to get away with the svelte form factor, Razer employs its own proprietary cooling design which incorporates a vacuum sealed, liquid filled, copper vapor chamber to effectively whisk away the heat. Much like Apple MacBook Pros, a lot of engineering goes into a Razer Blade laptop, which is why they command a premium price compared to other mainstream brands.
The Razer Blade 18 is an Intel-based system and the base config is equipped with the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, which is a more performance-minded chip compared to the current Core Ultra 9 185H, which focuses on efficiency. The rest of the specs include an 18"" Dual UHD+ 240Hz display (which can natively switch to FHD+ 440Hz), RTX 5070 Ti graphics, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $3,499.99. You can upgrade to either the RTX 5080 or the RTX 5090.
Preordering the Razer Blade 16 will also get you an X-Ray Razer laptop skin and a USB-C dock.
The Razer Blade 16 is a Ryzen system and the base config is equipped with an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU. The rest of the specs include a 16"" 240Hz QHD+ OLED display, RTX 5070 Ti graphics, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $2,999.99. The processor can be upgraded to a Ryzen AI 9 370HX, and the GPU can be upgraded to either the RTX 5080 or  RTX 5090.
Preordering the Razer Blade 18 will get youan X-Ray Razer laptop skin and RGB laptop stand.
Razer has listed an expected ship date ofApril 30on the product pages.
Our benchmarks are in, and it looks like the RTX 5090 is indeed the new king of mobile GPUs, although not by the leaps and bounds we were hoping for. On average, the RTX 5090 is about 5%-10% more powerful than the RTX 4090 that it replaces. However, add in DLSS 4 and the gap widens.
RTX 5090 Mobile Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas
""If you already have a decent gaming laptop, you really shouldn’t look at the RTX 5090 twice. It doesn’t deliver much of an improvement over its last-generation counterpart, which remains excellent. However, if you’ve been waiting to upgrade to a high-end gaming laptop for a while, features like multi-frame generation and battery boost will make premium laptops powered by Nvidia’s latest even better.""
Dell announced the return of the venerable Alienware Area-51 gaming laptop back in CES 2025, and starting today it is finally available to order. It comes in two size variants: the16"" model starts at $3,199.99and the18"" model starts at $3,399.99. As expected from Alienware's new flagship laptop, the Area-51 is equipped with current generation components, including the latest and greatest Intel Core Ultra 9 CPU and NVIDIA Blackwell GPU. Orders are expected to ship out starting April 30, so get your reservation in now to prevent any additional delays.

"Looking for the least expensive PlayStation 5 console you can your hands on? As part of its US Anniversary Sale, AliExpress is offering an importedSony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Editiongaming console for $383.71 shipped after $80 off coupon code ""MAYUE008"". Alternatively, you can get theDigital Editionfor $353.05.

"If you're in the market for a PS5 in 2025, thePlayStation 5 Slim Astro Bot bundleis one of the best deals available. Right now, the Disc model is $449.99 atAmazonwhile the Digital model is $399.99 atAmazon. Both models are also available at other retailers (see below).

What makes this bundle stand out is that Astro Bot is included at no extra cost—effectively a free $70 game packed in with your console. If you needed an extra incentive to grab a PS5, this is it. Astro Bot isn’t just a throw-in; it was one of the best games of 2024, taking homeBest Game at The Game Awardsand cementing itself as a must-play for platforming fans.
If you want to be able to play games on disc, this is the one to get.
If you're cool with embracing the all-digital future, get this one. (You can buy a disc drive later if you change your mind).
Reviewing for IGN, Simon Cardy gave Astro Bot a 9, praising it as one of the most joyful experiences in gaming: ""Astro Bot made me smile from beginning to end. A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive. And while you don’t need a long history with Sony systems to enjoy it, it is especially a delight for those with a piece of PlayStation in their heart as a treasure trove full of playable nostalgia awaits.""
""Taking the PS5 marketing mantra that 'play has no limits' more seriously than you’d expect, Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it.""
For those still on the fence about buying aPS5, this bundle makes for a compelling argument, and it's certainly one of thebest PS5 dealsgoing right now. Astro Bot isn’t just a great game—it’s a celebration of everything PlayStation does best, making it an ideal showcase for Sony’s current gen hardware.

Unlike most power banks, it features a built-in USB cable that tucks into itself to form a secure loop, doubling as a handy carrying strap. A digital display shows the exact battery percentage, so you’re never left guessing how much charge is left.
This power bank is alsoTSA-compliant for carry-on luggage, staying well below the 27,000mAh limit. Since power banks aren’t allowed in checked bags, it’s ideal for flights, keeping your devices powered up without hassle.

"For a limited time, Target is offering an outstanding deal on one of thebest noise cancelling headphones. Right now you can get a pair ofSony WH-1000XM4noise cancelling wireless headphones for just $179.99 after you clip a 50% off Target Circle coupon (membership is free). This is the lowest price we've seen for this particular model and beats out last year's Black Friday price by $20. Sony's headphones are considered by many to be the best noise cancelling headphones out there, beating out stiff competition from other popular brands like Bose and Beats.

The Sony WH-1000XM4 isn't the newest model in its series - it's one generation behind theWH-1000XM5- but headphone technology moves at a snail's pace. Even 5 years after its original launch, the WH-1000XM4 is still an excellent headphone that performs favorably compared to newer heavy hitters. It offers great sound quality, effective active noise cancellation, and comfortable ergonomics (arguably more comfortable than the WH-1000XM5). It features USB Type-C charging with up to 30 hours of battery life, Bluetooth Multipoint for simultaneous pairing with up to two devices, and a compact profile thanks to its foldable, swiveling design. You'd be hard pressed to find a better headphone under $200.
If you want the current generation of Sony's headphones, then AliExpress is offering the imported Sony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphones for only $225.18 after coupon code ""IFP7FJZ"" is applied..  This product is stocked in a US warehouse, so it ships free and arrives within 1-2 weeks. Imported models are brand new and retail packaged, however they carry an overseas warranty that won't be honored in the United States. AliExpress makes up for it with a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days. Improvements over the WH-1000XM4 include better noise cancellation, better passive isolation, and sleeker aesthetics
Sony WH1000XM5 Reviewby Kevin Lee
""The Sony WH-1000XM5 is the big upgrade we’ve been waiting for from Sony’s flagship wireless headphones. The new design and AI makes the noise-canceling stronger while the ambient listening mode is splendidly natural. Audio quality is impeccable too – whether you want to listen to intricate classical music or a rocking action movie, these headphones can do it all.""

"Amazon is really jacking up the gaming deals in theirSpring Deal Days sale, giving you the limited-time chance to buy a new wirelessXbox controller from just £35.99. While some of the other selections are £4.50 more, the whole selection of colours available for these Series X|S controllers has had a price reduction, so you're getting at least 33% off whichever one you like most.

As a second or spare controller for your Xbox Series X or S console, along with supported games on PC, all those on sale at Amazon right now include the following colours:
Although the standard Carbon Black and Robot White—those bundled with the Xbox Series X & S consoles respectively—have been reduced to the lowest price of £35.99, all of the alternative colors have been dropped to a slightly higher yet still impressive £40.49. If you're in need of a new controller to play the newest games, likeCall of Duty: Black Ops 6which is on sale now as well, this is a fantastic opportunity.
You have to flaunt Amazon a little bit more of your cash to add a splash of style to your setup with one of these vivid color schemes likeAstral Purple, but it does seem worth it. What's more, these other models include the controller's updated design, featuring the X, A, B, and Y buttons being switched from their respective blue, green, red, and yellow colours to match that of their controllers' body.
The original button colours are still shown as tiny dots next to each one, but this update overall gives the controllers a more modest, sleeker appeal that arguably justifies the slightly larger price investment.
For those after a controller with a design that boasts more than one solid colour, Amazon UK also has the Special Fire Vapor Edition of the Xbox Series X|S controller as well,reduced by 20% to £51.99. Featuring titular vapor-like red-and-orange swirls, this bold colour scheme will invoke a little extra energy into your console setup if that's what you're looking for.

"Amazon has the best deal right now on an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT prebuilt. You can pick up theSkytech Blaze4 RX 9070 XT gaming PCfor only $1,599.99 after a new $100 instant discount. That's a great price for a newly released GPU that stands toe to toe with an RTX 5070 Ti (or RTX 4080), which could easily run you well over $2,000 in this absurd market.

This Skytech gaming PC is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 7700 processor, Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU, 16GB of DDR5  RAM, and 1TB M.2 SSD. This is a pretty nicely thought out configuration, with a competent AMD processor and DDR5 RAM with an optimal DDR5-6000MHz speed rating. The AMD Ryzen 7 7700 features a max boost clock speed of 5.3GHz with 8 cores, 16 threads, and a 32MB L2 cache. You won't see much of a gaming performance uplift if you were to go for a newer Ryzen 7 or even a Ryzen 9 processor, especially at higher resolutions. Going by the photos, a 360mm aio liquid cooling system keeps CPU temps down. The entire system is powered by a generous 850W 80PLUS Gold power supply.
We rated the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT a ""perfect"" 10/10. Even though it costs $150 less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the 9070 XT beats it out in several of the games we tested. In a few benchmarks, the results aren't even close. The 9070 XT also has 16GB of VRAM, the same as the 9070 and 5070 Ti.
AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Reviewby Jacqueline Thomas
""PC Gaming has been in a decadent spiral since 2020, and the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is a reminder that it doesn’t have to be that way. This graphics card has no problem maxing out any game you throw at it at 4K, even with ray tracing enabled, and does so at a price that makes the competition look downright greedy. I can’t predict the future, so only time will tell if the launch price holds up. What I do know is we need more graphics cards like the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT.""

"While gaming has moved forward with bigger and more powerful consoles, theAtari 2600 Plusoffers a way to revisit the era of classic cartridge gaming. Right now, it'savailable for £50.13—half its usual price of £99.99—at its exclusive UK retailer, Amazon.

Released in November 2023, theAtari 2600 Plusmodernizes the original console’s design while maintaining compatibility with both Atari 2600 and 7800 cartridges. It connects easily to modern TVs via HDMI and includes a widescreen mode to better fit contemporary screens.
If you still have old cartridges like Space Invaders or Asteroids, they’ll run just as you remember. The system also comes with a CX40+ Joystick Controller, faithfully recreating the original’s design, along with a 10-in-1 cartridge featuring titles like Combat, Missile Command, and Yars’ Revenge:
For those looking to expand their collection, a second joystick is available separately for multiplayer games, and the 4-in-1 Game Cartridge Plus Paddle Pack adds titles like Breakout and Night Driver.
With its mix of nostalgia and modern convenience, the Atari 2600 Plus makes it easy to revisit classic games. And with this price drop, it’s a good time to pick one up.
In ourAtati 2600 Plus review, IGN's Seth Macy had this to say: ""Every time I walk past the Atari 2600+ sitting on the floor of my living room, controllers and games scattered around it, I'm instantly transported to the 1980s. Everything about its design is painstakingly authentic to the original while making necessary updates to bring it into the modern era. Atari collecting is easier than newer systems, but playing those carts has always been a bit tough since the original hardware was designed for an era when few TVs had coax inputs, much less composite video.""
""Being able to output to HDMI makes playing your original carts a snap, although seeing Combat on a 65"" 4K screen doesn't really add anything to the experience. The Atari 2600+ is a fantastic upgrade to the original hardware that stays faithful to the original where it counts the most. Part of me wishes it had wireless controllers, but the other part of me knows that would take away from the experience I remember as a little kid in front of a 13"" black & white tube television. And ultimately, the Atari 2600+ is about taking you back.""

"Amazon is hosting aBig Spring Salethis week (March 25-31), with deals on selectbooks,Blu-rays, toys, and more. Sure, some toys are meant for kids, but when it comes toNerf guns, LEGO (like theLEGO Wednesday Set) and beloved character plushies, I think anyone can enjoy these cozy collectibles.

I've rounded up the best deals I could find across popular franchises and characters, includingPokémon, TMNT, Disney, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and beyond. Whether you're buying for yourself or want to gift to a loved one, these cute plushies are affordable, adorable, and worth checking out.
One of the most popular plushie types sold these days is reversible plushies, giving you two sides of a character. It's essentially a two-in-one collectible, allowing you to switch up the expression you want to display based on your own mood on any given day. The TeeTurtle brand is one of the most common brands offering reviersible plushies, which is found above from Avatar: The Last Airbender, TMNT, and the Axolotl stuffed animals.
A personal favorite of mine is theInside Out 2 Embarrassed Character plush. I love the Inside Out movies and characters, and I appreciate the fact the plush is weighted for extra comfort and anxiety relief. Plus, it's only $14.40. In fact, most of these picks are below $15 with the exception of Kirby and Grogu!
TheSquishmallows Storeis loaded with fan-favorites right now on Amazon. There are select 10-inch Harry Potter plushies on sale, a cute lava lamp plush, a huggable Iron Man plush, and more squishy pals you can collect below during the Big Spring Sale.
AsPokémon toysremain popular, it's rare to see big Pokémon plushie deals on the most popular characters. That said, depending on the size and type you're seeking to find, there actually are some on sale this week, so don't miss out!
While Amazon is one of the more convenient places to shop, it isn't the only place where you canbuy popular plushies. Two of the best alternatives to Amazon are Target and Walmart, which will often have inventory when Amazon runs out. These two retailers also usually have more 20-inch versions in stock as well. For Pokémon fans specifically, you can also findPokémon SquishmallowsfromPokemon Center.

"Currys has been a regular for unexpected price reductions and discounts in the UK gaming scene, and now its10% discount on Nintendo eShop gift cardsis another delightful surprise. If you were planning on spending some cash, depending on what gets revealed at theNintendo Switch 2 directon Wednesday, the 2nd of April, it seems like Currys wants to have your back.

This isn't just for one digital gift card either, Currys made it so the whole range of Nintendo eShop credit—in the amounts of£15,£25,£50,£75,£100—can have 10% knocked off at checkout when you used the promo code, ""NINTENDODIGITAL10"".
This means that you can receive a discount as big as £10 when buying the £100 card, only spending £90 altogether. Then, you'll have that £10 in extra value on games and subscriptions when spending on the Nintendo eShop.
For those who have never redeemed a gift card on their Nintendo Switch before, you just need to carry out the following steps once the download key you'll get has been added to your online Currys account:
There won't be any deadlines for which you need to use the code. So, if you want to save your boosted eShop credit to eventually spend on the upcomingMario Kart 9orPokémon Legends Z-A, you are more than free to do so.
Suppose you have more than one gamer in the family and have been thinking about adding an extra Nintendo Switch to the household. In that case, Currys is also offering10% off console accessories & softwarewhen you buy one of their Nintendo Switch consoles.
That includes the original Neon Red & Blue Switch, the While OLED Switch, and the Nintendo Switch Lite—all being great first consoles for your little one or significant other at home.

"GameCube games coming exclusively to the Switch 2'sexclusive online library is one of the best features of the new console. To make those membership costs just that little bit easier, UK retailerShopTohas NSO at 35% off right now, and there's an extra 5% when you use code SPRING at checkout. As you get yourNintendo Switch 2 preordersin, this is an absolute bonus bargain to consider.

While some Nintendo Classics catalogues are unlocked with the base online subscription, you'll also need the Expansion Pack to play GameCube titles on Nintendo Switch 2. What's more, while you can subscribe to a monthly model for just Nintendo Switch Online, the Expansion Pack is only available on the 12-month plan, so make a note when purchasing.
Currently, the individual versions of these combined 12-month subscriptions cost either £34.99 on the Nintendo eShop or £39.99 at retailers like ShopTo. But now, it seems like ShopTo are keen to get on the Switch 2 hype by slashing £14.14 off the individual plan and £15.14 off the family plans respectively.
So, if you're the only Nintendo Switch players in your household, you can buy theindividual Online + Expansion Pack plan for £24.55or theFamily Membership for £43.55with the promo code SPRING.
Overall, the family version is fantastic value as you can have up to eight Nintendo Accounts under a Family Group sharing the same membership, and you don't have to be in the same household either.
Under ShopTo's new price, that's as low as £5.60 per person getting to enjoy Nintendo Switch Online and the entire Expansion Pack's catalogue of games—including GameCube gemsPokemon XD: Gale of Darkness,Soulcalibur 2, andThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker— for a whole year.
If you're like me, though, and have already have a basic Nintendo Switch Online membership active until next year, the only way to upgrade is through Nintendo themselves—either on their website or the eShop—without a direct discount from retailers like ShopTo.
However, a way to get around that is by purchasingdiscounted digital Nintendo eShop gift cards from Currys. Buy entering the code ""NINTENDODIGITAL10"" at checkout, you'll get 10% off on£15,£25,£50,£75, and£100amounts of eShop credit—saving you as much as £10.
In the case of upgrading your 12-month Nintendo Switch Online membership, the cost of which varies depending on how much is left, you can buy the closest amount you need or a larger amount at a bigger discount, and use any extra credit you have on digital games or save it to put toward your subscription next year.

"We live in an era of getting things shipped straight to your home, without needing to leave your house. Pretty much anything I could ever want can be sent directly to me in seemingly no time flat. It's an incredible thing, and yet part of me still yearns for the experience of getting something in person. It feels like it's more of an actual event and a memory you'll have forever.

With theNintendo Switch 2 preordersstarting soon, Best Buyhas announcedthat customers will have the option to pick up the new console at their local store at the stroke of midnight EST. It's the earliest possible time fans can get their hands on the Switch 2, withWalmart offering free deliveriesbefore 9 a.m. on June 5. While having it shipped directly to me would be the easiest path, the idea of actually going somewhere to secure the console with my own two hands appeals to me a lot more. If I do end up getting a preorder for the Switch 2, I'm going to choose to wait in line and make a big deal out of it.
Editor's Note: Due to tariffs in the U.S.,Switch 2 preorders have been delayedat Best Buy.
Best Buy preorders for the Switch 2 console, Switch 2 games, and its accessoriesbegin on Wednesday, April 9. If you're able to secure a console before stock disappears, you'll be able to choose preorder pickup at your local Best Buy location. You cansign up to get notificationsdirectly from Best Buy about all things Switch 2. Best Buy stated that most stores will be open at midnight ET on launch day— June 5— for pickup.
You can always use Google Maps to find your local Best Buy, but you can also use the tech retailer'sstore locater pageto find all locations in your surrounding area. You can widen the range of your search by simply expanding the map and see if the closest store is actually worth the drive.
In case you aren't familiar with Best Buy's memberships, there are a total of three. There's the free My Best Buy membership (which you'll need to preorder), My Best Buy Plus, and My Best Buy Total. Only the Plus and Total memberships are offering rewards for Nintendo purchases, but the rewards themselves are worth considering. You'll get a $20 certificate for every $150 you spend on Nintendo games and gear.
This sounds great in theory, if the Switch 2 itself was a qualifying purchase, but thefine print of the offer statesthat all Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 hardware is disqualified. With the price of someNintendo Switch 2 gamessitting at $80, though, you could easily spend over $150 with just two new game preorders.

"Ecoflow is one of the largest and most well-known manufacturers of portable power stations. Their products are solidly built with a lot of practical features at an affordable price point. Product support after the purchase is generally pretty good, and  firmware and software updates are consistently rolled out.

Ecoflow sells their power stations on several different marketplaces including Amazon, Costco, Walmart, eBay, and even directly on its own site. However, if you want the best deals on new (not refurbished) products, you'll have to head on over to AliExpress. There, Ecoflow sells its products under the handleEcoflow Local US Store. Their products ship from a local US-based warehouse and usually arrives within 3-5 days (past 20 days and you'll get a complete refund). Since Ecoflow itself is the seller, you're entitled to the 5 year factory warranty.
Below is a brief description of each power station that's on sale right now. Ecoflow carries several models and many of them have similar names, so it can be confusing trying to figure out which power station is right for you.
TheEcoflow River 3230Wh LiFePO4 Power Station is the most recent release in the River series.  It's about 30% more compact than the River 2. You can get it for $112 shipped after coupon code ""IFP3TXY"". The River 3 uses LiFEPO4 batteries with a 230Whr capacity. It has two AC outlets capable of 300W (600W surge), two USB Type-A ports, and one USB Type-C port with 100W of Power Delivery. The River 3 can be recharged using traditional AC and it will only take about one hour. Alternatively, you can recharge it using solar panels with a 110W max input. It can be monitored and controlled remotely via the Ecoflow app.
Unlike the Ecoflow River series, which are designed to be easily portable, the Ecoflow Delta prioritizes battery capacity at the expense of a much heavier weight. These are the power stations you want if you're thinking of replacing generators that can supply larger appliances and more power hungry electronics. The Ecoflow Delta 2 comes in two variants. The950Whr modelis $349.43 and the1024Whr modelis $375.53, both after a $50 off coupon code ""IFPD5NS"". The Delta 2 uses LiFePO4 batteries and can be expanded with additional battery packs. It has six AC outlets with up to 1800W output (2700W surge), four USB Type-A outputs (two with 18W fast-charge capability), and two USB Type-C outputs with 100W Power Delivery. It can be recharged via AC or with up to 500W worth of solar panels.
TheEcoflow River 2240Wh LiFePO4 Power Station is on sale for $124.87 shipped after you apply a $15 off coupon code ""IFP3TXY"". The River 2 uses LiFePO4 batteries with a 240Whr capacity. It has two AC outlets capable of 300W (600W surge), two USB Type-A ports, and one USB Type-C port capable of 60W Power Delivery.
TheEcoflow River 2 Maxsits right in between the River 2 and the River 2 Pro in terms of battery capacity, power output, weight, and price. It's currently $204.23 shipped at AliExpress after a $20 off coupon code ""IFP7FJZ"". The River 2 Max uses LiFePO4 batteries with a 499Whr capacity. It has four AC outlets capable of 500W (1,000W surge), three USB Type-A ports, and one USB Type-C port with 100W Power Delivery. It weighs about 13 pounds.
TheEcoflow River 2 Pro716Wh LiFePO4 Power Station is just $240 shipped after you apply a $40 off coupon code ""IFPI3V5"". This is a far more powerful version of the River 2, with nearly triple the battery capacity (716Whr). Like the River 2, the River 2 Pro uses LiFEPO4 batteries. It has four AC outlets capable of 800W (1,600W surge), three USB Type-A ports, and one USB Type-C port with 100W Power Delivery. It's heavier at 17 pounds, but still light enough to move around.
TheEcoflow Delta 2 Maxoffers nearly 2Kwhr of battery storage at an excellent price of $870.88 shipped after a $100 off coupon code ""IFPRZAZ"". The free shipping is nice because this beast weighs over 50 pounds. If you don't mind getting a refurbished model,Ecoflow's eBay storehas it for only $759 shipped. This power station has six AC outlets with a massive 2,400W total output (4,800W surge) for even the most power hungry of appliances and power tools.
If you don't mind buying a certified refurbished unit,Ecoflow's eBay Storeis your next best bet for finding the best deal. These prices are a bit lower than what you'll find on AliExpress and you'll get the same 5 year warranty as buying new. Also, Ecoflow states that ""On average, our refurbished products are only used around 10 cycles. This means that they've only been charged and discharged fully a total of 10 times. Since many of our newer products (DELTA Pro, RIVER 2/DELTA 2 series) have cycle lives of 3000+, this is only a tiny fraction of their lifespan.""

"Flexispot is running itsSpring Salewith up to 60% off the brand's most popular standing desks and ergonomic chairs. We like Flexispot because it offers quality electric standing desks with all the features you'd want at a fraction of the price compared to other more well-known models. We rated Flexispot's highes- end model, the E7 Pro, thebest overall standing desk of 2025. I've been using a Flexispot desk for years now and wouldn't pay more for a ""better"" desk.

You can quickly browse through all of the listed products on sale above. For more information on each product and why they are worth your consideration, read through below.
The Flexispot C7 offers a ton of features that are typically reserved for much more expensive chairs. This includes an automatically adjusting lumbar system, adjustable seat depth, adjustable armrests, adjustable seat tilt, adjustable headrest, 128 degrees of recline, and more.
Flexispot C7 Review(without footrest) by Bill Loguidice
The FlexiSpot C7 is a solid chair. For the price, however, I would have preferred a more premium-feeling leather or leather-like material instead of fabric, as well as more attention to some other aspects like cushioning. I also found the fact that you can't lock the wrist rests in place an occasional annoyance. If you don't mind some of its quirks and prize adjustment in a chair, then the C7 makes a good choice. Compared to straight-up gaming chairs, its sedate styling means it won't be out of place in even the most conservative of office environments. If you'd like a flashier or more luxurious offering, however, look elsewhere.
The Flexispot E5 desk is, in my opinion, the best value electric standing desk while still offering all the premium features you'd want. Right now it costs $199.99 (normally $379.99) for the base only and desktop surfaces start at $80. The Flexispot E5 is the least expensive model featuringdual motors, which are preferred over a single motor because they can support more weight (in this case 287lbs max) and they last longer because the stress is evenly distributed. The desktop is supported by a double crossbeam structure so that your surface is evenly supported to prevent any sagging. Most standing desks in this price range only have legs with a two-stage column, but this one features a three-stage column, which supports a greater vertical range (in this case 23.6"" to 49.2""). An anti-collision feature, a must-have in all desks, will stop the desk when it detects obstruction of the motor. Finally, the keypad controls offer three memory presets and a timer to remind you when to swap sit/stand positions. The E5 comes with a 10-year warranty on all metal, mechanical, and electrical parts and components, including the motor.
The E7 currently costs $299.99 (normally $499.99) for the base only and desktop surfaces start at $80. For an extra $140, the Flexispot E7 offers better build quality, a higher weight threshold, more included accessories, and a longer warranty. The lifting capacity has been upgraded from 287lbs to 355lbs. Aesthetically, the legs look more professional, with laser-welded seams, powder-coated finish, and no visible holes. The advanced keyboard has been upgraded with an LCD display, more memory presets, a built-in USB charger, and a child-lock function that's a necessity for those of us with inquisitive toddlers. The E7 also comes with a built-in cable tray under the desk to stow away all of your messy wiring. Finally, the Flexispot E7 boasts an increased 15-year warranty on all metal, mechanical, and electrical parts and components, including the motor.
The E7 Pro is the creme de la creme of Flexispot's standing desks. It's recent released so it isn't nearly as heavily discounted as the other models. Currently it costs $419.99 (normally $599.99) for the base only and desktop surfaces start at $80. The E7 Pro features the best build quality of the three listed here, and it certainly shows with a weight capacity of a whopping 440lbs. Flexispot claims the motor for the E7 Pro is superior to the standard dual motor setup you'll find in the E5 and E7 and other brands, offering smoother and faster movement. You also get more cable management options included than even the E7. The Flexispot E7 Pro comes with the same 15-year warranty as the E7 on all metal, mechanical, and electrical parts and components, including the motor. This is arguably thebest standing desk dealyou'll find anywhere right now.
Flexispot E7 Pro Reviewby Billy Givens
""A simple but effective keypad, quiet dual motors, near-perfect cable management, and excellent stability make the FlexiSpot E7 Pro a top-tier standing desk for work or gaming. Whether it's your first desk purchase or a replacement for an older model, it's hard to find many better options in this price range.""
I have three standing desks. One of the standing desks included a desktop, however for the other two desks I sourced on my own. For one of them I purchased a massive74""x26"" maple veneered countertop from Ikeafor $199. For the other one I purchased a48""x25"" solid wood countertop from Home Depotand finished it myself. Personally, I don't think you can go wrong with any of those choices, and there are more options available. The point is, these standing desk bases don't need the desktops sold by the manufacturer. If you want to install your own desktop, by all means do so as long as they are within the weight limitations.
I can only speak from personal experience. I own a Jarvis Fully, a Vari Ergo, and a Flexispot E5. All three are excellent desks that have caused me no problems whatsoever in the 3+ years of owning them, and that's the point. The Flexispot E5 is considerably less expensive than the other two options, and yet I don't really see where much of that cost is going. For a similar price of a barebones Jarvis Fully, you could get the top end Flexispot E7 Pro and still come out with more money in your pocket.

"I think today might be the day my wallet throws in the towel. Woot is coming in hot with one of thebest PS5 game dealsI’ve seen all year, and Sony’s decided we’ve all earned a full-blown audio upgrade. Between the markdowns onnoise-canceling headphones,portable speakers, andhome theater gear, it's giving ""treat yourself"" energy with ""I won’t regret this at all"" delusion.

I want at least three of these, but I’m pretending to be financially responsible and only putting two in my cart. If you’ve been eyeballing anything fromhigh-end headphonestosmart display cases for your action figures (I meancollectibles), now’s probably the best time to stop window shopping and start adding to your cart.
This Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code ""IFPRZAZ"" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16"" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.
$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.
I think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.
If you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.
At $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.
$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.
This speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.
Crisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.
This speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.
Bass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.
XM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.
A wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.
My living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.
I didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.
This TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.
I want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.
This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.

"Here are the best deals for Tuesday, March 11. HIghlights include rare discounts on PS5 Dualsense controllers from Lenovo, an Asus Chromebook for just over $100 from Best Buy, the coveted AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D back in stock on Amazon at a non marked-up price, big savings on speedy Samsung SSDs, power banks for your handheld gaming PCs, and more.

Lenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.
Last year the 9th generation iPad was the least expensive iPad you could get brand new and with warranty. It was regularly priced at $179, but it went out of stock pretty much everywhere starting from Black Friday. Fortunately, it's back for one final harrah; right now, Walmart has it available for delivery for only $179 shipped. Seriously though, this deal probably won't last much longer so don't hesitate.
Amazon is offering this Iniu 20,000mAh 65W USB Power Bank for only $21.59 after you clip the 40% off coupon on the product page (if you don't see it, try applying promo code ""WN9GQJRA""). This is a great price for a high-capacity power bank that can deliver more power than other power banks at the same price point. The 65W of power delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, and iPhone 16 at their fastest rates.
4TB for $259.99
Samsung's newest SSD - theSamsung 990 Evo PlusPCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Pick up the2TB modelfor $129.99 or, if you can swing it, the4TB modelis an even better deal at $249.99. It's currently$40-$70 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Proand most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.
If you're in the process of building out a new gaming PC and you're looking for the best gaming processor, this is it. Right now, the recently releasedAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DAM5 desktop processor is back in stock on Amazon and Best Buy at its retail price of $479 shipped. This is the official launch price with zero markup, and it's not bundled with anything you don't want or need. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming processor currently on the market (across both AMD and Intel) and a better choice for gamers than the more expensiveIntel Core Ultra 9 285K.
AMD's new Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards have been released, but just like their Nvidia counterparts, they're mostly out of stock and impossible to find at retail pricing. Don't fret, however, because you can still get these GPUs equipped in a prebuilt gaming PC for a reasonable price. The Radeon RX 9070 GPUs are the new mid-range champions of this generation. Both cards offer phenomenal performance while undercutting their Nvidia competition.
Apple's best earbuds are on sale today. Amazon is offering the second generationApple AirPods Prowireless noise-canceling earbuds for only $169.99 shipped, a savings of 32% and the best AirPods deal so far this year. That's about $20 more than theApple AirPods 4 with ANC, down from its usual $70 price premium. Between the two, the AirPods Pro is stillthe superior earbudsbecause it offers better sound quality and noise cancelation.
Chromebooks aren't exactly gaming-minded PCs, but they're compact, lightweight, great for productivity on the go, and in this case, a bargain. As part of Best Buy's Deal of the Day, you can pick up thisAsus 14"" Chromebookfor just $119 shipped after a $180 off instant discount, although I'd say the MSRP is a tad inflated. Even so, that's still a fantastic deal for a chromebook that features a relatively recent 8-core MediaTek processor which pairs well with Google Chrome OS.
You can grab this 10,000mAh power bank for only $8.99 after you clip the 10% off and 40% off clippable coupons on the product page. We very rarely see 10,000mAh power banks listed for under $10 so grab this one while you can. This will charge a Nintendo Switch from 0% to 100% about 1.9 times.
For a limited time, Hulu is offering four months of Disney+ and Hulu Basic (Ad-Supported) Bundle for just $2.99 per month. The normal cost of this subscription is $10.99 per month. This deal only comes around a handful of times per year and worth it for just the Disney+ subscription alone.
Pick up a five pack of USB Type-C cables for a grand total of just $7.96 after you apply promo code ""UNWEXMFD"". That averages out to about $1.59 per cable. Lengths include two 3.3ft, two 6.6ft, and an extra long 10ft cable. They're all rated for up to 60W of USB Power Delivery and are encased in a durable braided nylon sheath.
If you're searching for your next new game to play,Humble Choice Marchis now live, and this is the perfect bundle to discover something new! This month, Homeworld 3 headlines the bundle, with other PC games like Wild Hearts, Pacific Drive, Zau, and Gravity Circuit also included.

"Here are the best deals for Wednesday, March 12. Highlights include a rare discount on a (used) PlayStation Portal accessory, Lenovo-exclusive price drops on PS5 DualSense metallic controllers, the first discount we've seen on the iPad Air with M3 chip, USB Type-C cables for only $2.99 apiece, Destiny-themed SteelSeries gaming headsets, and more.

Used: Like New Condition
Looks and functions as if it were new. Moderate packing damage observed during inspection.
ThePlayStation Portalhas never been discounted, but at least you can save on a used one.Amazon Resale(a rebranded Amazon Warehouse) currently has Used: Like New condition PS Portals in stock for only $158.70 shipped. It retails for $199 new, so that's a substantial 20% in savings. A Sony warranty may or may not be included, but Amazon Resale items benefit from the same 30-day return policy you get for buying a new item. We expect this item to sell out pretty quickly.
Lenovo has just dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart. This is probably going to be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, especially one that's decked out in a eye-catching metallic colorway.
Amazon is offering a 6-foot INIU USB Type-A to USB Type-C cable for only $2.99 when you apply promo code ""C2ALZ6LN"" during checkout. You can add as many cables as you like and the discount should be applied to each and every cable. These cables are sheathed in nylon braiding for durability and can be used for both data sync and charging (Quick Charge 3.1A compatible). This is a great opportunity to stock up.
If you're thinking of jumping on the AMD bandwagon for your next upgrade, now is certainly the right time to do so. Alongside theRyzen 7 9800X3Dwhich debuted earlier this year, AMD has just released its two higher-end Ryzen 9 siblings in the Zen 5 ""X3D"" stack: the9950X3Dis available for $699 and the9900X3Dis available for $599. Collectively, these processors represent the best gaming chips across both Intel and AMD. Pure gamers should go with the 9800X3D and allocate their funds elsewhere; creators with deeper pockets and a penchant for gaming will benefit from the immense performance uplift on the new Ryzen 9 processors thanks to their increased core count and cache.
Thenew iPad Airsits in the middle of Apple’s tablet lineup, with better specs than the baseline iPad, but it’s not as powerful as the iPad Pro. That said, if you need more computing power in a tablet than what the baseline device above offers, the new iPad Air with M3 chip will likely suit you just fine.
As you can tell by the name, it has Apple’s powerful M3 chip, and it supports Apple Intelligence, unlike the baseline model. It’s also compatible with a new Magic Keyboard (see it at Apple) that has a row of function keys and a trackpad.
As part of its Spring Sale, SteelSeries is taking 40% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets. The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Desinty 2 in-game items.
As part of a generalHP Days Sale Event, you can score an excellent deal on a 4K-capable gaming PC. Right now, theHP Omen 25L GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super Gaming PChas dropped to $1,399.99 shipped after you apply $50 off coupon code ""HPDAYSPC50"". This is quite easily the lowest price we've seen for a prebuilt RTX 4070 Ti Super gaming desktop.
Amazon is offering a four-pack ofApple AirTagskeyfinders for only $64.49. That's over $35 off the retail price and only $16.10 for each AirTag. This is a very practical accessory for anyone who owns an iPhone and tends to lose small wearables like wallets, keys, or remotes.

"AndaSeatisn't as big of a name in the congested gaming chair market as some other brands like Secretlab, DXRacer, or Razer, but rest assured it makes somehigh-quality gaming chairs. Right now, there's anAndaSeat April Salegoing on with up to $220 off gaming chairs. These instant discounts stack with our 10% off IGN code ""AndaIGN"".

Use 10% off code: AndaIGN
The Kaiser 3 offers great value for a high-end gaming chair that competes with other chairs that cost $500 or more. The base model currently costs $386.10, which is about $60 cheaper than the Kaiser 4, and shares most of the same features. You lose out on the 5D armrests and the lumbar is less adjustable, but that's about it.
In hisAndaseat Kaiser 3 review, Mark Knapp wrote that ""The AndaSeat Kaiser 3 makes some meaningful improvements to the series’ design, including a wide seatbase that does away with metal bolsters for hours-long comfort and a flexible lumbar support built in. It uses magnets here and there in a gimmicky but not useless way, and it offers all the premiums that one should expect at this price in a well-polished package. It’s not quite perfect, still suffering some from the aggressive racing-style design, but it proves a great chair nonetheless.""

For 2025, AndaSeat has just released a new line of gaming chair that's sure to be a hit with the budget-minded audience. TheAndaseat Novis gaming chair– which retails for just $199 – is now shipping. Even better, you can use our 10% off IGN code ""AndaIGN"" to drop the price further to $179.10. The Novis looks like it has most of the comfort, features, and styling of other high-end gaming chair minus some of the more common gimmicks (like ""4D"" armrests).
Use 10% off code: AndaIGN
The Kaiser 4 is AndaSeat's flagship chair. The price normally starts from $569 but this sale drops it to $476.10 after the IGN code. It's only available in Extra Large with a weight capabity of 395lbs so this is a very spacious chair. You can choose among eight different color options in PVC leather or two different color options in fabric. It has all of the creature comforts you'd expect in a quality gaming chair, like a unibody 2mm tubular steel frame, one-piece high density foam with a plush seat bottom (softer, in my experience, than the very firm Secretlab seat), four-way lumbar adjustment system, 5D armrests, up to 135 degrees of recline and a rocking toggle, included magnetic armrests, and more. This chair sounds a lot like the Titan Evo, and you'd be right; the design, features, and build quality are very similar, minus the price tag.
Overall, Mark Knapp didn't like it as much as the Kaiser 3, however. In hisAndaseat Kaiser 4 review, he wrote that ""The AndaSeat Kaiser 4 has great lumbar support and one of the best headrest pillows you'll find on the market, but its janky armrests are a major blemish on the overall design, and its firm seat won't be for everyone. If you have the AndaSeat Kaiser 3, everything but the lumbar support may feel like more of a downgrade than an upgrade – and if this is your first gaming chair, you can do much better within the premium market.""

If you don't care for the distinct styling of gaming chairs, Andaseat also recently released a traditional-style task chair model called the X-Air. It's also less expensive, with the standard model starting at only $341.10 after the coupon is applied. This chair features a softer suede-like material that feels more comfortable than traditional mesh chairs. It comes standard with plenty of adjustability, but you can upgrade to the Pro model to get the dynamic lumbar adjustment, 5D armrests, and a 3D headrest. The Pro model also comes in a couple of very unique colors.
Both the Andaseat Kaiser 4 and 3 are excellent gaming chairs that are on par with the quality you'll find from more expensive chair manufacturers. That said, if you're willing to spend substantially more,Secretlabis still ourfavorite gaming chair brand. Secretlab recently released its flagship Titan Evo chair in a ""Nanogen"" edition and it is, in our opinion, the new best gaming chair. In ourTitan Evo Nanogen Edition review, Chris Coke wrote that ""the Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen Edition deserves every bit of the overwhelming praise I’ve given. Granted, at $799 it’s significantly more expensive than the original and not far off from an entry-level Herman-Miller. But the return it offers in comfortable, supportive gaming is well worth the extra cost thanks to dramatically improved materials in both the fabric and multi-layered padding. The Titan Evo Nanogen Edition is class-leading, and is hands-down the most comfortable gaming chair I’ve ever used.""
Secretlab also released anew recliner add-onto anyone who already owns the Titan Evo chair, and it has turned out to be a very practical addition that's worthy of its lofty $200 price point. In ourrecliner add-on review, Chris Coke wrote that ""while both comfort and value are subjective things, the recliner is able to take the Titan Evo and transform it from one of the best racing style gaming chairs to standing head and shoulders above the competition at its price point. It’s novel enough that I wouldn’t be surprised to see other brands following suit in the near future. If you don’t mind paying for it, it’s an absolutely killer upgrade for your gaming chair.""

"I expectedPokémon TCGrestocks in 2025, but not this soon. While everyone scrambles forPrismatic Evolutionsand floods paid Discord servers hunting for Rival Destinies, thesmartmove is picking up older sets from the Scarlet & Violet and Sword & Shield eras before they disappear—especially now that Amazon just got a massive restock.

You won’t find Prismatic Evolutions or muchSurging Sparksstock just yet, but for collectors, this is a gold mine.ETBs, Big Boxes, Booster Bundles, and more are all here—straight from Amazon Global. That means stock has been pulled from the UK and other regions to ensure wider availability.
This is exactly what the community needs: a flood of inventory that makes botting and scalping far less appealing. I've dug through everything, and just to make things easier, sorted it all by category alongside a handy TL;DR just below.
All of these ETBs are harder to come by thanks to Pokémania 2025. There's some amazing cards to be found in these sets, from Greninja Secret Art Rare (214/167) found inTwilight Masqueradeto The Loyal Three Secret Art Rare set found inShrouded Fable.
Surging Sparks Booster Bundle is the biggest restock here thanks to the infamous Pikachu ex Secret Illustration Rare (238/191) and the sets other amazin cards such as Latias ex Special Illustration Rare (239/191) and Milotic ex Special Illustration Rare (237/191). It's also a great time to snap up from Brilliant Stars boosters, with chances of pulling Charizard V Alternate Art (154/172) and the stunning trainer gallery sub-set.
Whilst these are the most awkward thing to display or store for collectors, there's some cool promo cards andaccessoriesfor TCG players. There's even some discounts knocking around, such as the Paradox Fury Premium collection down 12% at $60.11. This is probably one of the better boxes to buy from this restock as it's a 2024 Amazon holiday exclusive.
There's a collectors scene for just the tins people, and they come in handy for storing bulk, dice, sleeves and whgatever else trainers need to their battles.
A good tip here is to buy anything with a Pokémon V card as their promo card. This means you'll get Sword and Shield era booster packs inside, which are going to be harder and harder to find as we move into the second half of 2025.

"Amazon’s Big Spring Sale will soon reach its conclusion today, March 31, so you've got until the end of the day to secure a great deal. While it might not have the same hype as Black Friday or Prime Day, the discounts speak for themselves, and there's so many great offers to choose from still— including the lowest prices of the year on tech like Apple AirPods, Kindles, Fire TV Sticks, and must-have items like50 series GPUs, andPokémon TCG cardsback in stock for a limited time.

Amazon’s dedicatedSpring Sale hub has plenty of deals, but we’ve done the heavy lifting for you on the final day of the sale, highlighting only the best discountsactuallyworth your time. Every deal we feature is either at its lowest-ever price, matches its best price of the year so far, or is so hotly sought after we can't help but mention it. We’re keeping this list fresh with real-time updates, so you won’t miss out on the biggest savings before the sale ends.
There are already some incredible doorbuster deals in the Amazon Spring Sale 2025. One of the best is theINIU 10K power bank for just $9with code S7LY7824 and clipping the 50% coupon – a record low price. It’s an absolute must-buy, especially for iPhone users, but even beyond that, it’s just anoutstanding power bankat an unbeatable price. If you grab only one thing from this sale, make it this. You can findmore coupons worth clippingto score additional savings on books, robot vacuums and more.
Other tech deals include the standard slate ofApple products, likeAirPodsand thenewest Apple Watch, as well as Amazon devices likeFire TV.
It'd be silly not to mention thelatest round of Pokémon TCG stock at Amazonduring the sale, with elusive Elite Trainer Boxes like Twilight Masquerade available again, alongside a slew of other hot booster sets likeSurging Sparks.
One of our favorite deals during theSpring Sale is The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Editions, all at all time low discounts, and in thebuy two get one freedeal. It's one of the best offers we've seen all year.Sunrise on the Reaping, the new Hunger Games novel, should also be on your radar.
Other books in the sale include chart-topper Onyx Storm, and its fellow Empyrean series booksIron FlameandFourth Wing, alongside theHarry Potter Illustrated Books.
For just individual book deals, we also love theSkyrim Library, a three-volume collection of texts, now down to just$49.99 when clipping the coupon at Amazon. A gloriously good deal for a magnificent set of books. We've also seen plenty ofcomics, likeUltimate Spider-Man, and even select vinyl (also within the 3 for 2 promotion) included in the deals.
LEGO sets are getting more expensive, but they always seem to get solid discounts during these types of sales. Some of thebest LEGO dealsfrom the current sale include discounts on theLEGO Wednesday collaborationas well as some very cozyLEGO Animal Crossing sets. Some of ourfavorite board gamesfor both families and adults are included in the sale. We've also seen tons of deals on 90's comebacks includingaction figures,plushies,Nerf gunsand evenBop It! toys(that apparently still exist).
Amazon has also discounted tons ofindividual movies and TV shows, includingold-school Warner Bros. cartoonsandfilms directed by David Lynch.
It's always the right time to get accessories you actually need, but it's even better to get them on sale. That said, Amazon has discounts on variousPS Portal accessory deals. My other favorites that are worth considering includeAudible Premium Plus for $0.99, theApple AirPods Pro 2 for $169.99,Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth for $32.99, and65"" LG C4 4K OLED Smart TV for $1,397.
The Amazon Spring Sale (March 25-31) couldn’t come at a better time. With no major shopping holidays between now and Memorial Day, this is one of the best opportunities to score great deals before summer. WhilePrime DayandBlack Fridaymight bring even steeper discounts, those are months away – if you’re looking to save right now, this sale is your best bet.
That said, strategic shopping always wins. If you’re eyeing a big-ticket item like aTVorKindlebut don’t need it immediately, waiting for a larger sale could be worth it.

"Localthunk, the developer behind breakout roguelike poker gameBalatro, has stepped in to resolve a bit of a scrum in the Balatro subreddit over a mod's statements on AI art.

It's a bit of a wild story, so bear with me here, and thanks toGarbage DayandRock Paper Shotgunfor spotting all this. Essentially, it starts with DrTankHead, a now-former moderator of the Balatro subreddit and also current mod of a NSFW Balatro subreddit.
The moderator had expressed no issue with AI art content, both on the NSFW and main Balatro subreddits. ""We will not be banning AI art here, if it is properly claimed and tagged as such,"" the mod saidin a post. ""This has been done after discussion with the staff at Playstack.""
Localthunkposted a short reply on Bluesky, saying this is not how they, nor their publisher at Playstack, felt about AI generated imagery. Then, the developerwent to the subreddit to make a full statement.
""Neither Playstack nor I condone AI 'art'. I don't use it in my game, I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds. The actions of this mod do not reflect how Playstack feels or how I feel on the topic. We have removed this moderator from the moderation team,"" Localthunk said.
""We will not be allowing AI generated images on this subreddit from now on. We will make sure our rules and FAQ reflect this soon.""
In afollow-up, Playstack's communications director noted that the rules around this ""should have been clearer,"" as a rule calling for ""no unlabeled AI content""could have been interpretedas allowing or supporting the content on the subreddit. The remaining mod team is planning on clarifying this language for the future.
As for the original mod, DrTankHeadpostedin the aforementioned NSFW Balatro subreddit, confirming they've been removed as a mod of r/Balatro. They went on to say that it is ""not their goal"" to make the NSFW Balatro subreddit AI-centric, but they are considering a ""day of the week"" situation where ""non-NSFW art that is made with AI can be posted.""
In response, one user replied: ""Please just get off Reddit for a week or two.""
Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI.The game failed, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”
That hasn't stopped tech companies going all in on AI, though. EA said in September thatAI was ""the very core"" of its business, and more recentlyCapcom said it was experimenting with generative AIto create the ""hundreds of thousands"" of ideas needed for in-game environments.Activision recently admitted using generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assetsamid a backlash to an ""AI slop"" zombie Santa loading screen.

"Amazon'sBig Spring Saleis marching forward right now, and it couldn't be a better time to check out the latest discounts. To great excitement, I've managed to find some of the best comics going, discounted, and included in the epic3-for-2 offerwe've been raving about all week. It's essentially buy two, and get an extra pick for free.

There's a whole slew of incredible comics and graphic novels to choose from in the sale, such as classics likeTMNT: The Last Ronin,V for Vendetta,Secret Wars,Daredevil: The Man Without Fear (Frank Miller), and more. But what I'm especially excited about is the inclusion of several from Marvel's rebooted Ultimate series, such asUltimate Invasion,Ultimate X-Men Vol. 1,The Ultimates Vol. 1, andUltimate Spider-Man Vol. 2.
For example, you could pick up The Ultimates, Ultimate Invasion, and Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 2 for a total of $41.78, asignificantreduction versus paying for all three separately at MSRP, $69.97. That's $28.19 in savings if you buy while the sale is still live.
But it's not just comics. There are plenty of other exciting additions, which means you can mix and match books, graphic novels, vinyls, and more, and get the cheapest item for free. Thefull selectionis packed with must-haves, including bestsellers like Sunrise on the Reaping andThe Lord of the Rings Illustrated Editions.
Moreover, while Spider-Man Vol. 2 is included in the 3 for 2 deal, Vol. 1 is not. But, it hasdropped to its lowest price everof$7.50 at Amazon, which means it can easily be paired with your fresh set of new Ultimate comics as well.
There are plenty of other great deals to keep an eye on during the Spring Sale. We've highlighted some of our top picks below, but for a more comprehensive look, check out our full breakdown ofAmazon's Big Spring Sale. The event runs until March 31, so there's still time to grab the best discounts before they're gone. Stay tuned—we'll keep updating with the latest standout offers as they drop.

"If you've been hunting forScarlet & Violet Prismatic Evolutionsbooster packs without getting fleeced by scalpers,Amazon’slatest offer is a tough fallback.This six-pack booster bundle is listed at $59.99—more than double the expected MSRP of around $27. That’s a staggering 122% markup, and with demand still outpacing supply, even Amazon has hiked its prices well above retail.

The availability is still good, as you’re not fighting bots or hoping your local store remembered to stock anything. This is probably your best shot today that doesn’t involve rolling the dice with potential scams through third-party sellers. Still, if you do decide to buy, do it with a fair warning that this is a heavily increased price.
Prismatic Evolutionsis stacked. This is an Eeveelution collector’s dream (and a wallet’s nightmare). The Special Illustration Rare cards in this set are already climbing to jaw-dropping prices on resale sites.
The single card market, however, is a different story. Prices are slowly coming down, with Dragapult ex coming right down from over $100 to around $45 alongside Roaring Moon ex.
Umbreon ex (161/131) is the crown jewel, going for a laughable $1,298 in lightly played condition. It’s absurd, but it’s exactly the kind of pull that justifies ripping packs like a gremlin. Sylveon ex (156/131) isn’t far behind, selling around $450 depending on condition, and Espeon ex (155/131) continues the psychic-type price madness with listings near $300. Some sellers are offering copies in the $90 range, but blink and those are gone.
Jolteon ex (153/131) brings the lightning with prices hovering around $265 for near mint, although listings under $100 do pop up — briefly. And then there's the rest of the Eevee family: Vaporeon, Flareon, Glaceon, and Leafeon ex are all pulling serious numbers, with some copies going well over $250, and even the “low” end listings still sitting in the $75–$100 range.
Of course, it’s not just about the Eeveelutions. Pikachu ex (179/131) might be one of the few heavy hitters in this set that’s still hovering under $100, currently around $70, but Pikachu is never a bad pull recently. Roaring Moon ex and Dragapult ex round out the list of top chase cards. Both are popular picks, with prices ranging from $45 to $200 depending on the condition and the whims of the secondary market.

"Anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch will know about Joy-Con stick drift. It’s when the Joy-Con Control Sticks stop responding correctly, or suffer from ""drifting.""

Complaints aboutJoy-Con driftwere so loud that Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa apologized for the ""inconvenience"" and launched a free repair program. Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has talked about the ""battle against"" Joy-Con drift, insisting Nintendo was making continuous improvements. It was such a big problem that parents in the U.S. tried to sue over Joy-Con drift in a class-action lawsuit, although Nintendo ended up fending that off.
In 2022, a UK consumer group allegedNintendo Switch's Joy-Con drift issue was caused by a fundamental design flaw. A report from Which claimed that, even after just a few months of use, the Joy-Con's plastic circuit boards show significant wear on the joystick slider contact points,causing Joy-Con drift.
This week, Nintendo fully unveiled the $449.99 Switch 2 in a Nintendo Direct, showing off the new Joy-Con 2 and its extra functionality. InNintendo Switch 2 tech specspublished by the company, there is no detail on the sticks themselves. So as of now, we don’t know for sure if Joy-Con 2 use the hall effect sensors Nintendo fans are desperate for.
As Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto described in a new 'Ask the Developer' interview, the Switch 2's Joy-Cons have “larger and more durable” analog sticks “with smoother movement.”
It was a similarly vague response when Nintendo was asked about Joy-Con drift improvements at a hardware-focused roundtable Q&A in New York yesterday, attended by IGN.
Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, told the assembled media that the new Joy-Con 2 controllers were redesigned “from the ground up,” but failed to say anything specific about drifting.
“As you may have witnessed and felt, the new Joy-Con 2 controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been really designed from the ground up, from scratch, and they've been designed to have bigger movement and also smoother movement,” Sasaki said.
In the 'Ask the Developer' interview, Kawamoto talked about the new Switch 2 Pro Controller and its sticks, saying they’re ""quieter.""
“Aside from the color, the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller may look indistinguishable from the previous controller at first glance, but it was also redesigned from scratch,” Kawamoto explained.
“In particular, the left and right control sticks are quieter and don’t make noise, even when they’re moved quickly to the edge. Also, they glide very smoothly, so we've taken to calling them ‘smooth-gliding sticks.’ (Laughs)”
Sasaki added: ""As they’re calling them ‘smooth-gliding sticks,’ we made efforts to reduce the feeling of bumping when you tilt them. In fact, there's been a long-running project at Nintendo with the grand ambition of developing the ‘pinnacle of all controllers,’ and we’ve been researching it hard for a long time now.”
The proof of the pudding is in the eating, of course. We won’t know how the Switch 2 Joy-Con hold up under strain perhaps until years after the console comes out. But hopefully, based on what Nintendo is saying now, Joy-Con drift will be a thing of the past.

"With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its wayandits audience.

Capcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.
But in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.
2016 was a bad year for Capcom.
The big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.
This was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.
All of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .
Achieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.
Capcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4.
2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema.
Unfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.
“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.
This directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op.
This downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.
But it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.
This slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.
It was clear something needed to change.
By the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability.
While neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.
“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”
Those constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6.
""We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V,"" Nakayama says. ""And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title.""
All this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards.“There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.
“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”
The team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.
There was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master.
“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.”
Street Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series.
While they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.
While Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.
Around the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience.
“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”
If you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.
“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”
Itsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance.
No other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened.
Firstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.
“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”
Monster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.
This created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.
But the reality was that Monster Hunterdidhave fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.
Released in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.
“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”
It was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”
It wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world.
“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”Tsujimoto says.
One important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.
This explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.
“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”
Monster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call.
“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&D teams were divided into R&D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”
Takeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.
There were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.
“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.
The game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series.
But Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time.
“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.
The result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history.
Naturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?
Ampo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”
But despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.
Around the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.
“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.”
Itsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.
The 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. ""Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively,"" Itsuno says. ""When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”
This vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should.
Ampo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, ""So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.”
This meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.
“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”
Since 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.
Focusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat.
But what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.
Many of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever.
When asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”
Monster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”

"There’s a fine line between “I deserve this” and “this was a financial mistake,” and today’s deals are absolutely walking it. I’m looking at In Stock Pokémon bundles that practically dare you to stop at just one. Humble Choice is finally delivering a lineup that doesn’t feel like leftovers, and the Assassin’s Creed collectibles over in the IGN Store have officially moved from “maybe someday” to “I’ve added it to my cart twice already.”

In my opinion, these are the kinds of deals that are actually worth talking about — not the 7% off a charger you didn’t need to begin with. This is six-pack booster bundles available now, games I’ve had on my wishlist for too long, and statues that will silently judge you from a shelf while looking really, really cool. If you're going to buy stuff, at least let it be stuff that makes you happy and mildly ashamed.
From ourpreview: ""Based on the Loyal Three and their Moochi-feeding mythical master, Pecharunt, the Shrouded Fable set features some key players of thePokémon Scarlet & Violet DLC: Hidden Treasures of Area Zero, amongst new additions. It's a packed set, with Kingdra ex also making a royal splash in the expansion.""
This one’s a bit of a reality check. The actual MSRP for six of these packs is around $27, so Amazon is being bold by doubling that and calling it a deal. Still, given how hard Prismatic Evolutions is to find at retail without hunting down individual packs like a Pokédex-obsessed raccoon, this is sadly one of the better options right now. I wouldn’t call it a bargain, but if you’re just itching to crack open some fresh packs without resorting to third-party sellers, it gets the job done.
This is one of the few Pokémon TCG products still hovering close to MSRP, which basically qualifies it as a miracle in 2025. You get three solid booster packs, some stickers to slap on your laptop or emotional baggage, and a stackable tin that may or may not match the others in your accidental collection. It’s not flashy, but it’s a solid option if you just want some new packs to rip without playing the “Is this seller legit?” game.
This month’s Humble Choice doesn’t feel like a clearance rack, and that’s saying something. Tomb Raider is doing the nostalgia thing in the best way, and Dredge is that weird horror-fishing crossover I didn’t know I needed. Aliens: Dark Descent rounds it out if you like your sci-fi chaotic and stressful. Honestly, I’d pay the $12 just for those three — and still walk away feeling smug.
This bundle is a case of “available at a premium or not at all.” MSRP should be closer to $27, but good luck finding that price in the wild. The return of Shiny Pokémon is the big hook here, and that’s probably what’s driving the markup. I think it’s steep, but if you’ve been chasing the set and want to avoid eBay roulette, this is probably your safest play.
This is the kind of collectible that makes you pause and consider rearranging your entire shelf, your priorities, and your bank account. Some of these statues are genuinely beautiful. Others are so expensive they make me nervous just looking at them. But if you’ve got deep franchise loyalty and shallow impulse control, this is your moment.
Elite Trainer Boxes are rarely good dollar-per-pack deals, and this one’s no exception. But what you’re really paying for is the full kit: sleeves, promo card, storage box, and a mildly delusional sense of organization. I actually like this set for collectors who want more than just cards. It feels like a full-on project, and for $55, it’s one of the few Pokémon bundles that still comes close to feeling like it's worth the money.
This is the one I’d keep in my bag daily. It’s half an inch thick and can charge an iPhone 8 about 3.6 times or a Galaxy S22 almost twice. The USB-C port handles both input and output (a rarity at this price), and the dual USB-A ports mean you can charge multiple devices without carrying five bricks. It’s cheap, sleek, and has a literal paw print on it. Adorable and useful? Yes, please.
I think this is the sweet spot if you bounce between devices. You get three outputs, including one that’ll fast-charge a MacBook Pro 14"" or your Steam Deck while you’re multitasking. There’s even a pop-out phone stand built in. It’s like if your power bank also respected your time and your binge-watching habits. At under $40, it feels like a steal.
I picked up Death’s Door for five bucks and didn’t even hesitate. The Humble Store’s latest sale is packed with portable-friendly gems, perfect for a Steam Deck or travel laptop situation. Highlights include Dead Cells: Road to the Sea Bundle for $16.49 (50% off), Detroit: Become Human for just $11.99, and Dying Light Definitive Edition at $14.99. If your backlog needs more chaos, this is how you feed it on a budget.
This is my pick for weekend trips or carry-on duty. It’s got solid charging speed, a clean LED display that shows exactly how much juice is left, and enough capacity to last through a few full phone charges. It even handles smaller accessories like AirPods or smartwatches without flinching, which is more than I can say for some people.
This Gallica statue is up for preorder at $129.99, and yes, I want it just for the wings. It's 8.9 inches tall with glossy clear parts and Magla particles swirling on the base. The sculpt is absurdly detailed, which probably explains why I’ve already mentally cleared shelf space despite the fact it doesn't ship until November 2025. Patience is hard, but preorder now, panic later.
If I’m packing a laptop, a tablet, a phone, and something else probably unnecessary but still USB-powered, this is what I’m bringing. It hits 100W output, recharges itself fast via USB-C, and can handle charging multiple high-power devices at once. It’s a bit of a tank, but in the way you want when you're relying on it to keep everything alive.
If I had to pick a favorite just for everyday carry, it might be this one. It’s compact, fast, and charges three devices at once. I love the built-in phone stand, especially for killing time in waiting rooms or pretending I’m not watching TikTok in public. For $20, it’s a little charger that does a lot.
I don’t need six booster packs, but these are usually in and out of stock. ThisSurging SparksBooster Bundle has some fantastic chase cards, we're talking $400+ chase cards that could be in this Booster Bundle. It’s under $50, which in Pokémon terms is basically a clearance sticker. I'm not saying it'll change your life, but it might improve your afternoon.
This is the TV I’d buy if I wanted something that works without having to pretend I care about specs. It turns on, the picture’s 4K, it has Alexa so I don’t have to get off the couch, and it costs less than my last grocery run. Honestly, that’s more than enough.
I don’t usually gravitate toward games based on cartoons, but this bundle is stacked if you’ve got kids or just want a break from games that scream at you.Bluey, PAW Patrol, My Little Pony — the whole crew’s here, and honestly, they’re better made than half the AAA titles I’ve rage-quit. Pay $20 or more, get a pile of games, and support charity. Seems like a win for everyone except your free time.
I like this one because it feels unnecessarily large in the best way. You get Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and it still costs less than a concert ticket and a hoodie. If you want to make movie night feel intentional without spending your life savings, this does the job.
I want this on my shelf mostly so people ask what it is and I can pretend I understandDeath Stranding 2. It’s a 1/350 scale model of a massive mobile base from a game that hasn’t even released yet, and I respect the level of commitment required to care this much. It’s $69.99, which is fair for something this weirdly specific and detailed — and yes, the railgun is included.
This is the kind of TV I’d get if I wanted it to last longer than my attention span. It’s a 2024 model, has LG’s updated processor, and handles all the streaming stuff without having to download three extra apps just to log in. Feels like someone at LG actually thought it through.
I think this is what happens when Samsung realizes not everyone wants to spend $650 to track their steps. The titanium build is overkill in a good way, and the battery life means I don’t have to charge it every time I blink. It finally dropped to a price where it makes sense to buy one without feeling like I’m auditioning for a tech influencer role.
i’ve been watching theJourney TogetherElite Trainer Box like a hawk, and somehow it’s actually in stock at Amazon for $70.31. That’s 30% off apparantly, but it's not at all. It includes nine booster packs, a full-art N’s Zorua promo, sleeves, and the usual accessories, Most people just want the packs and the promo. If it’s gone when you check, keep trying. I’ve seen stock randomly reappear in the mornings and lunch time, just likeTarget's Journey Together stock.
Then there’s the Paldean Fates Booster Bundle at $69.77. Six packs inside, and the draw here is the return of shiny Pokémon. I like that it cuts straight to the good stuff — no sleeves, no dice, no cardboard fluff, just a clean bundle of packs ready to be cracked open. If you’re chasing shinies, this is where the hunt begins.
Humble Bundle’s “Best of Boomer Shooters 4” is live right now, and I love how chaotic it is. For $16, you get $174 worth of retro-inspired FPS games likeTurbo OverkillandForgive Me Father 2. I think of it as therapy, just with more blood and less talking about my feelings. You also support some good causes, so now your nostalgia trip is technically altruism. You're welcome.
Shrouded FableETB is holding steady at $54.96, and I think it’s slept on. It has nine packs, a Pecharunt foil, some sharp sleeves, and a player’s guide that you’ll absolutely ignore until you pull something weird and have to look it up. This set's all about the Legendary trio—Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti—and if you’re into building themed decks or hoarding off-meta cards, this one hits.
Finally, if your card obsession extends beyond Pikachu, the Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors’ Dreams trading cards are now up for pre-order on the IGN Store, starting at $20. I already pre-ordered a box because the idea of serial-numbered Chun-Li cards is somehow more exciting to me than it should be. Rare pulls, killer art, and a chance to relive the 90s one Hadouken at a time — I’m in.
I picked up one of the Paradox Clash tins just for fun and honestly, no regrets. For $39.96, you get five booster packs and either a Walking Wake EX or Iron Leaves EX promo, chosen completely at random. It’s a bit of a gamble, but opening tins is half the fun anyway. The promos are clean, the packaging is slick, and I think it makes a solid gift for anyone getting into the game
For a cheaper fix, I’d go for the $12.25 blister pack with three random boosters and a foil promo. It’s 39% off, which is honestly kind of wild, and it’s one of those no-risk purchases you can talk yourself into without too much guilt. The listing shows Silver Tempest Boosters, so there's a good chance of pulling some Sword and Shield chase cards here.This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.

Samsung Galaxy S25 Reviewby Mark Knapp
""The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is an incredibly versatile, elegant, and powerful phone. It should stand out as the best Samsung has to offer, but after years of iteration on this device and a price tag that sets it certainly above many of its competitors (except Apple), the Galaxy S25 Ultra frequently had me asking, “is this the best Samsung can do?” Samsung’s displays, once the best, now have little to stand out from the many excellent competitors. The phone’s performance may top the charts briefly, but quickly sinks below the competition in sustained usage. And even the technically impressive cameras fail to offer the character that might make them lovable. Samsung really needed near-perfection this year, and all it delivered was greatness.""
Next, Samsung has discounted various 4K TVs, like The Frame series or the75"" QN90D. These are all quality models that act as a perfect upgrade to any living room, bedroom, or media room. There's also savings on various Q-Series soundbars, which are essential for the besthome theater experience. You can even save $200 off The Freestyle, an all-in-oneprojectorthat can create a huge image while outputting 360-degree sound.
Samsung has discounted both Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 7 models, which makes today the perfect time to upgrade if you're still using an older model. The newer Galaxy Watch 7 brought improved sensors, battery life, and more. We have it ranked asthe best Android smartwatch out there. Additionally, both Galaxy Buds 3 andGalaxy Buds 3 Proare excellent earbuds for Android users. While the battery life can be less than ideal at times, we still found the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to be great inour 8/10 review.
Finally, there are many different deals on gaming monitors, memory cards, and storage options. Our favorite deal is 51% off the 34"" Odyssey QD-OLED G8, as this deal includes a 32"" ViewFinity S7 (S70D)4K UHD Monitorfree of charge. It's hard to beat two monitors for the price of one.

"Mortal Kombat 1 developer NetherRealm has revealed a detailed look at T-1000 gameplay, and a look at a new Fatality packed with references to Terminator 2.

In the video, below, we see the T-1000 use various liquid metal abilities to move about the screen, absorb hits, and poke at his enemies. Even shapeshifting sorcerer Shang Tsung praises the T-1000’s abilities during one pre-match trash talk cutscene.
The highlight of the video is the look at one of the T-1000’s Fatalities, which includes three references to Terminator 2. The first is the iconic finger point through the eyeball, the second the arm blade through the mouth, then the elevator door parting, except through the T-1000’s foe’s torso. Its animality sees the T-1000 transform into a K-9 German Shepherd, another reference to Terminator 2. In the film, John Connor's foster parents owned a German Shepherd named Max. The Terminator calls the dog Wolfie to trick the T-1000.
The T-1000 in Mortal Kombat 1 is of course based on the liquid metal-based cybernetic assassin from the 1991 blockbuster Terminator 2: Judgment Day film, and features the voice and likeness of actor Robert Patrick.
Here’s the official blurb on the T-1000 from NetherRealm:
The T-1000 Terminator joins the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on March 18 as part of the early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners, followed by wide availability for purchase on March 25.
Meanwhile, we get another look at the upcoming Kameo character Madame Bo. In the trailer we see her Fatal Blow, a move in which she batters her enemy’s face with her slipper. Madam Bo will be available as a content update for all Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns owners at no additional cost or via standalone purchase on March 18.
T-1000 is the final DLC character set to be added to the 5 million-selling Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s success.
Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things,the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat.
In September, Mortal Kombat development chiefEd Boon said NetherRealm had decided on its next game three years prior, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”
Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series,Injustice: Gods Among Us, launched in 2013, with its sequel,Injustice 2, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm releasedMortal Kombat 11in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.
Inan interview with IGNin June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. ""There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't,"" Boon said.
Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).
""But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal,"" Boon said. ""We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' ""
Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.
""Not at all,"" Boon answered.

"As of March 8, the Pokémon TCG: Scarlet & Violet—Paldean Fates Premium Collection is back in stock at Amazon for around £50. This set includes eight booster packs, three etched foil promo cards, and an oversized Quaquaval ex, but the real draw is what could be inside those packs. Paldean Fates has some of the most valuable Shiny Pokémon cards we’ve had for a while.

Paldean Fates follows the trend of special sets featuring Shiny Pokémon reprints, much like Hidden Fates and Shining Fates. Those sets became nearly impossible to find at retail after a few months, and this one is on the same path. It’s packed with rare and playable cards, so collectors and competitive players are snapping up packs fast. Unlike regular sets, Paldean Fates guarantees at least one Shiny Pokémon every three packs on average, making it one of the more rewarding sets to open.
The biggest chase card in the set is Charizard ex (Special Illustration Rare), currently selling for over £200. Charizard cards always hold value and are usually playable, making them even more desirable. The stunning artwork features Shiny Charizard in Dragon Tera form, making it a must-have for collectors. If past Charizard chase cards are anything to go by, this one isn’t going to drop in price anytime soon.
Right behind it is Mew ex (Special Illustration Rare), which is going for over £350. Known as ""Bubble Mew"", this card stands out for its unique, stylized artwork that makes it look completely different from any Mew card before it. It’s not just collectors driving up the price. The card is playable and highly sought after for competitive decks, making it one of the most valuable pulls in the entire set.
Gardevoir ex (Special Illustration Rare) is another high-value card, selling for close to £100. This version had big expectations after the Scarlet & Violet base set’s Gardevoir ex Special Illustration Rares, but it delivers with a softer, dreamlike art style. Gardevoir has always been a fan favorite, so it’s no surprise that this card is among the most expensive in Paldean Fates.
If you’re after classic Pokémon, the Shiny Rare Pikachu is one of the hardest to find. Despite being the same rarity as other Shiny Pokémon, its £40+ price tag proves just how much collectors want it. Pikachu cards are usually easy to find (Bar Surging Sparks of course), but this one is different. It’s part of the Shiny Vault subset, which means there’s a huge pool of possible pulls, making it tough to track down.
Iono (Special Illustration Rare) is one of the best Trainer cards in the set and is selling for over £35. It’s one of the most playable supporter cards in the game, meaning players need multiple copies, and this version has incredible alternate artwork. It was the most expensive card in the Japanese version of the set, and while it’s not quite at that level in English, it’s still one of the best pulls you can get.
There’s also strong demand for Shiny Charmander and Charmeleon because no one wants an incomplete evolution line. Charmander is selling for over £25, and Charmeleon is around £15-£20, mostly because players want them to go alongside Shiny Charizard ex. These are the kinds of cards that only become harder to find over time, especially as more people complete their collections.
Paldean Fates has solid pull rates, making it one of the better sets to open if you’re hoping to find something valuable. Shiny Pokémon show up about once every three packs, and there’s a real chance of hitting a Special Illustration Rare or Hyper Rare every 50 to 60 packs. While that might sound like a long shot, it’s far better than what we’ve seen in some past special sets likePrismatic EvolutionsandShrouded Fable. Every pack feels like it has potential, which makes it easy to keep opening more.

"Deep discounts can be found on tons of thebest PlayStation Portal accessoriesthanks toAmazon’s Big Spring Sale, and today is the final day to save. From cases and screen protectors to docks and headphones, these items either enhance your playing experience or help protect Sony’s remote player. Right now, many accessories are 10% to over 40% off, bringing the lowest prices of 2025 so far. Chances are good you won’t see savings like these for at least another few months, so now is the time to buy.

Sure, thePlayStation Portalmay not be as portable as the name suggests, as it relies on a strong Wi-Fi signal to stream games. Still, if you’ve got a good connection, you can take the device just about anywhere. Plus, thePlayStation Portal now supports cloud gamingvia a PlayStation Plus subscription, so a PS5 is no longer required to play.
If you’ve been hesitant to buy the gaming handheld in the past, this added functionality brings more value. You can evengrab the PlayStation Portal in a new Midnight Blackcolorway, and then be sure to get some discounted accessories to go with it, since only a USB-C to USB-C charging cable comes in the box.
With a large and sharp 8-inch LCD screen and Dual Sense style controls, the PS Portal is susceptible to damage. An accidental drop or too much pressure in a bag could end up bricking the pricey remote player, making a case a high priority.
Orzly’s caseis one of thebest PlayStation Portal casesyou can grab. It perfectly matches the device’s dimensions for a snug fit, offers a padded section for accessories, and comes with a hard shell for extra protection, and the case is $15 off during Amazon’s sale. Want something a little less expensive? There’s a great deal at the moment on a durablecase from FYOUNGwith similar features to the Orzly case. If you need something extra tough, theSTARTRC GAMES Carrying Caseis designed to take on a little more wear and tear than your average hard shell case. It’s also on sale.
A zippered hard shell case won’t protect the PlayStation Portal when you’re actually playing a game. So, those with butter fingers might want to consider some additional protection. A screen protector is a great way to prevent cracks to the precious display when the device falls from your grip, and our favoritetwo-pack of screen protectors from ivolerhappens to be a part of Amazon’s sale. Speaking of grip, a form-fitting case, likethis discounted option from Qoosea, gives you a better handle on the device while wrapping it with an extra layer of protection against scratches, dust, and more.
Rather than buying each accessory individually to keep the PlayStation Portal safe in various situations, plenty of accessory sets are on sale during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. These kits come with a hard shell case for travel and storage, a form-fitting cover for protection while you play, and screen protectors to keep scratches to the screen at bay. Some go even further, offering thumbstick covers and extra space for SD cards, cords, and more.
While most PlayStation Portal accessories focus on protection, a couple others are worth the investment to make life with the device even better.
You'll want a pair ofgreat gaming earbudsto keep games distraction free, andTurtle Beach’s Battle Budsare currently discounted. Yes, these are wired because the PlayStation Portal does not support Bluetooth audio. Wireless headsets require PlayStation Link support. Unfortunately, we’re not seeing any major discounts on the few options that do offer PlayStation’s proprietary wireless.
A charging dock is another sound purchase, as you’ll need something to top up the remote player after its 7 to 9 hours of battery life runs out. A charging dock provides a secure place to store your device as it charges. Our favorite charging dock, theFYoung Charging Dock Stationis on sale, and beyond charging the Portal in 3.5 hours, it adds some visual flair to your space with 14 customizable color options. Asimilar option from LVVILis also on sale.

There’s something uncanny about the office.
It has furniture and lights and doors, but nothing you would ever put in your own house. You eat in a little room they tell you to, wear drab office clothes and make cordial office friends. It’syou, but it’s not yourlife.It just kind of feels that way sometimes. A drop-shipped dupe of the designer handbag that is the human experience.
Severance is a show that explores the outer limits of this artificiality.It’s a paranoid Philip K. Dick mind-melterin a prestige TV package, exploring the unsettling otherness of an office setting that’s just slightly outside the bounds of reality.
Many of us have little choice but to spend much of our short time on earth existing in an office, which means we’re about as familiar with the look and feel of the space as we are with our own faces. When things are even just a little, tiny bit off, we notice. That’s the theory behind the “uncanny valley,” the idea that the closer humanoid robots look to real people, the more that subtle, slightly-askew differences will make them exponentially more freaky.
If a robot is a cartoony abstraction like Bender Rodriguez, people are totally fine with it. But if you deck him out in some fake skin over a highly articulated endoskeleton, ourmonkey-brain “flight” responsescan’t help but kick in. It’s how our brains evolved to perceive things, possibly to prevent us mingling with other early hominids.
ThinkDisney’s Hall of Presidents, or all thoseandroid girlfriendson display at CES. The more something resembles the real thing, the more that small, almost imperceivable differences matter. Achieving perfection is essentially the only antidote to this phenomenon.
The uncanny valley is what makes the CG animation of Bob Zemeckis movies so skin-crawling. It’s why we cringed through Mass Effect: Andromeda. The reason AI generated babies raise instinctual alarm bells. When something is notquiteright, it can feelverywrong.
In Severance, Lumon Headquarters is located in a fake town called Kier in a fake state called PE situated deep within the uncanny valley. The facility features sprawling, identical hallways of impeccably sterile decor. Dozens of meticulously labelled doors that can lead anywhere from a cookie-cutter conference room to a deranged faction of goat-keepers.
Lumon isn’t the workplace we know, it’s the one we visit in our nightmares, the mundane ones where you completely forgot about a project you were supposed to be working on for months and it’s dueright now. It’s a dreamlike space of fuzzy details and a barely-audible buzzing of dread.
Severance is heavily informed by the aesthetic of “liminal spaces,” impossibly vast, eerily familiar environments designed to instill a sense of dread and confusion. Imagine a dead mall that sprawls on for infinity, or a surreal fast food playplace with slides that don’t end and ball pits that are deeper than the diameter of the planet.
Liminal spaces came to prominence thanks to the spread of the Backrooms, acreepypasta that first appeared on 4chanback in 2019. “In the Backrooms,” wrote the surprisingly eloquent poster who will forever remain anon, there’s “nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in.”
The Backrooms is a true internet original,a memetic masterpiece that belongs to no one and every one. It spawned a series of short films,countless streamer-bait jump scare gameson Steam, and, soon, a major motion picture from A24.Severance creator Dan Erickson citedThe Backrooms, as well as its video game predecessor The Stanley Parable, as one of many inspirations for the show’s dreamlike unreality.
He also named The Matrix, The Truman Show, and Dark City, films featuring characters who realize they are trapped in an obscene simulacrum of life, manipulated by powerful forces beyond their control or understanding. Even before our naive heroes learn the truth, they begin their journey by seeing the slight cracks in the seemingly perfect facades around them– enlightenment achieved by way of the uncanny valley effect.
The notion ofawakening from a constructed realityruns deep within Severance, not only thematically but aesthetically. The Truman Show, in particular, with its deliberately anachronistic clockwork world, seems to inform the show's interpretation of the timeless essence of the office.
Lumon’s design language isn't a pastiche of any particular era, though the earth tone interiors and Brutalist tech evoke the ugly interiors of the ‘60s and ‘70s. The severed floor exists outside of any specific time or place the same way its employees exist outside of their real lives. It’s a boiled-down, hyperreal, evocative impression of what a workplace is.It’s not the office, it’s Officecore.
There’s been copious discussion about how Season 2 of Severance doesn’t quite live up to the high bar set by its predecessor. Some attribute that to unsatisfying follow-ups to the first season’s revelations. Others might point to a ramping up of the mystery box-ification that has plagued buzzworthy TV shows since Lost.
For myself, I’ve found the show slightly less interesting since it shifted its focus away from the workplace. Outdoor team-building exercises, diversions to hellish hometowns, and an increased emphasis on the outside world has diminished what made the show so special in the first place: the unsettling excursion into the uncanny valley of our artificial office lives."
"There was aton of new info to take in from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. Luckily, we’ve picked out the most important details about the console, including when you can play it and the technology behind it, in this handy article. So, let’s get straight to it.

4. The screen itself is a 1080p LCD monitor, with double the amount of pixels of the original screen. It also supports HDR (High Definition Range) and 120fps for an even smoother gameplay experience.

6. The Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage, a mammoth eight times the amount of space the original came with.
7. If you simply have too many games and need even more room, MicroSD Express cards are the only type that can be inserted for extra storage. Frustratingly, original Switch microSDs won’t work.
8.The Switch 2 will also be using a new type of game card. They’re red as opposed to their predecessor’s grey, and have a faster reading speed.
9. The audio capabilities of the Switch 2 appear significantly improved, with better quality speakers allowing for increased range, as well as 3D audio available when using headphones. Great, now we’ll be able to hear that blue shell coming for us directly from behind.
10. There’s also a built-in microphone on the top of the console that comes into its own when using the Switch 2’s brand-new GameChat feature (more on that later).
11. It also possesses two USB C ports. One on the bottom, just like the original Switch, and one on top to make charging easier when in tabletop mode, or if you want to take advantage of the new Nintendo Switch Camera 2 accessory.
12. The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera will be available on the same day as the console. It will cost  $49.99/£49.99 and can be used to put your face into games, such as Mario Party Jamboree, or as an overlay when playing with friends.
13. The Switch 2 joy-con connects magnetically to the console via the bigger, metallic SL and SR buttons, and also has larger analog sticks.

15. A new Pro Controller will also be available for the Switch 2. It comes with programmable GL and GR buttons on the grips and will be available for $79.99/£74.99.
16. Other official accessories revealed at this time include Mario Kart steering wheels, a Switch 2 carry case, and an “all in one” carry case that can store and carry all equipment needed to play in TV mode.

19. A Mario Kart World Bundle will also be available at launch. It comes with all of the above, plus a copy of the game. This will cost $499.99/£429.99.
20. And finally, the big mystery of the Switch 2’s C button was finally solved.GameChat is a new party voice channel systemfor the Nintendo console that will allow players to talk to friends, and all begins with a press of that button.
21. The microphone on the top of the console promises to pick up players’ voices over the top of background noise, whether be busy traffic or a vacuum cleaner on the other side of the room.
22. It will also allow players to share their screens with others, much like PlayStation’s share screen tech, so that you can see what your friends are up to or even help them with a particular puzzle.
23. GameChat, of course, comes with a price, though. And that admission fee is a Nintendo Online membership. That will only be the case after March 31st, 2026, however, as before then it will be available to all Switch 2 owners for free.
And that’s all the quickfire information we picked out from Nintendo’s extensive Switch 2 Direct. Are you planning on picking up a Switch 2 at launch? Let us know in the comments. And for everything else Switch 2, stick with IGN.

"There’s a whole new version ofSupermanon the horizonfrom James Gunn, and with it comes Nathan Fillion’s Green Lantern. The actor opened up about how his version of Guy Gardner will be different from other film and small screen versions — and it turns out he isn’t exactly going to be the most charming iteration of the character.

""He's a jerk!"" Fillion toldTV Guidein a recent interview. ""What's important to know is,you don't have to be good to be a Green Lantern; you just have to be fearless. So Guy Gardner is fearless, and he is not very good. He's not nice, which is very freeing as an actor because you just think to yourself, what is the most selfish, self-serving thing I can do in this moment? And that's the answer. That's what you do in that moment.”
Fillion even added that Gardner’s superhero alter ego has a bit of a hubris issue. “I think if he has a superpower, it might be his overconfidence, in that he thinks he could take on Superman,” the actor explained. “He can't!""
The upcoming Superman isthe first film entry in an entirely rebooted DC Cinematic Universeand will helm the inaugural chapter ofthe new DCU, titled Gods and Monsters. But the DC establishment isn’t the only one interested in the Green Lanterns. HBO is also currently shooting a series-style look at the other members of the superhero alliance calledLanterns, with Kyle Chandler playing Hal Jordan and Aaron Pierre playing John Stewart. As of now, that show is set to premiere in 2026.
Superman starsDavid Corenswet as Clark Kent, Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, Milly Alcock as Supergirl, and Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor. The film was written and directed by James Gunn, and is set to fly into theaters on July 11, 2025.

"It’s official: 2017’s animated hitCocowill, in fact, be getting a sequel — Coco 2 is in the works!

“While the film is just in the initial stages, we know it will be full of humor, heart and adventure,” Disney CEOBob Igerrevealed of the film's development as part of The Walt Disney Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. “And we can't wait to share more soon.”
Coco was critically acclaimed at the time of its release and managed to take home two Academy Awards, one for best animated feature and another for best song for the original track “Remember Me.” The film also won a handful of other prestigious awards, including the Golden Globe for best animated feature, a BAFTA for best animated film, and two Critics Choice Awards for best animated feature and best song.
Naturally, Coco 2 will bring back the team behind the original film, including director Lee Unkrich, who is also known for directingToy Story 3, and co-director Adrian Molina.Toy Story 4andInside Out 2producer Mark Nielsen will produce the project.
It’s clear that Disney-Pixar deeply believes in the overall Coco franchise following the first film. Back in August 2024, the company revealed that the movie would be getting its veryfirst Disney Parks attraction at Disneyland’s Disney California Adventure. According to the concept art Disney revealed at the time, it seems the attraction will feature tons of beloved Coco characters and resemble something like their iconic Pirates of the Caribbean ride in its style and presentation. The ride is set to become part of the Disney experience sometime in 2026.

"Do you like fun, reader? Then you might just enjoy this cute little piece of news: as of today, streaming serviceDisney+now has a 24/7 streaming channel solely forThe Simpsons. Yep, all Simpsons, all the time.

According to the Walt Disney Company, the “always-on” streamincludesa whopping 767episodes of the beloved animated series. That means seasons one through 35 are available to binge — and Season 35 just completed in May 2024, so this is nearly the entire Simpsons catalog.
The episodes will be programmed in chronological order on the stream at the time of launch, and the channel will ultimately consist of an incredible 300 hours of Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart, and Maggie. The company also noted that the stream will be “refreshed monthly” and specifically available to premium subscribers.
It’s cool to see The Simpsons being honored in this way, especially at a time when the show has shifted a bit from what it once was. Back in November 2024, Pamela Hayden, who is best known as the voice of Bart’s BFF Milhouse Van Houton,retired from the series after 35 yearsvoicing many of Springfield’s most notable residents. Hayden was also the voice behind Jimbo Jones and Rod Flanders, among many others. As of now, it’s unclear if Milhouse and Hayden’s other characters will be recast or written off the series entirely — but one thing is for sure, Hayden will not be part of the series going into season 37.

"The boys are back in town — and by the boys, I mean Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman.South Parkhas finally announced a return for Season 27, and it looks as though our favorite Colorado crew is dealing with, well, the state of things. And by dealing with it, I mean barely.

The beloved animated seriesdebuted a new trailerannouncing the upcoming season, but cleverly psyched the audience into thinking it was a dramatic sneak peek at a new drama. The intense editing and music added to the ominous vibes... until Stan’s dad Randy and his sister Shelley pop up on-screen and he asks her if she’s been taking drugs. “Because I think it could really help you,” he says as they sit on her bed with a Wicked movie poster in the background.
The visual heads back to intense action following the gag, seemingly teasing several big (and topical) moments from the season, like several major plane crashes, the Statue of Liberty being pulled down, a P. Diddy appearance, and some kind of war with Canada. To be fair, you’ve probably been expecting that last one if you’re a longtime fan of the show, or even if you’ve just seen the 1999 film South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.
The teaser also reveals that the season will premiere on July 9, 2025 on Comedy Central, over two years after the end of Season 26. The series has aired three specials since then: 2023’s South Park: Joining the Panderverse and South Park (Not Suitable For Children), and 2024’s South Park: The End of Obesity.
South Park celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2022, having debuted on Comedy Central to near-instant acclaim back in 1997.

"ForFriendsalum David Schwimmer, the iconic ""I'll Be There for You"" theme song we all know and love had worn out its welcome by the time the show ended its 10 season run in 2004.

""I'll Be There for You"" by American pop rock duo the Rembrandts set up each episode of Friends during its entire decade-long domination of global TV. It became one of best-known and most-listened to songs in the world, and remains in the public consciousness today as Friends continues to pull in viewers on streaming platforms.
“I’ll be really honest, there was a time for quite a while that just hearing the theme song would really… ”  he recently told Matt Lucas and David Walliams on their podcastMaking a Scene. “I just had that reaction. I mean, I just had heard it so many times.”
Naturally with the show in syndication, he was bound to be exposed to it quite a bit over the years — but according to Schwimmer, the music was everywhere beyond those classic apartment walls. “Any time you’d go on a show or a talk show or an interview, that would be your intro song,” he added. “So I just didn’t have the greatest response to it.”
The legendary sitcom star, who is perhaps best known for his role as Ross Geller on the show, also revealed that he never returned to the series to even watch an episode or two following its end. That is, until his daughter Cleo “discovered it around age nine or something.”
“For me, it’s like, I did it, I’m moving on. I don’t really go back and revisit,” he said, before adding about his change of heart. “I’d be making breakfast or whatever and I’d hear my kid’s laughter. My whole relationship to that song and to the show changed.”
To be fair, we probably wouldn’t ever want to hear that song again either if we were him. Friends aired its finale episode on May 6, 2004 after 10 years on NBC. A reunion special Friends: The Reunion aired in 2021 on HBO. The entire series and the special are available to stream now on MAX.

"If you’re a Minecraft die-hard, you might have seen one particularly sneaky Easter egg in the new film adaptationA Minecraft Movie— but all is not what it seems. According to Mojang Studios Senior Creative Director of Entertainment and producer on A Minecraft Movie, Torfi Frans Olafsson, that moment that seemed to be alluding to the 2010 Creepypasta storyHerobrineisn't an Easter egg, but a mistake the visual effects team ran out of time to fix.

Warning!Spoilers for A Minecraft Movie follow:
For context, A Minecraft Movie has a scene that takes place at the Woodland Mansion where Henry (Sebastian Hansen) meets an Enderman who puts him in a state where he’s able to see a vision of Steve (Jack Black), except the character is verbally berating him as his eyes go white. Because Herobrine is characterized as Steve with white eyes, fans were convinced that the moment signified that there was a future for the Creepypasta story within the MCU (Minecraft Cinematic Universe, duh).
However, Olafsson has cast doubt on this assumption. ""It’s super strange that all of their eyes were supposed to be purple but when it was rendered one of the characters eyes kept coming out white in the final rendered frames so we wound up keeping it like that, because the VFX studio ran out of time,"" he revealed onX / Twitter.
In the early Minecraft days, an anonymous poster on 4chan claimed they saw an in-game version of Steve with white eyes and weird powers showing up around the game. Following the post,a Creepypasta storysurfaced, which “revealed” that the character anomaly was actually the spirit of a dead player.
Olafsson's comment is being taken by many fans as a knowing wink to this being a genuine Herobrine Easter egg in A Minecraft Movie. After all, the joke is that it's an unfixable error, that Herobrine appears and can't be removed.
We’ve got plenty more on A Minecraft Movie, includinghow rowdy fans are creating wild scenes in the cinema, causing some to say it’s ruining their experience.
IGN’sA Minecraft Movie reviewreturned a 6/10. We said: “Napoleon Dynamite director Jared Hess puts a surprisingly specific and funny comic spin on A Minecraft Movie’s kid-friendly adventure, especially in its less antic first half.”

"I can’t even believe I’m saying this but... it’s game over for the Saw franchise, at least for now. It has been confirmed that the upcomingSaw XIhas officially been stalled and, at this point, will not be released in the fall as originally scheduled.

That said, this isn’t a creative issue. “We haven’t heard anything since May,” Saw XI screenwriter Patrick Melton toldThe Hollywood Reporter. “It’s stalled at a managerial level. It has nothing to do with the creative or anything else. There’s higher-level things at play.”
According to the publication, Melton and his writing partner Marcus Dunstan submitted a draft of the script in spring 2024, which is coming up on a year ago. Melton added: “The reason it’s held up is just, there’s inter-squabbling between producers and Lionsgate. They just can’t quite get on the same page.”
Frequent franchise director Kevin Gruetert wasattached to the project back in December 2023, when it was given a September 2024 release date. But fans were gutted when the film was ultimatelydelayed for an entire year, with a new September 2025 release date in place. Franchise diehards hoped it was for the greater good of the story, especially after the box office success that wasSaw X. The 10th installment had really brought the franchise back to life in numbers terms, garneringover $120 million globallyduring its theatrical run, which naturally had execs itching to make Saw XI.
What’s worse is the 11th installment was set to deal with a timely topic. Though plot details have not been made public for Saw XI, Melton compared the plot of the film to that ofSaw VI, which was written by Melton and Dunstan and directed by Gruetert. In it, lead John Kramer, aka Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), takes revenge on a group of health insurance executives.
“Saw XI may or may not be made, but we have a very timely story in it, and I hope it gets made just because of that,” Melton told THR.
“It taps into the same themes of Saw VI, where you’re a citizen, you feel angry and frustrated with something, you feel like you can’t do anything, and John Kramer’s going to do it.” It would be quite interesting to see the Saw franchise go down this road again and how they would do it differently, considering the state of the world at the moment — but sadly, it seems we may never know.

"Thailand is far from Hogwarts, no doubt, butThe White LotusSeason 3 star Jason Isaacs still has some thoughts on who should take over his role as Lucius Malfoy inHBO’s upcoming Harry Potter TV series.

“Meryl Streep,” the What If…? voice actor revealed as his choice toVarietyin a new interview focused on The White Lotus.
“She can do anything, that woman. There’s literally no limit to what she can do.” Streep has actually played a man once before; she portrayed several characters in the HBO miniseries version of the epic play Angels in America, one of which was an elderly male rabbi. So, honestly, she could probably pull this off.
That said, Isaacs doesn’t have any advice for her, or anyone who might end up stepping into his role. “I wouldn’t have any advice at all. Why would I bother?” he said. “I know some of the people they’re casting already. They’re brilliant actors. It’s going to be fantastic, and the last thing they need is advice from some old fart like me.”
Isaacs debuted as Lucius Malfoy in the second Harry Potter film,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and then reprised that role in the fourth film,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, onward through to the final installment,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. As for this upcoming adaptation, there is only one confirmed casting choice at the time of publishing this story.
John Lithgow is set to star as Albus Dumbledore, originally played by Richard Harris and then Michael Gambon, in the upcoming series. The only other roles that seem close to being cast are professors Severus Snape, originally played by Alan Rickman, and Minerva McGonagall, originally played by Maggie Smith. Black Mirror starPaapa Essieduisreportedly close to being cast as Snape, while Jessica Jones star Janet McTeer is allegedly close to being cast as McGonagall — but there are no official confirmations for those roles just yet.

"While gaming has moved forward with bigger and more powerful consoles, theAtari 2600 Plusoffers a way to revisit the era of classic cartridge gaming. Right now, it'savailable for £50.13—half its usual price of £99.99—at its exclusive UK retailer, Amazon.

Released in November 2023, theAtari 2600 Plusmodernizes the original console’s design while maintaining compatibility with both Atari 2600 and 7800 cartridges. It connects easily to modern TVs via HDMI and includes a widescreen mode to better fit contemporary screens.
If you still have old cartridges like Space Invaders or Asteroids, they’ll run just as you remember. The system also comes with a CX40+ Joystick Controller, faithfully recreating the original’s design, along with a 10-in-1 cartridge featuring titles like Combat, Missile Command, and Yars’ Revenge:
For those looking to expand their collection, a second joystick is available separately for multiplayer games, and the 4-in-1 Game Cartridge Plus Paddle Pack adds titles like Breakout and Night Driver.
With its mix of nostalgia and modern convenience, the Atari 2600 Plus makes it easy to revisit classic games. And with this price drop, it’s a good time to pick one up.
In ourAtati 2600 Plus review, IGN's Seth Macy had this to say: ""Every time I walk past the Atari 2600+ sitting on the floor of my living room, controllers and games scattered around it, I'm instantly transported to the 1980s. Everything about its design is painstakingly authentic to the original while making necessary updates to bring it into the modern era. Atari collecting is easier than newer systems, but playing those carts has always been a bit tough since the original hardware was designed for an era when few TVs had coax inputs, much less composite video.""
""Being able to output to HDMI makes playing your original carts a snap, although seeing Combat on a 65"" 4K screen doesn't really add anything to the experience. The Atari 2600+ is a fantastic upgrade to the original hardware that stays faithful to the original where it counts the most. Part of me wishes it had wireless controllers, but the other part of me knows that would take away from the experience I remember as a little kid in front of a 13"" black & white tube television. And ultimately, the Atari 2600+ is about taking you back.""

"With the overwhelming amount of actors jumping intothe Avengers: Doomsday cast— like, hello, did you see the livestream?! — it’s a pretty natural step to think that maybe, just maybe, Halle Berry would return to theX-Menand reprise her iconic role asStorm. Sadly, it seems as though that beautiful theory willnotbe working out the way fans hoped.

“We want to see your name on a chair for Avengers: Doomsday, we want Storm,”Black Girl Nerds told Berry on the red carpet at CinemaCon in Las Vegas recently, to which the Never Let Go star replied with a chuckle and: “keep waiting. Not gonna be there.”
Fans have been eager to see Berry make her first official appearance in the MCU as it stands today, even before the Avengers: Doomsday cast reveal. She first appeared as Ororo Munroe, also known as Storm, inBryan Singer’s 2000 adaptation of X-Men, where she starred alongside a now iconic ensemble cast of Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, James Marsden, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romjin, Ray Park, Famke Janssen, and Bruce Davidson. She went on to reprise her role in 2003’s X2, 2006’s X-Men: The Last Stand, and 2014’s X-Men: Days of Future Past.
Each of these films were produced by 20th Century Fox before they were purchased by Disney and integrated into the current MCU — so fans seemed to be really holding out hope that she would finally make an official appearance within Marvel’s new world.
Then came last month's Avengers: Doomsday cast reveal, which was heavy on veteran X-Men actors. Kelsey Grammer, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, and James Marsden are all now set to appear in Avengers: Doomsday, confirming the X-Men are in the film in a big way. Grammer famously played Beast in the Fox X-Men franchise beforemaking his MCU debut via The Marvels' post-credits scene. Stewart played Charles Xavier/Professor X in the X-Men films before appearing briefly in the MCU via Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness as a member of the Illuminati. McKellen, who played Magneto, has yet to appear in the MCU. Neither has Cumming, who played Nightcrawler, Romijn, who played Mystique, nor Marsden, who played Cyclops. It begs the question:is Avengers: Doomsday secretly an Avengers vs. X-Men movie?
And then,Marvel and Robert Downey Jr. teased they’re not done yet, which led fans to believe the likes of Halle Berry and other former X-Men actors who didn't make the cut still had a chance.
Berry's next official appearance on the big screen, however, is a film called Crime 101, featuring Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Barry Keoghan, Monica Barbaro, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Nick Nolte. It is said to be releasing sometime this year.

"TwoZenless Zone Zerovoice actors discovered they had been replaced when the game'spatch noteswent live, they have claimed, in the latest casualty of the battle for generative AI protections.

The Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists' (SAG-AFTRA) ongoing dispute with the video game industry revolves around the use of generative AI to replicate voice actor performances.
ZZZ, developed by Genshin Impact company HoYoverse, is not subject to the strike because it was in development before July 25, 2024, when the strike began. However, voice actors may choose not to sign new contracts in solidarity with striking union members, or in the absence of a SAG Interim Agreement.
Emeri Chase — who portrays Soldier 11 — said they were ""replaced as Soldier 11 because I am unwilling to perform work not covered by a SAG Interim Agreement during a strike for AI protection, the outcome of which will determine the future of our industry."" Nicholas Thurkettle, who played Lycaon, has been similarly replaced, although Thurkettle is not a union member.
""I'd like to clarify that there's a difference between being 'struck' and not being on an Interim Agreement,"" Chase explained in a thread onBluesky(thanks,Eurogamer). ""Union projects that began work prior to the strike and non-union projects are not 'struck.' But they also do not offer the Union-enforced AI rights we are fighting for.
""Many actors are choosing to voluntarily withhold work on these categories of projects because we feel it is the best way to support the union's fight for the protections that are critical to our continued ability to create the art we love.""
Chase added that they knew ""that by withholding work it was possible"" they'd be replaced, but had ""hoped [developer HoYoVerse] would choose to leave her silent until I was able to return.""
""I found out the role was recast today alongside all of you,"" Chase said, while Thurkettle stated: ""I'm learning about this as you are, and I share your shock. Neither HoYoverse nor Sound Cadence has communicated with me since October. I've been fully available and recorded multiple voice jobs in that time.
""I'm not SAG but what game companies want to do with AI is an existential threat. I took a personal stand to ask for protection, and had to be willing to give up the best thing that's ever happened in my professional life. I stand by my choice.""
IGN has asked HoYoVerse for comment.
In a similar case from December,Activision confirmed it had recast some members of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 castafter fans noticed much-loved Zombies characters with new voices in-game.
The company issued a statement toGame Developeradmitting characters in Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode were recast amid the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike.
Zombies characters William Peck (Zeke Alton) and Samantha Maxis (Julie Nathanson) are currently voiced by new, unknown actors. Alton told Game Developer that he took no issue with Activision’s actions with Peck, but expressed concern “for my brand as a performer.”
“Fans of the game have reached out to me because the lack of crediting [of the replacement actor] implies that it may still be me which unfairly represents my abilities as a performer,"" Alton said at the time.

"One of the most fun things about movie-making is remembering all of those little things that almost were and could have been. So many things change in pre-production, post-production, and even the actual production itself — and forCaptain America: Brave New World, one of those things was the role Giancarlo Esposito was going to play.

Esposito ultimately played Sidewinder in the film, but was originally approached to play King Cobra. The Breaking Bad legend revealed toEmpirein a recent interview (via Collider) that producer Nate Moore hadoriginally asked him to portray Klaus Voorhees’ alter ego.
""If I'm walking around the neighborhood, African-Americans go, 'What's up, King?' I love it. They call me King, baby! I mean, that's the highest honor,"" Esposito recalled thinking in those early days. ""But as it turned out, there [are other Kings] in the Marvel world, and this was connected to the Serpent Society — they were going back to the comics and trying to figure it out, and Nate said, 'We can give you all the characteristics of King, but we think he should be Sidewinder.' ""
Voorhees appears in the Captain America comics as a former convict who has to contend with a radioactive snake bite after his murder plot to axe colleague Professor Ezekiel Schektor doesn’t quite go as planned, hence the name King Cobra. In his time on the page, he has battled the likes of Mr. Fantastic, Thor, and Daredevil, as well as Cap and Falcon.
That said,the creatives behind Brave New Worldultimately had Esposito play Sidewinder, aka Seth Voelker, an economics professor who gets chemically mutated by the Roxxon Oil Company and becomes a crime boss and the leader of Serpent. Over the years, he’s had major face-offs with Scarlet Witch, The Thing, Triton, and Stingray — but now he’s having one with Cap himself.
""They spoke about creating a character that was really grounded, in a mercenary fashion,” Esposito added, noting that the character was shaped inthe film's robust reshoots. “They wanted to ground the movie when they went back in to do some additional shooting, and their focus now was on this additional character. So it was a bit of a whirlwind for me. I focused myself and I went in there and knocked it out.""
As for the character’s future in the MCU, it seems at least Esposito wants him to stick around. ""I'm hoping to be in this universe a little longer,"" he said.
It’s no secret thatCaptain America: Brave New Worlddidn’t exactly light the world on fire in terms ofcritical response, fan response, or box office. Check out IGN's feature,Captain America: Brave New World’s Real Budget? You’ll Never Know… and This Is Why, to find out more.

"An unedited fight scene fromthe scrapped Batgirl moviewas pulled offline after it surfaced on social media on March 19.

X / Twitter account DC Film Newsposted the now-deleted videoaround 8pm Eastern time and captioned the post: “A look behind the scenes of the fight choreography for ‘BATGIRL’.” The caption also credited stunt performers Emily Cartagena, Scott Rogers, and Stephen Dunlevy for their work in the clip.
A look behind the scenes of the fight choreography for ‘BATGIRL’.Stunt performers: Emely Cartagena, Scott Rogers, & Stephen Dunlevy.pic.twitter.com/2fJmFsFXc1
Theraw footage— which made no effort to hide harness cables, clearly proving this clip was far from finished — showedLeslie Grace as Barbara Gordon, aka Batgirl, fighting a group of men in a room, presumably an apartment.
Despite the men having an advantage in size, she was far from losing the fight. At one point, she smashed through a wall that led to a bathroom on the other side where someone was sitting on the toilet, adding a splash of comedy to the action scene.
Sadly, there’s next to no hope of ever seeing this scene in its final form. Nearly three years ago, Warner Bros. cancelled the release of the Batgirl film, helmed by Ms. Marvel showrunnersAdil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, amid restructuring two months prior.
Batgirl would have been next on the now-scrapped DCEU slate if Warner Bros. hadn't cancelled it, coming out ahead of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom and Joker: Folie à Deux.
WarnerMedia merged with Discovery Incto become Warner Bros. Discovery in April 2022, which is also when David Zaslav — who was CEO of Discovery Inc prior to the merger — became CEO of WBD. The decision to shelve the practically completed Batgirl film garnered muchbacklash within the industryand also from the general moviegoing public.
The movie, which was written by Birds of Prey writer Christina Hodson, was going to follow Gordon as she balanced a double life as Gotham’s head of police Commissioner Gordon’s daughter and a by-night vigilante. Alongside Grace, J.K. Simmons, Brendan Fraser,Michael Keaton, Ivory Aquino, and Jacob Scipico were also set to star.
Last year,Batman actor Michael Keaton admitted he was not all that bothered about Warner Bros. deciding to scrap the release of Batgirl.GQasked Keaton whether he found the fate of Batgirl disappointing, considering he reprised his iconic Batman role opposite Leslie Grace's titular superhero. The short answer was ""no."" He was unfazed by the cancellation but did admit to feeling bad for the movie's directors, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah.
""No, I didn't care one way or another. Big, fun, nice check,"" Keaton said while, according to the outlet, rubbing his fingers together in a money gesture resembling the act of clutching dollar bills.

"Production onHouse of the DragonSeason 3 is underway, and HBO is celebrating the milestone with an updated list of new cast members.

The network announced that the Targaryen-centered Game of Thrones spinoff had begun work on its third season today, revealing all of the familiar names set to make a return alongside a batch of new names, too. No release date for House of the Dragon Season 3 has been announced quite yet, but HBO says that, like Season 2, it is expected to run for eight episodes. The face of dragon queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, Emma D’Arcy, helped kick off day one of filming witha celebratory video for fans.
The fight for the Throne is far from over.S3 of#HOTDis now in production.pic.twitter.com/NUe4POwIJM
D’Arcy will be joined by series veterans Matt Smith (Daemon Targaryen), Olivia Cooke (Alicent Hightower), Steve Toussaint (Corlys Velaryon), and more as Dragonstone and King’s Landing continue their war for the hearts of Westeros – and the Iron Throne.
Joining them for House of the Dragon Season 3 are newcomers Tommy Flanagan (Sons of Anarchy) as Ser Roderick Dustin and Dan Fogler (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them) as Ser Torrhen Manderly. James Norton, who was previously announced as another fresh face for Season 3, has been brought onboard as Ormund Hightower.
Directors for the third season include House of the Dragon familiars Clare Kilner, Andrij Parekh, and Loni Peristere, as well as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Supernatural veteran Nina Lopez-Corrado.
House of the Dragon will continue its television adaptation of George R.R. Martin’s Fire and Bloodwhere Season 2 left off. That means Westeros remains on the brink of war despite a few revelations shared between Alicent and Rhaenyra in the last batch of episodes as peace becomes all the more unlikely. We gave Season 2 a 7/10 inour review.
Previous comments from showrunner Ryan Condal have revealed that House of the Dragon is planned to run forat least four seasons.

"Several of thenew 2025 Samsung TVsthat were showcased earlier this year atCESare now available for purchase at Samsung's official online store. Select Samsung Neo QLED and OLED TVs are currently in stock and they ship out immediately for as early as April 9-10 delivery. Alternatively, you can pick up select models at your local Best Buy. Not every TV has been released yet, but I expect more models to become available soon.

Samsung showcased several of their top models duringCES 2025. Here's a quick rundown of the biggest highlights. At the moment, exact pricing for each model is unknown.
Samsung revealed a total of six Mini-LED TV models for 2025, and three of the models are available for purchase starting today. The Neo QLED QN990F andQN900Fare true 8K TVs with some incremental improvements like the new anti-glare tech, the One Connect wireless transmitter box, and access to Samsung's Art Store, which was previously retricted to the Frame TVs. The Neo QLEDQN90F, QN85F,QN80Fand QN70F are the new 4K Mini-LED models. The highest end model is the QN90F and it will feature the same 165Hz refresh rate, Gen 3 processor, and anti-glare coating as the S95F. The mid-range QN85F will be Samsung's first 100"" TV.
The new OLED TVs - the S95F, S90F, and S85F - feature several incremental upgrades over its predecessors. The S95F, Samsung's flagship model, boasts a new NQ4 AI Gen 3 processor, a faster 165Hz refresh rate, an improved anti-glare coating, and an upgraded QD OLED panel that promises up to 2,000 nits of brightness. The S90F will also feature the Gen 3 processor, 144Hz refresh rate with VRR, and a QD OLED panel with up to 1,300nits of brightness (for TV models 55"" and up). TheS85Fremains the ""budget"" OLED TV with a Gen 2 processor and is the only model that's available now.
Not yet released
The Frame Pro will make its debut this year alongside the standard Frame TV. The Frame Pro finally features the superior Neo QLED Mini-LED panel for richer and brighter colors, a faster 144Hz refresh rate, the new anti-glare tech, and wireless hookups in the form of a ""One Connect"" box that can be stowed away discreetly. The standard The Frame TV will still be available too, at a significantly lower cost I assume.
Samsung QN90D (2024) Reviewby Jaron Schneider
Samsung’s 2024 mini LED QN90D is a very nice television that refines the interface and adds a host of new features that increase the value of the offering. It’s expensive, but the brightness, color quality, wealth of HDMI 2.1 ports, built-in gaming, and more make a solid argument to warrant the asking price.
Like just about everyone else in the industry, Samsung is going all in on AI. Samsung's new tech for 2025 is their ""Vision AI"", which can recognize the content you're watching, including specifics like the actors or setting, and display relevant personalized commentary in real-time. In addition, more TV models this year will be equipped with AI Upscaling Pro and AI Motion Enhancer Pro which work in tandem to optimize image quality on the fly. Other features include Active Voice Amplier Pro, which uses AI to isolate and enhance voices, AI Optimization, and AI Energy Mode.
Samsung is also decisively moving many of their TV panels to the matte-like anti-glare coating we saw on the S95D in 2024. This anti-glare anti-reflective tech doesn't desaturate like we typically see with anti-glare coatings from other brands, and yet reflections are minimized to the point that you'll never notice them..

"The future of the MCU is starting to take shape. DirectorsAnthony and Joe Russohave teased howAvengers: DoomsdayandAvengers: Secret Warswill differ from their last two projects in the franchise, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.

During an interview with Brazilian outletOmelete, the directing brothers revealed that they see Avengers 5 and 6 as a “new beginning” that will lay the foundation for whatever comes next in Phase 7 of the MCU.
""The greatest thing that ever happened is we got to get immersed in a 20 movie arc and see an ending to that arc,"" Joe Russo said. ""What's compelling about these two new Avengers movies is they're a beginning. It's a new beginning. We told an ending story [with Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame] and now we're going to tell a beginning story. Who knows where we’ll go from there?""
The pair also opened up about how they ended up back in the Marvel world tackling another Avengers story. “We didn’t know what our road forward was in the MCU after we finished Endgame,” Anthony Russo explained.
“What happened was, a creative idea just came to us and that ended up feeling like the right idea. It motivated us to do it again. We feel like we have something fresh, we feel like we have a story that’s important and needs to be told. We have an amazing group of collaborators again, some old and some new. We’re very excited.""
He also noted that Doomsday is a “difficult” movie because of the “expectations on it” to help bring theatergoing back to its pre-pandemic glory. That said, the Russos also revealed it was Marvel producer Kevin Feige’s ideato bring Robert Downey Jr. back for Doomsday.
“That conversation was had a while ago, and Robert tried to talk us into doing it and we said no,” Joe said. “We just didn’t have a story, we didn’t have a way in, so we were resistant for a while. And then one day, [Endgame writer] Steve McFeely called us and said, ‘I have an idea.’ ”
“The only thing I’ll say about the movie is this: we love villains who think they’re the heroes of their own stories,” Joe Russo closed out the interview. “That’s when they become three-dimensional and they become more interesting. When you have an actor like Robert Downey, you have to create a three-dimensional, well shaped character for the audience. That’s where a lot of our focus is going.”
Avengers: Doomsday is currently set to arrive in theaters May 1, 2026 and Secret Wars arrives about a year later in May 2027, so unfortunately, we’ve got a lot of waiting to do before we can see what the Russo brothers are cooking up.
Late last year, Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige teased the introduction of X-Men characters in the ""next few"" MCU movies.
Feige told an audience at the Disney APAC Content Showcase in Singapore that fans would see “some X-Men players that you might recognize” in the next few MCU movies, but he stopped short of saying which characters or what movies.
On bringing the X-Men into the MCU, Feige added: “I think you will see that continues in our next few movies with some X-Men players that you might recognize.
“Right after that, the whole story of Secret Wars really leads us into a new age of mutants and of the X-Men. Again, [it’s] one of those dreams come true. We finally have the X-Men back.”
Feige has also said the X-Men will be an important part of the MCU’s future following Secret Wars. ""When we were preparing for Avengers: Endgame years ago, it was a question of getting to the grand finale of our narrative, and then we had to start all over again after that,” Feige said. “This time, on the road to Secret Wars, we already know very well what the story is going to be until then and afterwards. The X-Men are an important part of that future.”
It sounds like Phase 7 of the MCU will be dominated by the X-Men, then, but in the short term, Storm appeared inWhat If...? Season 3, marking the character’s first appearance in the wider MCU.
In October, Marvel Studios added three untitled movie projects to its 2028 release schedule: February 18, 2028; May 5, 2028; and November 10, 2028. It seems increasingly likely one of these movies is X-Men.

"Friendship opens in theaters Friday, May 9. This review is based on a screening at the 2025 SXSW Film and Television Festival.

Tim Robinson’s character in Friendship is so perfect for his comedic persona, it’s incredible that he didn’t write it himself. It was writtenforhim, to be clear; director Andrew DeYoung said in an interview last fall that he sent the screenplay to Robinson with a note that said he wanted Robinson for the part, and that he planned to shoot it like a Paul Thomas Anderson movie. (More on that later.) Friendless, clueless, and prone to fits of frustrated rage, Craig Waterman is like a character from Robinson’s cringe-comedy series I Think You Should Leave, with about as much depth and equal capacity for laughs.
Craig’s neighbor Austin is a perfect fit for Paul Rudd, too. Austin is a weatherman for a local news station, with a thick mustache, a glorious head of hair, a hot wife, and a successful local garage band. Austin has lots of friends, and likes to have them over for beers on a Friday night. Austin represents a certain type of quietly confident guy, the kind who collects vinyl and drinks craft brews and wears cool jeans that fit him just right. Craig, meanwhile, is neither confident nor quiet. He works for a company that specializes in making apps more addictive, is always holding an awkwardly oversized beverage, and buys all of his clothes from a company called Ocean View Dining.
The only person who can stand Craig is his wife Tami (Kate Mara) – and that comes and goes, frankly. He was the safe choice, a stable presence for Tami and their son Steven (Jack Dylan Grazer). Even so, Craig is inadequate as a provider: A running visual gag involves Tami trying to jam large floral arrangements into a tiny smart car, because Craig can’t afford to buy her a bigger one. He’s inadequate in a lot of ways, actually, and much of the humor in Friendship revolves around Craig’s metaphorical, feature-length cuckolding. His manhood is continually undercut by Tami, by Austin, by the guys at work, by Tami’s sexy firefighter ex, and even by Steven, who has two girlfriends and kisses his mom on the mouth.
Craig reacts like a Tim Robinson character, which is to say that he takes it until he explodes in a fit of impotent rage. Robinson’s comedy is all about inappropriate reactions to ridiculous scenes: Think of the I Think You Should Leave sketch with Tim Heidecker as a condescending, gazpacho-craving boyfriend who populates a game of Celebrity with the un-guessable names of ancient jazz musicians. And that style manifests from Friendship’s opening moments, at a support-group meeting where Tami says that her cancer has been in remission for a year now (this is never mentioned again, by the way) but that there are certain things that still bother her, like wondering if she’ll ever have an orgasm again. Then it’s Craig’s turn to share. “I’m orgasming just fine,” he says.
From there, we pivot to Craig’s burgeoning relationship with Austin, who’s new to the neighborhood and very generous towards the childlike idiot next door. They have a few “good hangs,” exploring the tunnels underneath their small town and foraging for wild mushrooms in the nearby woods. Then Craig humiliates himself at boys’ night, prompting Austin to politely tell him that he’s no longer interested in being bros. This happens a half-hour into this 100-minute movie, making its title somewhat misleading: Most of Friendship is about Craig’s freakout over being friend-dumped, rather than the friendship itself.
A series of escalating absurdist scenarios follow, the funniest of which sees Craig lying on the floor in the stockroom of a cell phone store and licking a toad an 18-year-old named T-Boy (don’t ask) tells him will take him on a mind-bending psychedelic journey. You’ll have to watch the movie to find out where Craig’s mind's eye takes him, but it’s silly and unexpected and gives Robinson the opportunity to have one of his signature tantrums. The surrealist touches in DeYoung’s filmmaking are minimal, but he is fond of the evocative push-ins and Steadicam tracking shots favored by his professed inspiration Anderson, an elevated directing style that feels like a tongue-in-cheek bit in a comedy like Friendship.
Rudd basically disappears after the first act, and Mara literally disappears into the sewers for a few scenes. Robinson’s frequent collaborator (and fellow chronicler of brain-rotted 21st-century guys) Conner O’Malley shows up for a cameo, standing on a chair and ranting about how “we should still be in Afghanistan.” Robinson loses his phone in a puddle, smashes another one against a wall, and ruins several pairs of OVD khakis. His physical-comedy instincts are impeccable, even when the whole thing starts to feel repetitive after a while. (For comparison’s sake: Friendship runs about as long as a full season of I Think You Should Leave.)
The overall effect is of a series of interconnected comedy sketches on the loose themes of manhood and male bonding, which are hilarious if you vibe with Robinson’s style of humor and insufferable if you don’t. Friendship got big laughs at SXSW, leaving a handful of Robinson naysayers alienated and stone-faced in their theater seats. Sounds like the premise for a Tim Robinson sketch.
Paul Rudd and Tim Robinson are both perfectly cast as neighbors – one cool and confident, the other a frustrated loser – in Friendship. The feature debut from director Andrew DeYoung is an absurdist take on the buddy comedy that plays like a loosely connected series of  sketches from Robinson’s Netflix hit I Think You Should Leave. That grows repetitive within a 100-minute timeframe, but DeYoung keeps things interesting with the kind of filmmaking flourishes you’d never see in a streaming sketch series."
"Streaming Wars is a weekly opinion columnby IGN’s Streaming Editor, Amelia Emberwing. Check out the last entryDaredevil: Born Again — An Unexpected Connection to the Netflix Series Could Right a Decade-Old Wrong.

This column contains spoilers for The Walking Dead franchise.
When people bring up The Walking Dead, I always cheerfully change the subject with a simple “I broke up with that show.” It’s dramatic, it’s definitive, and the cheery way I deliver the sentiment is, I suppose, somewhat unnerving. If people pry further, I explain that I loved it, it broke my heart too many times — I will never stop being mad about the pointless death of Beth Greene (Emily Kinney) — and then I left.
See? Breakup. A blissful one that I have never had second thoughts over until The Walking Dead: Dead City. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
There was a time, early on, when almost every dang moment in The Walking Dead was engaging. We were engrossed! The whole world (the whole world that had AMC or applicable streaming services, that is) would tune in every Sunday to find out what was going to happen to the crew. We even tolerated the show treating “we [humans] are the walking dead” as some kind of revelation! It was addictive, right up until it wasn’t. I can go on and on about how shows like The Walking Dead require hope to be interesting, and killing off your only two hopeful characters (Beth and Chad L. Coleman’s Tyrese) back to back with Negan on the horizon (and then somehow makingthatsituation even more bleak) and expecting people to remain engaged is a fundamental writing failure, but that’s not the point here. The point is that I have been blissfully separated from this franchise for adecade,but there is something about the Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Maggie (Lauren Cohen) spinoff The Walking Dead: Dead City that I find absolutelyfascinating.
The trailer for Season 2 of the spinoff dropped this week, pulling the series from the “out of sight, out of mind” section of my brain and reminding me, yet again, to look at this crazy-ass series. Something about the show’s absurd premise of putting a widow on a quest with the man who brutally murdered her husband in cold blood right in front of her is intriguing in a way that grabs my attention every time it comes up.What do you mean Negan and Maggie are working together?
It’s a premise so insane that it manages to outweigh the question of “how the hell does Daryl (Norman Reedus) get to France in the middle of the apocalypse?!” I don’t actually care enough about how Daryl made it to France, or how Carol (Melissa McBride) somehow followed separately, to find out. But I do, for some unfathomable reason, find myself engaged by the idea of Maggie and Negan being forced into what is, perhaps, the strangest team-up in television history. A thought that I have after watching 15 seasons of Morgan’s former series, Supernatural, and witnessing those idiot boys team up with nearly every villain they encounter at one point or another. You’d think that would prepare me for any “working with your mortal enemy situation,” and yet…
Beyond all of that, there’s a scene in The Walking Dead: Dead City’s Season 2 trailer that shows Maggie wielding Lucille, Negan’s treasured bat that was used to brain her beloved husband Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun). That frame alone is enough to ticklemybrain in a way that I start to wonder “what if I gave this spinoff a chance?” before I snap back to reality and remember that way lays endless frustration.
Even still, I have to praise the writers without seeing a single episode of the spinoff. Ideas may be cheap, but engaging an audience up front is not easy, and sparking the curiosity of someone who broke up with your franchise and never looked back is even harder. They have created a premise that intrigues in a way that The Walking Dead has been unable to accomplish in years. So much so that there may come a day where, in a moment of weakness, I hit play on that first episode and give Maggie and Negan’s absurd (platonic) pairing a chance to wow me beyond my initial “damn, that’s interesting.”
Over the years The Walking Dead has remained alivethanks to international views, which has me curious: if you’re in the U.S., have you been watching The Walking Dead: Dead City or any of the show’s other spinoffs? And for the international folks that have remained loyal to the franchise, what keeps you engaged after all these years?"
"So, you might’ve heard this little tidbit of news lately:Stranger ThingsstarSadie Sink is officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the next Spider-Man. But now comes the speculation: who, exactly, will she play in Spider-Man 4?

You’ve got theories, I’ve got theories, and we’re not alone — the whole internet’s got theories. Needless to say, fans' minds are racing. So what do they think? Well, let’s go over the most distinct possibilities (and, for that matter, impossibilities).
It seems as though most folks find the idea of Sink ending up being the, quote unquote, real Mary Jane Watson due to her red hair to be a bit silly. “Michelle Jones isthe MCU’s real MJ,” one fan wrote on Reddit — and most fans in the thread agreed. Though another Redditor noted the studio might cast Sink in the role as a “bold attempt to win back those who prefer classic Spider-Man.” The obvious choice is not always the best one, folks.
Zendayahas played the MCU’s new MJ since 2017’s Spider-Man Homecoming, and despite not being the standard red-haired Mary Jane fans know from the comics andSam Raimi’s previous trilogy, modern day Spidey lovers have generally accepted her as their MJ. So it seems as though they’ll keep her around, especially considering she is said to be, at minimum, coming back for a cameo for this yet untitled sequel toNo Way Home.
Some fans think Sink may end up playing one of Peter Parker’s other love interests, Gwen Stacey. After all, wigsdoexist. “Much to the surprise(and potentially dismay) of everyone,” one user said about Sink in the role previously played by Emma Stone in Marc Webb’s The Amazing Spider-Man duo. “I absolutely would not want to see [that] sincewe’ve already gotten a Gwen Stacy/Peter Parker love storyand I definitely have no interest in seeing Spider-Gwen right now,” another Redditor added.
Spider-Gwen is a distinct part of the animated Spider-Verse, where she is voiced by Hailee Steinfeld, so it seems like fans prefer to follow her story there for the time being. Consideringhow major the Peter and Gwen love story wasin Webb’s Spider-Man films — itdidgive way to a lengthy real-life relationship between Stone and Andrew Garfield, who played Parker/Spider-Man — it makes sense that fans wouldn’t really want to see that rehashed. There’s a ton of Spidey territory to cover between his many comic adventures and appearances, so giving Sink something different to do is most likely the key to making her inclusion a success.
Another theory folks have been throwing around is the idea that Sink might end up playing another famous MCU redhead: X-Men’s Jean Grey, also known as the Phoenix. She was played as an adult by Famke Janssen in five films in Fox’s X-Men franchise. Later, she was portrayed as a teenager by Sophie Turner in2019’s Dark Phoenix.
One user on Reddit considered that idea “too obvious,” while another agreed and added: “Weird to intro [her] in SM4.” That said, a third fan noted that there could always be more castings in the future that could lead tomore mutants joining the fold for Spider-Man 4. Others have doubts about a mutant showing up with true relevance in a Spider-Man focused film. “I just don't seeone of the core X-Men getting introduced in a Spider-Man movie,” a fan wrote.
But it seems as though the most popular guess — and potentially the best guess as well — is a lesser known character called Firestar, a redhead mutant named Angelica Jones who is a mainstay in the X-Men, as well as the 1981 animated seriesSpider-Man and His Amazing Friendswhere she debuted. She could definitely be that “something different” I was talking about — and lots of fans seem excited about the prospect of bringing her into the story as it stands within the MCU.
Indeed, fans seem particularly excited at the idea of bringing those Amazing Friends back together. “She'll be a college student alongside Peter and their friend/partner Bobby Drake. They'll all live in the same apartment too,” one user commented. “This will bethe adaptation of Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends we've all been waiting for, lol.” Another agreed, “I would lovea Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends team-up!” while a third added: “If they did the Amazing Friends lineup,people would lose their minds.”
Firestar started as a Spider-Man character, but eventually broke off and expanded into her own story that included alliances with the New Mutants, Hellions, and the Avengers themselves. So considering her origins, it might just be the perfect character to introduce. However, one fandidmention, “If Firestar, why not Jean?” and to be fair, they have a point. But right now, it’s anyone’s guess who Sink will end up making her MCU debut as. Only time will tell.

"This review contains major spoilers for Severance season 2.

Season 2 of AppleTV+’sSeverancegot off to a bit of a slow start, as it expanded its scope to give more depth to the Macrodata Refinement team and their employers at Lumon Industries. But the back half of the season picks up speed and returns the surreal science-fiction series to its former, compelling self, finally delivering some answers to its core mysteries. Creator and showrunner Dan Erickson’s twisty plot and multi-personality premise allows the cast to truly show their range, while the talent behind the camera – headlined by director Ben Stiller and cinematographer Jessica Lee Gagné – set the bleak tone with their stark footage of empty offices and desolate frozen landscapes.
This season focuses on the conflict between each character’s Innie and Outie self, jumping off from the first season’s brutal battle of wills between the two sides of Britt Lower’s character: Lumon scion Helena Eagan and her counterpart on the severed floor, Helly R. Watching them seek to understand who they truly are – while the Innies weigh their desire to exist against the potential to make things better for themselves and their colleagues – is fascinating.
Helena seizes on Helly’s budding romance with Innie Mark (Adam Scott) to further manipulate Lumon’s most important severed worker while also flirting with his Outie. (It’s as if she’s trying to understand what made a part of her fall in love with him.) Scott has done a phenomenal job throughout the series showcasing the difference between Innie Mark, who typically tries to put on a brave and friendly face to keep his coworkers motivated, and his depressed and sardonic Outie. This season beautifully brings both personas together in pursuit of rescuing Mark’s wife, Gemma (Dichen Lachman), only to tear them apart in episode 9, “The After Hours.” It’s a stunning performance by Scott, as his smugness and earnestness clash when it becomes clear that Mark is just as dismissive of his Innie’s personhood as Helena.
Dylan George (Zach Cherry) earns most improved character honors this season, thanks to a new Lumon perk designed to distance him from his Innie colleagues: the chance to spend time with his wife, Gretchen (Merritt Wever), while he’s still at work. The difference between the brooding, distracted Outie Dylan and his Innie’s delighted awe at getting to know Gretchen is heartbreaking, but the reconciliation between both versions of Dylan makes his arc triumphant. It also creates an example from which the other severed employees might learn to accept themselves.
Romance also factored into one ofseason 1’s highlights, with MDR stickler Irving Bailiff (John Turturro) abandoning his focus on office protocol in pursuit of romance with fellow severed employee Burt Goodman (Christopher Walken). Turturro burns even brighter in season 2: Irving immediately suspects Helly is lying about her time in the outside world and relentlessly pursues that theory, a doggedness that culminates in one of the best scenes of the season. The sacrifice he makes in the moment is stirring; it’s a real testament to the writing on Severance that this moment also contains a clue that pays off in the following episode. The beautifully tragic second act of the Irving-Burt arc that follows allows Walken to show a bit of his signature menace, but his character ultimately redeems himself when he gives the fired Irving an escape from Lumon’s grasp. I hope this isn’t the last we see of Irving; as severed floor manager Seth Milchick (Tramell Tillman) Milchick tells Mark earlier in the season, “I’d hate to reward his courage with nonexistence.”
Season 2 goes deeper on the innies’ supervisors, too, to mixed results. Too much time is spent in the early episodes watching Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette) drive around as she figures out what to do with her post-Lumon life. This feels especially unnecessary following an eighth episode focused on Harmony’s loyalty to the company and everything it took from her – those 37 minutes provide enough explanation of why she would finally decide to help Mark. The Cobel scenes have a less-is-more inverse in the way season 2 illuminates previously unseen facets of Milchick and his struggle to cling to power within an organization that seeks to diminish and belittle him. Arquette is great at vague, menacing sternness, but it feels like there’s more to explore with Tillman’s character as he navigates the absurdity of his job, like when he forces a child to sacrifice her toy just before rushing off to lead a celebratory marching band.
One of the best looking series on television grows even more so in these episodes, tightly linking the style and substance of its dark science fiction. Stiller continues to show he’s a master at creating a palpable sense of isolation and despair in the surreal frozen journey of “Woe’s Hollow” and the desolate company town of “Sweet Vitriol.” But the most perfect crystallization of the show’s aesthetic and tone might be the loop created by Mark’s panicked sprint through the empty halls of the severed floor in the season 2 opening – bookended by the joyous run he takes with Helly at the end of the finale.
After doing so much to shape the visuals of Severance in season 1, cinematographer Jessica Lee Gagné confidently takes the director’s chair for the seventh episode of season 2, “Chikhai Bardo.” The jarring transitions between scenes and themes of love, loss, and memory-tampering recallEternal Sunshine of the Spotless MindandDollhouse, but this is an emotional devastation that Severance can call its own. It’s bolstered by Lachman (speaking of Dollhouse), who demonstrates the kind of passion and wit that would make someone’s former husband want to forget her for eight hours a day. With their positions effectively switching, I’m looking forward to seeing if Gemma will find a way to actually reunite with Mark next season, or if Helly might fulfill her father’s vision and rule the severed floor rather than freeing the people who work there.
Check out ourSeverance season 2 ending explainedfor a rundown of how it wrapped up and where it might go next in season 3.
Though it takes a few episodes to get going, season 2 of Severance eventually helps secure the Apple series’ status as top-tier science fiction TV. These 10 episodes deliver scathing commentary on corporate culture through a surreal, twisty, and deeply emotional story. Time spent developing the supporting cast gives extra resonance to their decisions and behavior in both the Lumon office and the outside world while allowing the cast to show off its range. It’s also one of the most stylish TV shows out there, ending season 2 with a particularly satisfying finale that promises an entirely new normal for season 3."
"Side Quest is now streaming on Apple TV+.

Over the course of four seasons (the most recent of which just ended),Mythic Questhas built a fully realized, ripe-for-exploration universe around the sturdy core of a classic workplace sitcom. This is part of the reason why it’s one of the best, most reliable TV comedies of the streaming era – it doesn’t hurt that the Apple TV+ series set in the world of video-game development is also extremely funny. Hot on the heels of its fourth-season finale comes Side Quest, an entertaining anthology series that delves further into the lives of the people who make, play, and love Mythic Quest’s namesake MMORPG. The parent series has wandered down these kinds of one-off detours several times, and almost always found a worthwhile destination – most notably the first-season highlight “A Dark Quiet Death.” Yet, at a mere four episodes, Side Quest’s expansion pack feels like it ends just as it gets going.
Let’s get this out of the way: Nothing in Side Quest surpasses or even comes close to “A Dark Quiet Death”’s level of quality. It’s never as substantial as that exceptional piece of television, but the spinoff is still a good elaboration on Mythic Quest’s themes of community and boundaries. And while it’s not like Side Quest contains overly complicated links to previous episodes or puzzles to solve, some details will get lost in translation if it’s your first encounter with the fantastical realms maintained by Ian Grimm, Poppy Li, and company.
Of the four episodes, the first, “Song and Dance,” has the strongest ties to the Mythic Quest office: It follows beleaguered art director Phil (Derek Waters) in his continually thwarted attempts to disconnect for a few days. Having appeared in six episodes across seasons 2 and 3, Phil is enough of a fixture that viewers will immediately recognize his downtrodden aura – Ian (Rob McElhenney) has a history of throwing last-minute assignments at him and expecting immediate results. Ian doesn’t respect anyone else’s free time, and as we see in “Song and Dance,” that carries over to Phil’s luxury vacation with his girlfriend Maude, played byPen15’s Anna Konkle.
Thirty minutes of Phil having his time off disrupted by calls from Ian would get stale quickly, so I’m grateful that “Song and Dance” is more about digging deeper into his personal life and psyche. This enriches the Mythic Quest universe: All we know about Phil prior to “Song and Dance” is how put-upon he is, but there’s no interior life in a running gag. We’ve seen Ian cross work-life boundaries before; it might seem like there isn’t any new ground to cover here. But Phil’s low self-esteem adds an extra dimension to the dilemma. Konkle contributes significantly to that feeling, too, hitting notes that are equal parts frustrated and loving – never too smothering, and never too cold, either.
The remaining three episodes distance themselves from Ian and the MQ regulars, which lends some additional novelty to the proceedings. Whereas Mythic Quest has boasted some big-name guest stars in the past – Anthony Hopkins, William Hurt, and Joe Manganiello, to just name a few – Side Quest avoids stunt casting, which suits the types of stories it’s telling. Not to say that this is a cast of fresh faces and newcomers, but there also isn’t anyone whose established star power or fame pulls focus or feels like an odd fit in such humble surroundings.
This also feels in line with the ways Side Quest explores how we form community through art. Games are only one piece of the picture: The second episode, “Pull List,” takes place in a comic-book store. This blind-box stacking, Magic: The Gathering card-slinging spiritual cousin to High Fidelity (the John Cusackmovieandthe Zoë Kravitz Hulu show) is my favorite of the four episodes, but part of me thinks that picking a favorite is a Rorschach Test for your relationship to Mythic Quest. In this case, it underlines how much the ensemble-focused episodes like season 4’s murder mystery, “The Villain’s Feast,” tend to stand out and resonate. (Besides: The more I sit with it, the more my Side Quest ranking changes.)
As the staff and clientele of Comics Galore! trade punchy dialogue about whether Superman or Goku would win in a fight and what characters they claim as Black (Elmo: yes, Big Bird: no), Mythic Quest lore blends deeper our pop-culture world. Written by Leann Bowen and Javier Scott, “Pull List” digs into what makes someone a fan, the pissing matches that sometimes result from trying to prove that fandom, and the growing tension between multiple characters coveting the store’s lone copy of the latest Mythic Quest tie-in comic. It also sets itself apart from the rest of the anthology visually, with playful graphics that pull comic–book imagery into the real world.
Each episode has its own distinct visual identity, but the overall look is still unmistakably Mythic Quest. That’s especially true of the season finale, “The Last Raid,” a screenlife story à laUnfriendedorSearchingdepicting a milestone raid for a long-running guild. In-game graphics punctuate regular Mythic Quest episodes, and here they take center stage as one group of online friends face their greatest test: the way their IRL relationships are developing (or faltering). It’d make a great double feature with the recently released, staging-a-Shakespearean-tragedy-in-GTA-Online documentaryGrand Theft Hamlet: Another sympathetic, nonjudgmental (but still funny) depiction of how video games can be a lifeline for the socially isolated.
Side Quest’s ability to explore so much new terrain through the lens of a single, fictional video game is why I wish it were longer. And while the scope may be there, and all four episodes are engaging and thought-provoking, they ultimately lack the oomph of “A Dark Quiet Death” or its second-season counterpart, “Backstory!” It falls plainly on one end of the Goldilocks principle that plagues many streaming series: Not enough episodes to satisfy our hunger for more Mythic Quest; too slight to stick with you after the credits roll. This is no more apparent than in the third episode, which imparts its message early on but lacks a punch to carry it home. Its story of a cellist learning to separate her passion and her profession (with help from the Mythic Quest score) is sweet, but not much else. Still, it’s a credit to the creative team and performers that I became emotionally invested in all of these characters' lives within the span of 30 minutes. If only there were a few more chances to do so.
It’s no surprise that a Mythic Quest spinoff would be a funny and often heartfelt exploration of community. The four episodes of Side Quest all take on different elements of the MQ universe, tapping into struggles with work-life balance and how a job can consume your life. The first episode eases us with a familiar character, but the three that follow aren’t afraid to delve into new settings populated by unfamiliar faces. It’s an enjoyable and ambitious supplement to one of today’s best streaming comedies – but at only four episodes, Side Quest feels too slight, and unable to reach the high bar set by previous Mythic Quest one-offs."
"There’s no denying the Russo Brothers’ new Netflix filmThe Electric Statehas been the talk of the town since it debuted on Friday — and with the industry’s climate the way it is, fans have certainly been discussing itsuse of AI.

That said, Joe Russo, who alongside his brother Anthony directed Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, has defended the use of AI for voice modulation in The Electric State, claiming it was “something any 10-year-old could do after watching a TikTok video.”
""There’s a lot of finger-pointing and hyperbole because people are afraid,” Joe Russo insisted in an interview withThe Times. “They don’t understand. But ultimately you’ll see AI used more significantly.""
The filmmaker added that he sees potential in the technology. ""Also, AI is in its generative state now, where it has, as we call them, hallucinations. You can’t do mission-critical work with something that hallucinates,” Russo said. “That is a reason self-driving cars haven’t taken over, or why AI surgery is not taking place worldwide. But in its generative state, AI is best suited towards creativity.""
While many artists across a whole host of disciplines feel AI is actually the antithesis of creativity, it seems as though some of the studios are excited to use the tech when it’s ready to be implemented. Back in July 2024, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos claimed thataudiences “don’t care” if AI is used in the film and television programming they watch. Sarandos doubled down and asserted that the tech is ""a great way for creators to tell better stories.""
""Animation didn't get cheaper, it got better in the move from hand-drawn to CG animation, and more people work in animation today than ever in history,"" Sarandos said on the call. ""So I'm pretty sure there's a better business and a bigger business in making content 10% better than there is in making it 50% cheaper.""
For what it’s worth, not everyone seems to be embracing AI right off the bat. Last month,Marvel denied using AIto create teaser posters for the upcomingThe Fantastic Four: First Steps, despite one of the people in the imagery sporting a four-fingered hand.
The Electric State was directed and produced by Anthony and Joe Russo from a script by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, which was loosely adapted from a 2018 illustrated novel by Simon Stalenhag. The movie stars Millie Bobby Brown, Chris Pratt, Ke Huy Quan, Woody Harrelson, Jason Alexander, Anthony Mackie, Jenny Slate, Giancarlo Esposito, Brian Cox, and Stanley Tucci.
IGN'sThe Electric State reviewreturned a 4/10. We said: ""Marvel’s biggest hitmakers join forces again with the Netflix algorithm to deliver The Electric State, a $300-million anti-event movie.""
The Russo Brothers are down to direct the next two Avengers movies for Marvel Studios: 2026's Avengers: Doomsday and 2027's Avengers: Secret Wars.

"This article contains spoilers forThe Studio, and allusion to key plot points inAdolescence, andDaredevil: Born Again.

When a one-shot take begins, unless it’s been part of the marketing campaign for the TV show or movie, you likely don’t know it’s happening. But as that scene unfolds without the use of cuts, it turns into a dizzying magic trick, one that often helps elevate the piece of entertainment you’re consuming to a higher level based on the mere impressiveness of the technique involved. Disney+’s Daredevil: Born Again employed the one-shot with some digital trickery for its premiere fight scene. A week later, Adolescence wowed critics and dominated Netflix’s Top 10 with four intense episodes composed entirely of one shot each. And now, thanks to Apple TV+’s The Studio, we’ve got a hat trick, the perfect capper to this trilogy of March TV one-shots with an episode titled “The Oner” that completely obliterates the wonder of the one-shot take, while miraculously providing a wondrous – and hilarious – 26-ish minute long take itself.
Written and directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the second episode of the two-part premiere of The Studio follows new movie studio boss Matt Remick (also Rogen) and his best friend and VP Sal Saperstein (Ike Barinholtz) as they visit the set of a new Sarah Polley movie, The Silver Lake, starring Greta Lee. Remick is giddy because Polley is filming a “oner,” aka a one-take shot, and as a cinema fan first and film exec second, he wants to be present for possible film history. Unfortunately, nobody else wants him to be there because having the studio boss – particularly one who is a disruptive, nervous wreck like Remick – on set will potentially play havoc with the delicate and time-sensitive nature of filming the shot.
Guess what happens? The episode is spiraling levels of hilarious tension, a perfect storm of brilliantly elevated comedy from expert performers like Rogen and Barinholtz, alongside Catherine O’Hara, Polly, and Lee that starts as a comedy of manners and ends with Remick completely obliterating the set of the movie, Three Stooges style. And that would be fun enough. But thanks to the movie-obsessed Remick, we also get an analysis of what makes one-shot takes work – and not work – as the show itself plays with the form.
That’s the essential trick of the one-shot take, that more often they’re notactuallyone shot. It’s ridiculously difficult to make a scene in a movie or TV show work perfectly even if you’re aiming for a singular shot of one person with a camera locked off on a tripod, let alone hundreds of extras, a moving Steadicam, or any sort of stunts. There are multiple techniques often employed to mask multiple shots to make them look like one shot, to allow more than one take in a “one-take” scene.
Though there are multiple examples of oners throughout history, the most famous example – and arguably the movie that made them famous – is Alfred Hitchcock’s 1948 thriller, Rope. The conceit of the film is that it happens in “real-time,” which is also not true – it’s supposed to take place over 80 minutes when it’s actually 100 minutes long. But Hitchcock shot the film to look like it was one, continuous take when in fact each take is between four and a half to 10 minutes long.
Part of the reason for this, beyond allowing for resetting of scenes, is that Hitchcock was restrained by two issues, both relating to film stock: one, he could only shoot up to 10 minutes at a time on film; and two, the projectionist needed to change reels every 20 minutes. The way Hitchcock accomplished this was by panning past objects, or having objects or people pass by his camera in a consistent manner. Having the camera briefly capture a man’s black jacket, for example, helps mask the cut between one shot and the next because the screen becomes black; and the “space” between one frame of film and another is also black, so the audience won’t notice the cut happening.
Later productions have stretched this further. 1982’s Macbeth filmed a 57-minute long, continuous take. Andy Warhol’s 1964 art film Empire was 485 minutes long, though that did mask the cuts.
And with the advent of the digital age, while we won’t say this has become easier, there are definitely more options. CGI has allowed filmmakers to digitally stitch together shots in a way that hopefully makes them look like one, continuous take. And digital itself has whisked away the issues Hitchcock had, with a shot given the potential to be as long as your hard drive has room for. 2023’s Paint Drying, an experimental film created as a protest to force the British Board of Film Classification to watch the filmmaker’s entire movie, is over 10 hours long.
Given that TV has a long history of live broadcasts, which ostensibly could make a oner relatively easier to achieve, it’s surprising that we haven’t seen more one-shot takes on the small screen; though perhaps the needs of advertising have prevented that, as they’re required to cut to commercials with regularity. But as TV budgets have grown, and streaming has taken over, more film techniques like the one-take shot have moved from cinemas to television. The first season of True Detective employed a six-minute-long tracking shot that wowed critics and fans of the HBO show in 2014. A year later, Netflix’s Daredevil was lauded for a jaw-dropping three-minute-long fight scene the show would top every season… Leading to a masterpiece just under 11-minute one-take scene set in a prison riot in Season 3 of the Marvel series. HBO took back the crown, though, in 2023 for a 27-minute take in a key episode of Succession where Logan Roy’s (Brian Cox) children reacted to his sudden death.
There are plenty of other examples, from an episode of Netflix’s The Haunting of Hill House that uses five seemingly continuous takes to tell the story of Hill House over two time periods, to an episode of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia that shows Charlie Day absolutely losing it over seven harrowing (and hilarious) minutes. Point being, the one-take shot has become part of the language of TV in more recent years in a way that it wasn’t for most of its early history.
Which brings us back to March of 2025, TV’s Month Of Oners. It also raises the question of why we’ve gotten so many one-shot takes over such a short period. The simple answer is that they’re there for different reasons, so in some respects, it’s a coincidence. The more complicated answer is that TV has become so packed with TV shows, that anything buzzy like a one-take shot will hopefully make a series stand out from the pack.
For Daredevil: Born Again, they had done a one-take shot in every previous season of the series. And with the opening episode continuing – and somewhat ending – that story with the initial return of characters Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll) and Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson), it makes sense to havea visual call-outto those stand-out hallway fights from the previous three seasons and put them to rest alongside the law firm of Nelson, Murdock, and Page. While the scene is marred by more obvious digital stitching, it follows Daredevil (Charlie Cox) as he battles Bullseye (Wilson Bethel) through the bar Josie's, into a back room, up a stairway, and onto the roof -- before ending, punctuated by tragedy.
Adolescence’s stunning one-take shots serve a different purpose, beyond being technically impressive. Each hour-long episode is shot in one take without the use of CGI or the panning cuts pioneered by Hitchcock. Instead, the filmmakersfilmed each episode10-13 times, with multiple rehearsals for both actors and the crew. The result is you, the audience, are following the case of Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper), a 13-year-old accused of murdering a classmate, in real-time. The show itself is less concerned with the act thanwhyJamie did it, and how it ties into a culture of toxic masculinity that impacts young boys. By using one take, the show certainly embraces a “voyeuristic element,” but ultimately is about putting you in the same place as the Miller family as they piece together what Jamie did – and the fallout from his actions.
For The Studio, “The Oner” throws all of these techniques in a blender. It not only uses the one-take shot to amp up the comedic tension of the episode, as with the dramatic tension of Daredevil: Born Again, and puts us in the voyeuristic god-seat screaming at Remick to not do what we know he’s going to do, similar to moments in Adolescence. But The Studio episode also works as a de facto teaching tool about one-shot takes, and why they do and don’t work. It’s essentially Rogen and Goldberg doing a victory lap, almost quite literally: the episode begins with Remick and Saperstein driving in the former’s car to set and ends with them leaving the set, creating a visual loop, aka a bookend, something Remick notes he loves midway through the episode.
In the middle, we get brilliant bits like Remick wearing a suit to set, and then changing into an extra’s wardrobe so he can fit in with the more casual vibe, then getting mistaken for an extra later on – ruining the shot. They talk about using whip pans to mask a cut, something Polley says she doesn’t want to do, right as they use a whip pan to mask a cut. And Polley allows Remick on set merely because she desperately wants to include a Rolling Stones song in her movie, which will cost an additional $800,000. Not only does the episode end with them not getting the oner because of Remick’s accidental interventions, but what plays over the end credits? The Rolling Stones “You Can’t Always Get What You Want.”
The whole idea of the one-take shot is summed up early in The Studio episode, thanks to a conversation between the crasser Saperstein, and the more idealistic Remick.
“Oners are just so stupid,” Saperstein says. “It’s just the director jacking off while making everyone else’s lives miserable. Audiences do not care about this shit.”
“Are you kidding me?” Remick answers. “The oner is the ultimate cinematic achievement, you know? It’s like the perfect marriage of artistry and technicality… It’s also like a great storytelling tool, you know? You see Greta Lee’s character go from being confident to broken all in one take with no cuts? That’s perfect, you know?”
Beyond Remick saying “you know” a lot, that sums it up nicely. Saperstein isn’t necessarily wrong, that the prohibitively difficult one-take is a director showing off, as Rogen and Goldberg are doing here. But Remick is also correct that when done right, it is a combination of art and technique that can be used to elevate the storytelling of the episode. When Remick refers to Lee here, he’s of course presaging his own journey from confident studio head to a bloody mess fleeing set in disgrace at the end of the half-hour.
And yes, The Studio episode skewers the pretensions of a one-take shot, as the oner inside the oner doesn’t seem entirely necessary for the movie they’re making. But it also, like every episode of the series, celebrates film-making in all its forms. Rather than the hat trick of one-take shots this month serving as a skewering death knell for the technique, it’s a loving look at why they work. It’s impressive, for sure, from a fight scene in Daredevil: Born Again, to dramatic scenes in Adolescence, to comedic ones in The Studio. But beyond that, it pushes an already difficult task – making a TV show – to its absolute limits, and shows what a small village of people can create if they put their minds to it.
The oner is a magic trick. But it’s also the rare case where knowing how the trick is done – like how we’re shown the gears falling out of the machine on The Studio – it becomes all the more impressive. And at its best, elevates the material. Remick may have ruined the final shot of The Silver Lake, but in the process, Rogen and Goldberg helped make TV history."
"The new Wizarding World is starting to take shape. Casting is currently underway forHBO’s upcoming Harry Potter TV series, and while only a few roles have folks attached, it looks like Potter’s trusty sidekick and Hogwarts groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid is one of them.Shaun of the Deadstar Nick Frost is reportedly currently in talks to take on the role.

That said, HBO released a fairly generic statement noting that it won’t comment on casting decisions unless they’re confirmed. “We appreciate that such a high-profile series will draw a lot of rumor and speculation,”the network explained via Variety.  “As we make our way through pre-production, we will only confirm details as we finalize deals.”
So far, there is only one confirmed role cast for the HBO series:John Lithgow confirmedthat he would be taking on the part of Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts. With Lithgow officially in the mix, fans now have to wait and see if the other rumored casting talks pull through.
Black Mirror starPaapa Essiedu is currently in talksto star as Severus Snape, Hogwarts’ devious potions professor, with Janet McTeer also in talks to join the cast as Minerva McGonagall, the transfiguration professor and head of Gryffindor house. However, unlike Lithgow, Essiedu, McTeer,andFrost have not yet been confirmed — so there’s certainly still waiting to do as the cast continues to grow.
Hagrid was originally played by thelate Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane, who appeared in all eight films.
This week,The White LotusSeason 3 star Jason Isaacs suggesteda surprising pick for who should take over his role as Lucius Malfoy.

"If there’s one actor we’d like to see return forthe Matrix 5, it’s Laurence Fishburne. But unfortunately, it seems as though that might not be in the cards for the legendary actor. He recently revealed that he made himself available for the fourth film,The Matrix Resurrections, but was turned down to reprise his role as Morpheus — so being in the next one isn’t looking so promising.

During a recent appearance onThe View, Fishburne explained that his experience with Resurrections didn’t exactly go as hoped, so it’s anyone’s guess what will happen in the future.
“It depends on the circumstances, who is involved, how well the script has been written. If they offer [it to] me,” the actor said of Matrix 5. “I offered my services to the fourth Matrix, and they didn’t respond well to that. It’s not like I didn’t say, ‘I’d like to offer my services.’ I did. And for whatever reason, that didn’t happen.”
Morpheus is regarded as one of science fiction's best characters, so it’s interesting that the creatives behind the upcoming film wouldn’t have wanted him to return for The Matrix Resurrections, especially considering he appeared in all three original installments.
However, there could be a fairly simple explanation there: Morpheus dies in the MMO gameThe Matrix Online. That specific event in the game is considered canon because the writer-directors, the Wachowskis, gave their approval to the game.
That said, because his death was part of an in-game event, it could very well have been retconned. Instead, Resurrections features Yahya Abdul-Mateen II portraying a version of the character that is actually a hybrid program with Agent Smith created by Neo himself — and also alludes to the fact that the real Morpheus, played by Fishburne, died in the 60 years between the second filmThe Matrix Revolutionsand Resurrections.
A fifth Matrix film is currently in development with Drew Goddard attached to write and direct.

"No video games for you!Superbadco-writerSeth Rogenhas revealed that Sony foundJonah Hill's character so ""reprehensible"" that reps insisted he stay away from aPlayStationduring a video game scene in the now-beloved comedy.

“On Superbad, we were told that Jonah Hill’s character, Seth, was so reprehensible to the studio that they were like, there’s a scene where they’re playing video games and [Sony] was like, ‘Jonah can’t touch a PlayStation,’ ” Rogen told Rotten Tomatoes in a South By Southwest 2025 red carpet video.
“They were like, ‘We can’t have him interact with our products, because it’s too vile a character.’ And I was like, ‘It’s based on me, that’s very insulting.’ But we accommodated them, ultimately.”
Sony Pictures co-financed the film, so they had a lot of leverage over a few top-notch comics trying to make a generational comedy. Ultimately, instead of Hill’s Seth keysmashing his controller and yelling at the TV screen when he died in-game, Michael Cera’s character Evan can be seen playingThe Getaway: Black Mondayon PS2 in that scene. But fun fact: there’s actually a bit of a gag with one of Cera’s lines here. He mentions using an M16 assault rifle in the game — but The Getaway: Black Monday, a British cop game, doesn’t even include them in the weapons arsenal. Go figure.
Rogen was at SXSW to promote his new Apple TV+ seriesThe Studio, which had its world premiere at the festival just days ago.
Superbad also starred Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Emma Stone, alongside memorable cameos from Bill Hader and Rogen himself. Rogen co-wrote the script with Evan Goldberg and Greg Mottola directed.

"I’m not gonna lie: this one stings. Star Wars prequels producer Rick McCallum recently revealed that the legendary cancelled seriesStar Wars: Underworldwould’ve cost a whopping $40 million per episode to make — effectivelydooming it to be axedfor budget reasons.

“The problem was that each episode was bigger than the films,” McCallum explained in an interview onthe Young Indy Chronicles podcast. “So the lowest I could get it down to with the tech that existed then was $40 million an episode.” McCallum added that the inability to successfully realize the project over the years continues to be “one of the great disappointments of our lives.”
With 60 “third draft” scripts written that showcased the Star Wars universe in “sexy, violent, dark, challenging, complicated, and wonderful” ways from “the most wonderful writers in the world,” it seems as though the budget was the true killer in the crib for this project. 60 scripts times $40 million an episode is already well into the $1 billion mark — and it seems as though even George Lucas himself couldn’t scrounge up that kind of cash back in the early 2000s.
“[It] would’ve blown up the whole Star Wars universe and Disney would’ve definitely never offered George to buy the franchise,” McCallum added. The series was truly axedonce Disney took control of Lucasfilmand Lucas stepped aside.
Though McCallum did not confirm any plot details during this interview, fans have long believed that the series would coverthe events between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. The producer previously revealed that the series would featurea whole new cast of characters, would’ve greatly expanded the Star Wars universe, and was targeting an adult — rather than teen and child — audience.
Star Wars: Underworld was first revealed at Star Wars Celebration back in 2005 andtest footage from the serieswas leaked in 2020, but since then, that’s all she wrote. Sadly, it looks as though it may just stay that way.

"Today in weird news,recent Oscarshost Conan O’Brien revealed that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences refused to allow him and his team to clothe an Oscar statue or lay it horizontally for promotional ads they pitched for the ceremony. Uh, who knewthe Academywas so stuffy?

Speaking on his Oscars head writer Mike Sweeney’s podcastConan Needs a Friend, O’Brien set the scene: he pitched a series of ads in which he and a 9-foot tall Oscar statue were in a domestic partnership, but the Academy wasn’t exactly receptive to how he wanted to utilize the statue specifically.
“We’re fighting about things couples fight about,” O’Brien explained of one of his ideas. “At one point, I thought, wouldn’t it be great if it’s just on the couch? Let’s lay it on a really big couch and I’ll be vacuuming and say, ‘Could you at least lift your feet? Or could you at least get up and help? Load the dishwasher?’ We wanted to do it and they just said, ‘No, no no, that can’t happen.’ ”
For such a benign — and generally cute — idea, it doesn’t make a ton of sense as to why the Academy was so emphatic about not doing it. But it turns out they have a few super weird rules for their statue iconography.
“One of the people from the Academy came forward and said, ‘Oscar can never be horizontal.’ And that blew my mind,” O’Brien added. “Like, wow, this is like the thigh bone of St. Peter. This is a religious icon.” The comedian also noted on the podcast that the Academy reps also demanded that the statue is “always naked,” so their idea to have the statue serving O’Brien leftovers as an apron-clad housewife was also a no-go for the organization.
Again, there isn’t much sense in these decisions to the naked eye, but the Academy has a right to them all the same. Still, it’s a bummer we couldn’t see the full breadth of O’Brien’s comedic chops in these promos. Hopefully, he’ll come out of the gate with something equally as witty next year — and yes, we’re Team Conan Oscar Host 2026.

"Thesecond season of The Last of Ushasn’t even arrived yet, but its looming presence is already making a splash.

The show’smost recent trailer for Season 2, which was released during a SXSW panel, has garnered over 158 million views across platforms in just three days, according tonumbers provided by Warner Brothers Discovery. The streamer claimed this is a record for HBO and Max original programming, and that this trailer has outperformed previous promos for the show by “at least 160%”
You can’t stop this.#TheLastOfUsreturns April 13 on Max.pic.twitter.com/DH8UzAugIV
The show seems to only be growing in popularity as fans new and old alike wait patiently for Season 2’s arrival. The Season 1 episodes are averaging “around 32 million cross-platform viewers” domestically, which is a huge jump from the numbers of, say, Season 1’s finale. It racked up an impressive 8.2 million same-day viewers across platforms when it aired in March 2023, according toDeadline. Clearly, folks are excitedly getting ready for the next leg of the story with a little rewatch, but this huge jump in numbers says a lot about just how big this series actually is. It’s definitely one of the most successful for HBO in recent years, but the anticipation and love toward the show is undeniable with numbers like these.
The Last of Us will make a five-year time jump for Season 2, and follow Joel and Ellie as they are “drawn into conflict with each other and a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind.” Stars Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey, Gabriel Luna, and Rutina Wesley are set to return, with heavy hitters likeKaitlyn Dever, Isabella Merced, Catherine O’Hara, and Jeffrey Wright joining the cast alongside them this season.
At the SXSW panel, showrunners Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin confirmed “spores are back” following their omission from Season 1. The trailer teased the introduction of spores after they were left out of Season 1; we see Ellie, played by Bella Ramsey, view an infected whose breath releases the spores.
Druckmann said there is ""an escalation of numbers and types of infected, but also, as you see in the trailer, an escalation of the vector of how this thing spreads"" in The Last of Us Season 2, adding: ""Season 1, we had this new thing that wasn’t in the game of these tendrils that spread, and that was one form. And then one shot you see in this trailer, there are things in the air.""
Mazin later confirmed ""spores are back,"" before Druckmann added: ""The reason [we’re doing it now], I mean, we really wanted to figure it out, and again, everything has to be drama. There had to be a dramatic reason of introducing it now. And there is.""
Season 2 of The Last of Us premieres April 13, 2025 on HBO and HBO Max.

"Boxing legend George Foreman, considered one of the greatest heavyweights of all time and a pop culture icon, has died aged 76.

Foreman became a household name for his exploits in the ring, where he won Olympic gold in 1968 aged 19, and the world title twice, the last of which came in 1994 aged 45. Foreman’s iconic fights include Rumble in the Jungle against Muhammad Ali in 1974. He ended his boxing career with an incredible 76 wins and 68 knockouts, losing just five bouts.
After retiring from boxing in 1997, Foreman went on to become a pop culture and TV legend with his grills. A regular face on television ads, Foreman made millions from his ‘George Foreman Grill’ range and tagline ""Lean Mean Grilling Machine.”
In a post onInstagram, his family paid tribute: ""Our hearts are broken. With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr. who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025 surrounded by loved ones. A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose.
""A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world, He was deeply respected — a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name — for his family.
""We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own.""

"Part of the magic of John Carpenter’s legendary 1982 sci-fi horror filmThe Thingis that the ending is left ambiguous. For the past 43 years, fans have wondered whether R.J. MacReady, played by Kurt Russell, or Childs, played by Keith David, turns into the movie’s central monster at the end, but Carpenter intentionally left fans guessing with absolutely no clues to how things shook down — until now.

The master of horror revealed to Parasite and Mickey 17 director Bong Joon Ho at a special 4K screening of The Thing at the David Geffen Theater in Los Angeles on March 22 thatthere is a “giant hint”in the middle of the film reveals who eventually turns into The Thing at the end of the film. He went on to joke that he would reveal that coveted knowledge to anyone who sent an undisclosed sum of money “in an envelope to my house.”
Carpenter also told the crowd that the actors themselves didn’t even know who would ultimately end up becoming The Thing. “They had no clue,” he admitted. “But they had to play it human, you see. The creature imitates perfectly. It could be one of us, it could be somebody in the audience, and there’s no way of telling. So I knew, they didn’t know.”
As for the hint itself, indie director Joe Russo (notMCU favorite Joe Russo) unleashed his theory on the world via X / Twitter following the screening. “I think I found that hint,”Russo wrote.
Russo noted that MacReady is told about the notion that the creature can replicate at the cellular level, which means that, for their safety, they should only be eating or drinking things that they alone have had contact with. Despite knowing this crucial detail, MacReady shares his liquor with Childs at the end of the film. This could potentially mean MacReady just forgot what he was told, but in Russo’s theory it more likely means he is, in fact, The Thing. ""As soon as Childs drinks from the bottle, The Thing has won,” Russo says. “It’s beaten its most skeptical, final threat.”
Of course, the brilliance of Carpenter’s film is that it ends before any of that is confirmed. But Russo offered further supporting evidence. He noted the last line of the film — ""Why don't we just wait here for a little while, see what happens?"" — is very apropos to the situation if MacReady has already become The Thing. The filmmaker’s thread also has an explanation for the moment we see MacReady kill The Thing: “[Did you see that] OR… did you watch a BETTER imitation kill a POORER imitation because it had a better chance of infiltrating society upon rescue.""
Some fans were definitely swayed by the theory, while others were stuck on the notion that Childs is the one who becomes the creature. ""I still think it’s Childs because we don’t know his whereabouts for a long time heading into the final scene. But Keith David will tell you he’s 100% not The Thing,""one fan added to the thread. Russo replied: ""Carpenter said both actors don't know... Childs always felt like a red herring to me.""
Either way, it’s definitely a theory worth considering. Carpenter still manages to surprise and delight fans all these years later, and we’re lucky to still be getting bits and pieces of his wisdom.

"High hopes, high hopes, Paul Walter Hauser is giving us high hopes.The Fantastic Four: First Stepsis on the horizon, and Hauser is hyping up the movie with some extremely choice words that, if proven correct, might mean this is one of the best MCU films in recent years.

""So I think our movie, Fantastic Four: First Steps, to me, only speaking from my opinion, everything I witnessed and took part in, everything I felt while in the presence of the creatives on the film, I believe we are the Marvel movie of the year,” Hauser, who isplaying a still-undisclosed role in the film, toldTheDirectin a recent interview. “I believe we are the one to watch.""
Hauser, who is starring in the upcoming filmThe Luckiest Man In America, even went as far as to compare the film to two of the most highly regarded MCU outputs ever. ""And I believe that this will go down in history as one of the ones that started a new tide of successful storytelling for the company,” he added. “Sort of in the same way theGuardians of the GalaxyandBlack Pantherhit. They both hit in a certain way. I believe we are about to hit.""
That said, the Richard Jewell actor also noted that, you know, if itdoesend up being bad, everyone has bad days — I mean, movies. ""Let's remember thatMarvel is servicing a lot of folks, and they want to make a lot of entertainment for people to enjoy, and none of us are 100%. None of us hit the mark every time,” Hauser said. “Not a single one of us. Your favorite director has made a less than satisfactory movie. Just facts.""
The Fantastic Four: First Steps went into development shortly after Josh Trank’s 2015 attempt at a reboot film wasless than the big bang 20th Century Fox was hoping for. After Disney acquired Fox in 2019, the movie was moved to Marvel Studios and officially announced in July of that year. Matt Shakman replaced Jon Watts as director in September 2022, and will helm a script by Josh Friedman, Cameron Squires, Eric Pearson, Peter Cameron, Jeff Kaplan, and Ian Springer.
Vanessa Kirby, Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bacarach are set to start as the titular four, with a supporting cast of Hauser, John Malkovitch, Julia Garner, Natasha Lyonne, Sarah Niles, and Ralph Ineson as the villain Galactus alongside them.

In the now deleted video, Sony Interactive Entertainment director of software engineering, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, has a conversation with an AI-powered Aloy via voice prompts and AI-generated speech and facial animations. Raghoebardajal asks Aloy how she's doing, to which she responds: ""Hello, I'm managing alright. Just dealing with a sore throat. How have you been?""
The voice heard coming from Aloy's mouth is clearly not that of Burch, rather a robotic voice similar to those heard from text-to-speech voice generators. AI Aloy's facial movements are stiff and her eyes appear lifeless as she converses with Raghoebardajal.
Burch, who has voiced Aloy in all four Horizon video games released so far (Zero Dawn, Forbidden West, Call of the Mountain, and Lego Horizon Adventures) took to social media platform TikTok to confirm that she had seen the video, and that Horizon developer Guerrilla had got in touch to let her know that the tech demo did not reflect anything that was in active development, nor did it use any of Burch’s performance (facial or voice data). That presumably rules out AI Aloy forthe upcoming Horizon multiplayer game, assuming the character is in the game, and the inevitable Horizon 3. However, as Burch pointed out, Guerrilla (and parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment) owns Aloy as a character.
With all this in mind, Burch said the AI Aloy video left her feeling “worried about game performance as an art form,” and used it as a jumping off point to discuss the ongoing video game voice actors strike that has claimed a number of high-profile casualties in recent weeks.
Last week, the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) issued an update to its members on the status of negotiations over video game actor AI protections, saying that while progress had been made, it was still ""frustratingly far apart"" with the industry bargaining group on key issues.
“Currently what we’re fighting for is, you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form, you have to compensate us fairly, and you have to tell us how you’re using this AI double,” Burch said.
“I feel worried not because the technology exists. Not even because game companies want to use it. Of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements. I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it, that does have someone’s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections, any way to fight back. And that possibility, it makes me so sad it hurts my heart. It scares me. I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances. I want to be able to continue to do this job. If we don’t win, that future is really compromised.
“I’m genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on blast,” Burch continued. “Certainly not Guerrilla. The technology isn’t the problem. Game companies wanting to use the technology isn’t the problem. The problem is we’re currently on strike and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections.
“I support the strike. I’ve always supported the strike. I believe fighting is what we have to do to protect the future and the longevity of this career that we all love so much.”
Burch then pointed to the temporary union contracts that currently give all the protections the striking voice actors are asking for, that any video game company can sign right now. “There’s the interim, the tiered, and low budget agreement contracts available right now for any game company to sign,” Burch said. “I believe we deserve to be protected.”
let us speak on AI aloy
Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI.The game failed, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”
Still, that hasn’t put off a number of video game companies from using generative AI in the development of their products.Activision recently disclosed the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assetsas part of new requirements on Steam, amid a backlash to an ""AI slop"" zombie Santa loading screen.
And the voice actor strike has begun to impact a number of video games. Players have reported that games such as Destiny 2 and World of Warcraft appear to have certain NPCs left unvoiced in otherwise voiced scenes, likely due to the strike. Late last year, SAG-AFTRA struck League of Legends after Riotallegedly tried to subvert the strike by canceling a game in response. And Activision confirmedCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 characters were recastafter players expressed concern about new voices.
Just last week,two Zenless Zone Zero voice actors revealedthey learned they'd been replaced when they saw the game's latest patch notes.
Head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash recentlyweighed in on AI to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamerswho seek ""personalization across everything.""
""For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning.""

"The John Wick anime prequel filmfinally has a confirmed setting.

Announced during CinemaCon, the animated movie will see Keanu Reeves return to voice his character. This is in addition toReeves’ just-confirmed return to the role in live-action form for John Wick 5.
The animated film prequel will tell the story of John Wick’s legendary ‘Impossible Task,’ which is referenced in the movies as helping to create the mythos — and dread — surrounding Wick’s character.
Here’s the official blurb:
It will be produced by the John Wick producing team of Thunder Road’s Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee, 87Eleven Entertainment’s Chad Stahelski, and Keanu Reeves. 87Eleven Entertainment’s Alex Young and Jason Spitz will executive produce.
The film will be directed by Shannon Tindle, an animation veteran who most recently co-wrote and directed the Annie-nominated Netflix film Ultraman: Rising. Tindle also created the double Oscar nominee Kubo and the Two Strings and served as executive producer/showrunner on the Emmy-winning series Lost Ollie. The film will be written by Vanessa Taylor, writer and co-executive producer of Game of Thrones, writer of Divergent, and an Oscar nominee for her work with Guillermo del Toro on the Best Picture winner The Shape of Water.
Adam Fogelson, chair of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group, said: “In both animation and the world of John Wick, the possibilities are endless. And there is no John Wick story fans are clamoring for more than the Impossible Task. Shannon’s take on that story is an incredible one, and we are beyond excited to see what John Wick can do in animation.”
Stahelski added: “I’ve always been fascinated with anime. It has always been a huge influence on me, especially with the John Wick series. To have the opportunity to develop a John Wick anime seems to be the perfect progression for the John Wick world. I feel John Wick is the perfect property for this medium — anime holds the potential to expand our world, our characters, and our action in ways unimaginable before.”
It’s a massively busy time for the billion dollar John Wick franchise. In addition to the already released four mainline films and the just-announced John Wick 5, the John Wick Universe includes two spinoff films (Ballerina, to be released June 6, and a spinoff directed by and starring Donnie Yen reprising his Caine character, set to start production this summer).
In addition, Lionsgate Television produced The Continental: From the World of John Wick for Peacock and Amazon Prime, and Lionsgate confirmed it’s developing the series John Wick: Under the High Table, which Stahelski and Keanu Reeves are executive producing.
Outside TV and films, Lionsgate recently opened an immersive John Wick experience in Las Vegas and has a John Wick AAA video game in the works.

"John Wick 5is official, with Lionsgate confirming the 60-year-old Keanu Reeves is set to return to the role.

The announcement was made on-stage during CinemaCon by Adam Fogelson, chair of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. Development on John Wick: Chapter 5 has begun, with Thunder Road producers Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee, franchise director and producer Chad Stahelski, and star and producer Keanu Reeves all on-board. No release window was offered.
While it makes sense that yet another mainline John Wick movie would be green lit, given John Wick: Chapter 4 took in over $440 million at the worldwide box office and each of the first four films accomplishing the rare feat of outperforming its predecessor, it perhaps does not make much sense when you consider the ending of John Wick: Chapter 4.
Warning!Spoilers for John Wick: Chapter 4 follow.
John Wick appears to die at the end of John Wick: Chapter 4 after, once again, defeating the bad guys. We even get to see John Wick’s gravestone, with Winston (Ian McShane) and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) saying their farewells. But, crucially, we only see John Wick collapse from his injuries andappearto die. I don't remember getting a look at the death certificate, let's put it that way.
So, how can Reeves continue as Wick? We don’t have story details yet, but we do have quotes from some of the people putting the movie together that confirm this is a continuation of John Wick’s story.
Fogelson said: “Keanu, Chad, Basil, and Erica would not return unless they had something truly phenomenal and fresh to say with these characters and this world. We can’t wait for audiences to see where the journey takes us next.”
Iwanyk and Lee added: “It’s so important to get this story right and give John’s story the proper next step. It’s exciting to take the first step on that road.”

"The following is aspoiler-freereview of all seven episodes of The Last of Us Season 2. The first episode premieres on Sunday, April 13 on HBO/Max.

Season one of HBO’s The Last of Uswas a superb retelling of the Naughty Dog game of the same name, both staying loyal to and enriching a beloved story. But season 2 struggles to replicate those qualities – it’s a bleak, abbreviated chapter whose key moments fall flat with too much regularity. It's by no means bad – in fact, at times it’s very good – it just kept me at arm's length, never letting me quite connect to its characters in the way that’s so crucial to The Last of Us Part 2. It's often a spectacle, crafted with skill throughout, but fails to live up to the thrilling heights of its source material or capture the heart of its first season.
If season 1 was about discovering love in the post-apocalypse, season 2 is about holding onto hate, and the more rugged production design reflects this: Fire engulfs snow, melting it away to reveal the fragility of the world these characters inhabit. Five years after Joel (Pedro Pascal) freed Ellie (Bella Ramsey) from the Firefly hospital, we see cities that have fallen apart at the seams, with cult-infused graffiti and showcases of mass murder seemingly on every street corner. It evokes the descent into hell that Ellie goes on, as everything, including the elements, turns against her, with rain pouring and darkness overwhelming sunlight with increasing frequency.
This show is dark in every sense of the word, with little aside from a few dad jokes and the occasional love song to lift the gloom. These moments that puncture through the misery and offer hope are always welcome, though, despite how deliberately eye-rolling the punchlines may seem. They’re at the crux of what makes The Last of Us still compelling, if flawed, television this time around.
I’m not envious of showrunners Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin. Adapting The Last of Us Part 2 and balancing its many reveals with moments of shocking violence and subtle revelations is a highwire act, indeed. Splitting the game into multiple seasons to adhere to a dual-perspective story that delivers its heaviest hammer blows in flashbacks was always going to be a challenge. For what it's worth, I love Part 2, even more than the original The Last of Us, but watching the HBO version has me questioning just how much of that is due to me being able to actively control its two leads, and just how much beingpartof this story is what makes it work.
Those coming in fresh may be as equally floored by the way the story is being told here, but I can’t say it fully works for me. I think this is largely due to some big early revelations emerging about newcomer Abby (Kaitlyn Dever). She’s a less compelling presence when she isn’t shrouded in mystery. As a whole, season 2 feels a little stop-start, a startling cadence where momentum quickly ramps up with one action scene after the next, before grinding to a halt with whole episodes dedicated to reflection and remembrance. And with only seven episodes to play with, it struggles to find its rhythm as a result.
Much like the first season and The Last of Us Part 1, season two keeps Part 2's larger plot intact. The same events still take place, albeit sometimes presented to us at different junctures, with some expanded upon to add context, but never to the extent that Bill’s story was woven into season 1. That’s not to say there aren’t frequent flashbacks  – they’re often parsed out to give extra context to choices being made or emotions being felt. Pascal continues to portray Joel with an excellent, tearful humanity as he learns to live with his fateful actions in Salt Lake City. Ellie is all that matters to him now, and that’s expertly conveyed by Pascal’s eyes, which work overtime in numerous heartfelt conversations with his surrogate daughter.
The jumping back and forth in time is largely successful here, too, filling us in on fresh faces such as Jeffrey Wright’s Isaac – a deliciously performed character who is woefully underexplored in the game. But one episode that takes place almost entirely in the past doesn’t quite work, mainly due to where it falls during the season. The individual scenes are beautifully performed and often tugged my heart in several directions, but it just feels oddly placed in the series as a whole, grinding forward momentum to a halt at a critical point. It then hurtles towards its end in a slightly disorienting fashion, almost deliberately confusing us with fraying threads of subplots leading to other stories that are left dangling.
The quieter moments – Bill’s tragic romance, Henry and Sam’s doomed brotherhood – were my favourite in season one and, thankfully, the same can be said for its follow-up. The problem is they’re fewer and further between this time around. Little time is afforded for contemplation, or to form our own interpretation of the characters’ motives. Instead, everything is handed to us in quite an obvious manner, which is to the detriment of a story that should be slaloming through the grey areas of right and wrong. Catherine O’Hara’s therapist character seems mainly present to be a proxy for the audience, but rather than prod us in the right direction and make us think, she frustratingly delivers exposition dumps concerning the people of Jackson’s internal feelings, rather than letting us form our own assessments.
I fear the pendulum has swung too far from season 1’s scarce encounters with the infected. Hordes and literal avalanches of cordyceps-encrusted monsters descend regularly, especially in the season’s earlier episodes. At one point we’re treated to an almost Helms Deep-like battle sequence in which a flood of infected attempt to wipe out another pocket of humanity; the problem is, this event, although spectacular in its design and execution, overshadows what should be the pivotal moment of the whole season. The catalyst for the rest of its story is reduced almost to a sideshow. It’s a rare miss for a creative team that displayed such elegance in the way it weaved its biggest, most shocking moments into the fabric of season 1.
After a stop-start beginning, the show settles into more of a rhythm (albeit a breakneck one). A familiar feel of deadly road-tripping is resumed, with some of the game’s most threatening foes transferring over to add horror to every dark corner – and providing some of the season’s brightest highlights, too. The midpoint is where it feels most like season 2 is reliving the glory of its predecessor, compared to earlier episodes that strain to fit new characters and Joel and Ellie’s journey into the same spotlight. But The Last of Us gets back on the road soon enough, blending moments of pure horror and touching sentimentality gracefully – episode 4 proved my favourite of the bunch.
The pace skips along too breezily for a supposedly grueling suicide mission into an unknown warzone that’s told over the span of just seven episodes. What should feel like Martin Sheen's long ordeal in Apocalypse Now is presented more like a whistlestop tour of Seattle landmarks. Ultimately, the only hearts of darkness here belong to the many people who have chosen violence as a way of life – a reality seemingly inescapable for any citizen of post-apocalypse Seattle.
Tribalism is at the core of this season, and indeed the core theme that resonates through its source material. Seattle has its warring factions, and Jackson is a tribe all of its own. The problem is that Ellie has never been one for authority, stretching back to her FEDRA training days and subsequent betrayal of the fireflies at the hands of Joel. Personal ties are what powers her choices, and the internal conflict between selfishness and selflessness is keenly explored. This is aided by Ellie’s new friends Jesse and Dina, who are played fantastically by Young Mazino and Isabela Merced, respectively.
Gabriel Luna is the early episodes’ MVP. His Tommy is the rock of Jackson: tender but strong, and the cool to his often hotheaded and impulsive brother, Joel. But it’s the charismatic Merced who’s the star of the show in season 2. As Dina, she’s a great source of warmth and humour throughout – as much as can be found in this world, anyway. A fun (bordering on jarringly quippy) foil to Ellie, she gives as good as she gets but also stands strong in their many encounters with Clickers and other such threats. (And when the time comes, she knows to just run away, too.) Between this andAlien Romulus, she’s proven that she’s perfectly at home being chased by monsters.
Bella Ramsey was fantastic as a younger version of Ellie, but their performance in season 2 didn’t really sell me on the fact that five years have passed in the world of The Last of Us. Ellie just doesn’t appear to have matured, and it sits strangely next to the very mature content of season 2. Ramsey acts with more physicality, displaying impressive combat skills, but still behaves like a child in conversation. They’re great most of the time, but in the flashes of rage they’re asked to present, it feels slightly off –  especially now that Abby is around: In the brief moments we spend with her, Kaitlyn Dever is a force. Ramsey mostly remains a strong interpreter of Ellie, and they’re superb at the precocious, cheeky side of the character, but upstaged by Dever in the show’s more heated moments  – she’s simply able to deal a more ferocious shade of heat.
On a production level, The Last of Us remains a near-faultless display of prestige television. Beautifully shot, it captures both the scale of the depravity taking hold over nature and presents both the beautiful and horrific details that inhabit it. The lighting stands out in particular: Sentimental moments are drenched in warm sunlight, while horror is often (and appropriately) bathed in blood-red hues or hand-lit by the flame of stalking threats. At its best, the atmosphere sparks images of Ben Wheatley's thriller-come-folk horror masterpiece, Kill List, as it merges modern architecture with thoroughly medieval, violent practices – an ominous, cultlike religious group introduced in season 2 only adds to this air of doom.
But this is a story barely half-told, and as such is hard to evaluate. The further into Seattle we get, the more we’re getting scraps of things we won’t see in their entirety until later on. It could be that by the end of season 3, these seven episodes feel like an exciting piece of a greater whole. The problem is, this is television, and we’ll have to wait many months, if not years, for those gaps to be filled in. I fear, for all that makes season 2 worth recommending, it will leave a lot of people bewildered rather than intrigued. I ultimately respect the decision to largely stick with the game’s structure – it's part of what makes the steady reveal of its story and our evolving sympathies towards its characters such a masterstroke. I’m just wary that the effect hasn’t translated all too well here.
It was always going to be a challenge to adapt The Last of Us Part 2’s sprawling, twisting story into a television show across multiple seasons, and at the halfway point, the jury is still out on whether it will ultimately work. Season 2 of HBO’s Naughty Dog adaptation is not bad television, far from it. It’s incredibly well-made, often looks gorgeous, and is packed full of stellar performances. But the storytelling devices and choices made in terms of pace and placement for key events bump up against what works, ultimately not delivering the striking effect this story’s undeniable shocking events should. It’s good, just not a patch on its stellar source material (or its first season) so far."

"Speculation thatStarfieldwill soon be confirmed for release on PlayStation 5 ramped up over the weekend after fans spotted a PlayStation logo on Bethesda’s official Creations website.

The logo was attached to a work-in-progress ship decals Creation for Starfield, and although the Creation was removed, fans are speculating that Bethesda’s so-far PC and Xbox-only sci-fi game is soon set for PS5.
Thoughts inevitably turn to whether Bethesda plans a significant content update, possibly even a new expansion, to coincide with Starfield’s seemingly inevitable release on PS5. There’s been little to shout about when it comes to Starfield in recent months, following the launch of the poorly receivedShattered Space expansion. Bethesda parent company Microsoft is expected to hold another summer showcase this year, as it has done in recent years, and that event may be the right time and place to learn more about all things Starfield.
Bethesda itself has said it has ""exciting things"" planned for Starfield this year, amid growing discontent from players about a lack of communication and updates. In June 2024,Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supportingStarfield, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. In an interview withYouTube channel MrMattyPlays, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”
Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new intellectual property in years, and its first mainline single-player game since Microsoft bought parent company ZeniMax Media in March 2021. IGN’sStarfield reviewreturned a 7/10. We said: “Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist.”
In January,Microsoft’s gaming boss Phil Spencer refused to rule out Starfield coming out on PS5.Starfield and MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were both reported as being considered for PS5 as far back as March 2024. Indy ended up confirmed for PS5 with a spring 2025 release window, a few months after its release on PC and Xbox Series X and S. But Starfield is yet to be confirmed for PS5, although Spencer's comments certainly suggested it was on the cards.
A number of Xbox games are currently available on PS5, including Rare’s Sea of Thieves, Tango Gameworks’ Hi-Fi Rush, and Obsidian’s Grounded and Pentiment. Microsoft already publishes Minecraft games on PlayStation consoles, among many other platforms, and is set to publish Doom: The Dark Ages and Ninja Gaiden 4 on PS5 later this year. Playground’s Forza Horizon 5 is also confirmed as coming to PS5 soon. There are even reports thatMicrosoft is finally ready to release Halo on PlayStation after decades of Xbox exclusivity.
Spencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.
“We run a business,”Spencer said in August last year. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.
“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”
It’s a busy time for the 450-person Bethesda Game Studios, which currently operates five teams: Starfield; Elder Scrolls 6; Fallout 76; mobile; and external development partnerships.

"Fans quick to celebrate the reveal of a Microsoft Flight Simulator PlayStation Store page were left let down after it was discovered that the actual product is little more than “copycat shovelware.”

Xbox and PlayStation fans gathered to discuss a potential port for the popular flight simulation game afterReddit user CreativeRaspberry314 sharedTrophy information related to a potential PS4 and PS5 version earlier today. It would be exciting – ifnot somewhat unsurprising– to see Microsoft bring more Xbox titles to PlayStation fans, butthe spotted store pageisn’t officially related to Microsoft Flight Simulator in any way, shape, or form.
“Sadly, this is just a copycat shovelware game,” oneReddit user added. “Straight up shovelware,” anotheradded. “Actually mental tbh, the picture is a straight up rip-off. If it was MSFS, it'd have the same achievements as the Xbox/Steam versions.”
Instead, the Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation is being published by a company named Grizzly Games Limited. As spotted byEurogamer, the company shares a name with Thronefall developer Grizzly Games but is also completely unrelated to that entity. While that team is responsible for other titles like Superflight and Islanders, theGrizzly Games Limited websitereveals a catalog of what appear to be mobile games featuring glossy, AI-generated materials. The art for its Flight Simulator 2025 project also appears to be generated by AI judging by some of its muddy plane parts and strange designs.
The Thronefall team, meanwhile, provided a statement to Eurogamer related to the discovery of Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation and Grizzly Games Limited. Grizzly Games says it is not associated with the company, adding that it is using “both our name and logo illegally.”
“Furthermore they seem to incorporate the absolute opposite of our values, of what we stand for and what we’re trying to give to the gaming community,” Grizzly Games continued. “Unfortunately our legal resources are limited as a two-person indie team, but honestly I'd love to see this kind of stuff being stopped, especially since it's not only happening to us but lots of indie devs that just lack the legal power.""
As of this story’s publication, the Flight Simulator 2025 page remains live on the PlayStation Store. It describes an experience that “sets a new standard in aviation simulation, combining ultra-realistic flight dynamics with breathtaking visuals.” No gameplay for the project has been revealed.
“Can shovelware just be banned from the store please? It’s packed to the brim with it and makes browsing an absolute chore,” anotherReddit user added. “I don’t remember it being this bad in prior generations.”
PlayStationtook a standagainst what many refer to as “spam” titles in 2022. At the time, it was believed the move was made to fight back against easy-to-Platinum games, or titles that exist almost solely for the purpose of increasing players’ Platinum Trophy count. However, many shovelware titles still exist on the PlayStation Store andother digital storefrontstoday.
Webrought a magnifying glass up to the issue last monthto take a closer look at how shovelware titles impact both gamers and developers. We spoke to multiple developers to learn more about not only how these games find their way onto digital storefronts but PlayStation, Nintendo, Xbox, and Valve’s vetting process.

"There is enormous pressure onAssassin's Creed Shadowsto do well for Ubisoft globally after a number of delays and the sales failure of last year’sStar Wars Outlaws. Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number ofhigh-profile flops,layoffs,studio closures, andgame cancellationsin the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release.

Things have got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family isreportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investorson a buyout deal that would let it preserve control of the company's intellectual property.
So, the video game world is watching Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ early performance closely for signs of its success — or failure. So far, Ubisoft has yet to announce a sales figure, but has saidAssassin's Creed Shadows hit 2 million players just two days after launch, surpassing the launches of both Origins and Odyssey.
There’s also a lot of attention on Shadows’ Steam concurrents, which are being compared to those of other triple-A single-player games that recently released, as well as previous Assassin’s Creed games on Valve’s platform.
Shadows became the most-played Assassin's Creed game ever on Steam over the weekend with 64,825 peak concurrent players, although it’s worth noting that it was the first game in the series to launch day-one there since 2018's Odyssey. BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardsaw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.
It’s hard to make a call on whether Shadows is below, meeting, or exceeding Ubisoft’s expectations without knowing what those expectations were. But a source from within Ubisoft, who revealed an internal email reviewed by IGN, has helped us better understand the game’s first weekend performance.
Here’s what we’ve found out: Shadows delivered the second-highest day-one sales revenue in the franchise’s history, behind only 2020’s Valhalla, which launched across the last and current generation of consoles and benefited from stay-at-home gaming fueled by the pandemic.
Shadows also marked Ubisoft’s best ever day-one launch on the PlayStation Store, suggesting particular success on PS5.
But what about PC, given Shadows launched on Steam as well as Ubisoft’s own digital store? According to Ubisoft’s internal communication, 27% of Shadows’ total “activations” were on PC. Ubisoft is telling employees that Steam “played a major role” in Shadows’ performance on PC, without revealing exact sell-through numbers. It says early results “are a strong validation of our decision to return to the platform.”
Generally, Ubisoft is talking up player engagement, which is at “record levels,” and “feedback across moderated, verified platforms — those less affected by review bombing — remains incredibly positive.” Shadows was also the most-wishlisted Ubisoft game of all time, and it’s doing better than any other Assassin’s Creed game on Twitch, even Valhalla.
It’s here that Ubisoft’s internal communication provides context on comparisons between Shadows’ launch and other games in the franchise. What’s clear is that Shadows is not doing as well as Valhalla did at launch, but Ubisoft is saying it’s not fair to compare the two, because Valhalla benefitted from the “perfect storm” of pandemic-fueled stay-at-home gaming and the launch of the Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5 in 2020.
“Valhalla launched under extraordinary conditions — in the middle of a global pandemic, with widespread lockdowns and brand-new console hardware,” the internal communication reads. “It was a perfect storm we may never see again. That’s why it’s more meaningful to compare Shadows to entries like Origins, Odyssey, and Mirage — games released in more typical cycles. And in that frame, Shadows is already setting a new bar as illustrated above.”
Ubisoft also pointed out that Shadows released in March. Historically, Assassin’s Creed games launch just ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving window, which typically boosts sales. Meanwhile, Ubisoft ditched the early access period it normally charges extra for with its games. It’s also worth noting that Ubisoft’s own subscription offering is now available directly on Xbox, which affects sales on Microsoft’s console and muddies sales comparisons.
Money talks, of course, and irrespective of player numbers and engagement, it will be revenue brought in by Assassin’s Creed Shadows that determines the fate of not just the game, but Ubisoft itself. We may not get a clear picture of that until Ubisoft's next financial report in the coming months.

"The Nintendo Switch 2 arrives on June 5, 2025, and it will likely be a hot commodity when it launches. Over on the official Nintendo store, the company is implementing some pre-order measures to ensure bona fide Switch players are getting their pre-orders.

On theMy Nintendo Store, those with a Nintendo Account can register their interest in pre-ordering a Nintendo Switch 2 system and ""select accessories"" from the Nintendo Store. Those who express interest will then get an invitation email once their turn in line comes up, valid for 72 hours. The catch? You'll need to have put in some time on your old Switch, and been a Switch Online member.
""Invitation emails will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis to registrants who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025,"" according to the fine print on the site.
Nintendo also notes that invitations are ""non-transferable"" and will be sent to email addresses associated with the Nintendo Account that registers interest. For the system and each accessory, there will also be a one-per-account limit during the invitation period. Currently on the site, you can express interest in either a base Nintendo Switch 2 system, or the one bundled with Mario Kart World.
Orders will be shipped after purchase, and the approximate shipping date will be provided when ordering. Nintendo also specifies: ""Please note that release-day delivery is not guaranteed due to processing and shipment times.""
While not said outright by Nintendo, all of these measures seem dedicated towards ensuring that someone buying a Switch 2 through this process is someone who wants to purchase and play a Switch 2 for themselves, rather than flip it online.
Scalping has been a frequent problem for new releases of sought-after products. Notably, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S sawscalpers pursuing the new hardware, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game hasbeen dealing with ongoing scalping and shortages.
Valve found some success in its queue system for the Steam Deck, utilizing a method that tied Steam accounts to purchases alongside checks for whether an account was made before, or after, a certain window.It worked, and it's not surprising now to see Nintendo taking similar measures with the My Nintendo Store process.
Of course, there will be other ways to pick up a Switch 2. But hopefully options like this can help some long-time Switch 1 owners avoid the potential chaos of locking down a launch day Switch 2 pre-order.

"As a part of Microsoft's ongoing efforts toimplement artificial intelligence into basically everything, the company is preparing to introduce its AI Copilot into your Xbox experience to give you gaming advice, help you remember where you left off last time you played, and perform other tasks.

Announced today, Copilot for gaming will be rolled out for Xbox Insiders through the Xbox mobile app sometime soon for testing. If you're not already aware, Copilot is Microsoft's existing AI chatbot (that replaced Cortana in 2023) that's already integrated into Windows. The gaming version will have a handful of features at launch. You can ask it to install games on your Xbox for you (a process you can already do now just by pushing a single button on the app), and you can also ask it about your play history (in case you forgot what you were doing last time you played), achievements, library, or for a recommendation of what to play next. You'll also be able to speak to Copilot for Gaming directly on the Xbox app while you're playing, and it will serve you answers in the same way Copilot currently does when asked questions via Windows.
Probably the biggest use-cases touted by Microsoft available at launch is Copilot as a gaming assistant. You can already ask Copilot questions about games any time on PC, such as how to beat a boss or solve a puzzle, and it will source answers via Bing from various online guides, websites, wikis, and forums. Soon, you'll also be able to ask it those same questions on the Xbox app.
""Our goal is to have Copilot for Gaming source the most accurate game knowledge — so we are working with game studios to make sure the information Copilot surfaces reflects their vision, and Copilot will refer players back to the original source of the information.""
Unshockingly, Microsoft does not intend to limit itself to just these Copilot functions. In a press briefing, Microsoft spokespeople discussed other future possibilities for Copilot in video games, including as awalkthrough assistant to explain basic game functions, remember where items where left in a game, or tell you where to find new ones, or as a helper in competitive games that could offer strategy suggestions and tips in real-time to counter opponents' moves, or explain how and why an engagement unfolded the way it did. Though it was emphasized that these were both just ideas they were toying with, the presentation made clear that Microsoft is insistant on finding ways to integrate Copilot closely with regular Xbox gameplay. And Microsoft confirmed to me that it will eventually work with not just first-party studios, but third-party studios for integration into their games as well.
With that in mind, I asked Microsoft if Copilot gaming would be opt in or opt out of use, or if users could opt out of having their data used to train it. The answer is that yes, Xbox Insiders can opt out during the preview, but the door was left open for Copilot to be mandatory in the future. Here's what a spokesperson said:
""During this preview on mobile, players will be able to decide how and when they want to interact with Copilot for Gaming, whether it has access to their conversation history, and what it does on their behalf.
""As we preview and test Copilot for Gaming with players early, we will continue to be transparent about what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices players have around sharing their personal data.""
IGN understands that Copilot is not being limited to just player-focused usage, and that Microsoft will be providing an overview on plans for developer use in asession at the Game Developers Conference on Monday next week.

"Control was IGN’s Game of the Year in 2019 – and I was one of the many editors that voted for it – but even I was skeptical when Remedy, a studio known for telling great single-player stories in third-person games, announced it was doing a Control multiplayer game. That project turned out to be FBC: Firebreak, a three-player PvE first-person multiplayer shooter set six years after the events of Control. And in the hands-off demo I saw, it very quickly became clear that my skepticism was completely unwarranted. Firebreak is refreshingly original in an oversaturated space, delightfully weird amidst a sea of same-y military and/or sci-fi online shooters, and perhaps best of all, it doesn’t require a massive commitment like so many of its contemporaries. As game director Mike Kayatta put it, ""We're not about daily check-ins. We're not interested in monthly grinds. We don't want to give anybody a second job."" Say it again, Mike, for the people in the back.

FBC: Firebreak is a three-player co-op FPS with, if what Remedy is promising comes to pass, no nonsense. You can play for 20 minutes or a few hours if you want to, with Perk unlocks and new combinations amongst characters keeping things fresh for repeat runs. But what the heck are you doing here, back in The Oldest House, with a bevy of bizarre weaponry in your hands? Essentially, you are volunteer first responders in The Oldest House when things go seriously sideways. Your characters are secretaries, rangers, and other “normal” occupations who heed the call of service. The Federal Bureau of Control wouldn’t say you’re expendable, but…you’re expendable.
When you log in to play, you choose a Job (aka a mission) and a Crisis Kit (essentially, your loadout) before setting the Threat Level (difficulty) and Clearance Level, which determines how many zones you'll be playing through in a run. The zones are separated by containment doors, which will take you to the next stage of the Job. And the Job I saw is called Paper Chase, and it’s set in a fairly mundane office section of the FBC building. The Hiss are spreading, and it’s up to you and your two teammates to work together to beat them back.
Of course, you can get the hell out of there as soon as you can if you like, but if you want to get your hands on currencies that let you upgrade and buy new gear, you have to escape safely with them. And the longer you spend exploring for currency, the harder it is to make it back to HQ in one piece.
Speaking of gear, that’s where FBC: Firebreak starts to set itself apart from other multiplayer shooters. Many of the guns are charmingly unusual, and most have a homebrew feel, like the hand-cranked snowball-launching gun that can put out fires (or your friends who are on fire) and soak the sticky-note monster (uh, more on him in a bit). Or the cobbled-together zapper that, when fitted with the right nozzle, can rain down lightning storms on a room full of bad guys. Or the large wrench that, when a squeaky piggy bank toy is attached, causes a swirl of coins to pelt your opponents. Don’t worry, though; there are still staples like a machinegun and shotgun – the latter of which is the go-to for after you’ve either soaked or zapped one of the sticky-note monsters.
Oh yes, about them: the entire point of this particular Job is to eliminate all of the sticky notes before they overrun the entire brutalist building. Note the number of sticky notes left to destroy in the upper left corner. It will actually go way up as the mission progresses because, by the end of it, you face off against…a gigantic sticky-note monster. Think Sandman from the end of Spider-Man 3, but made out of sticky Post-It notes instead of sand.
But it’s not just about weird weapons. There are also fun in-universe gameplay mechanics, too, like the office supply shelf that refills your ammo, the makeshift turret you build after literally dumping it out of a box onto the floor, the stereo speaker that keeps the Hiss at bay, and the rinse station that washes any aggressive sticky notes off of your face. Unlockable Perks also inject more spice and variety into the gameplay. A couple of examples I saw: a Perk where each missed bullet has a chance to return to your clip, and another that lets you extinguish yourself by jumping up and down. Also, if you get two of the same Perk you get a stronger version of it. If you get three, you can share the Perk’s effect with nearby teammates.
By the way, in case you’re wondering, you don’t have to have three people in order to play. You can play solo or in duos as well. Meanwhile, Remedy is aiming for a lower minimum PC spec than usual, but on the opposite end of the spectrum, FBC will also support DLSS4 with multi-frame generation as well as nVidia Reflex and full ray-tracing. It’ll also be Steam Deck verified, and it’s launching into Xbox and PC Game Pass on day one along with PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium. Finally, there is a post-launch content plan that Remedy isn’t ready to share quite yet, and there will be paid cosmetics, but that’s the extent of the microtransactions.
In fairness, I haven’t actually played FBC: Firebreak yet, so I have to be cautious about my enthusiasm. But so far, it certainly passes the eye test. This is almost certainly not a run-of-the-mill multiplayer shooter, in a very good way. And the fact that it’s a get-in and get-out online game that doesn’t require a massive ongoing time commitment in order to enjoy it is a refreshing throwback to the days when that was the norm.

"One of the best 55"" OLED TVs is on sale for a limited time. Walmart is offering a55"" Samsung S90C 4K OLED Smart TVfor just $989 with free shipping. Beach Camera is the marketplace vendor and it is an authorized Samsung reseller, which means you get the full manufacturer's warranty. The S90C is a 2023 model, but it's a better TV than the2024 S85Dand nearly identical in image quality to the2024 S90D, which is currently selling for $200 more. Ideally you'll pair it with yourPlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or even theupcoming Switch 2 console.

Update:This TV is also available onAmazonfor a little more.
The Samsung S90C is a slightly older 2023 model (superseded by theS90Dfor 2024), but it's still considered to be one of the best OLED TVs available. That's because the S90C uses Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. It's generally considered better than LG's ""Evo"" technology found on the C-series TVs, which attempt to do the same thing. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. At the moment, there's no better panel technology that's readily available at a reasonable price.
OLED technology aside, the Samsung S90C also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz (rare in a 2023 TV) as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. The S90C also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode.

"A Black Friday deal on one of the best OLED TVs is back. Starting today,AmazonandSamsungare offering the 2024 65"" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV for only $1,399.99 shipped after $1,300 in instant savings. This is anexcellent TV to pair up with your PlayStation 5or Xbox Series X. This TV is considered to as good as or better than the popular LG C4 OLED TV. According toRTINGS, the Samsung S90D is a brighter TV with a wider color gamut, better color volume, wider viewing angle, and better HDR gradient handling.

The Samsung S90D is the current generation 2024 model. A new ""S90F"" model was announced during CES 2025, but it has yet to be released. This TV is equipped with Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times.
OLED technology aside, the Samsung S90D also has all the features you'd want in agaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming console. The S90D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to the recently releasedPlaystation 5 Proconsole since it can drive more games in quality mode (native 4K @ 120fps) than the standard PS5, which often needs to be set to performance mode (upscaled 4K).
If you're looking for a smaller size, the 42"", 48"", and 55"" models are also on sale. The 42"" model is ideal for PC monitor use. At that screen size, the 4K resolution equates to a respectable 104ppi pixel density and supports chroma 4:4:4 subsampling for clear, legible text. The HDMI 2.1 input supports refresh rates of up to 144Hz over 4K resolution.
For this week only, Best Buy is offering the 77"" Samsung S84D 4K OLED smart TV for $1,499.99. That's only $150 more than the 65"" S90D model for a 40% larger screen size. The S84D is Best Buy's exclusive model that's identical to the S85D but with slightly better speakers (30W vs 20W). Compared to the S90D, the S84D is a step down in image quality since it doesn't utilize quantum dot technology and the refresh rate is limited to 120Hz instead of 144Hz. However, it's still an outstanding TV compared to other TVs on the market and an excellent value at this price.

"Here's your chance to get a massive, top notch OLED TV at one of the lowest prices we've seen, especially for a recent Samsung model. Right now, both Best Buy offering the83"" Samsung S85D 4K OLED Smart TVfor just $1,799.99 with free delivery. This is such a big discount that even the next size down (77"") at this price would have been a good purchase. This is anexcellent TV to pair up with your PlayStation 5or Xbox Series X since it has HDMI 2.1 inputs and supports 4K gaming at up to 120Hz.

The Samsung S85D is the most affordable TV in Samsung's 2024 OLED lineup. Unlike the higher-end S90D which uses a quantum dot OLED panel (and costs $500 more), the S85D uses a standard W-OLED panel. In terms of image quality, it's directly comparable to the LG B4 OLED TV (which costs $200 more). Since this is a true OLED panel, the S85D boasts near instantaneous response time, near infinite contrast ratio, and true blacks. It's superior to any other panel type for most use cases. For those of you who are concerned with burn-in, it's rarely an issue with OLED TVs; it's more of a concern with computer monitors where static screens (like your desktop) are more common.
The Samsung S85D also has the necessary features you'd want in a current-gengaming TV, like HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 120Hz panel forrunning 4Kat 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. The S85D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to thePlaystation 5 Proconsole, since it has the power to run most games in true 4K resolution (vs upscaled 1440p in ""Performance"" mode) at 120Hz.
Right now this is the lowest price we can find for a brand new and fully warrantied 65"" OLED TV, especially if you want to stick with a tried and true brand like Samsung. If you're wondering how this TV stacks up to the new 2025 OLED TVs, it looks like most of the improvements are incremental: highlights include a slightly faster processor or better anti-glare coating. The panel technology is largely identical to 2024 models.

Release Date:March 28, 2023
When there's a red version, there's almost always a blue version to accompany it.Released alongside its Red-hued counterpart, the Blue Elite Core controller features—you guessed it—a blue faceplate, matching buttons, and black grip.
If standard and special edition controllers don't tickle your fancy, Xbox is no stranger to limited edition controllers either. Since the launch of the Xbox Series X|S, there have been a number of limited edition controllers for Xbox games such asForza Horizon 5,Starfield, aHalo Infinite-themed Elite Controller, and  most recently, a special edition controller for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.
There have also been some...odd choices to say the least. In 2022,Xbox held a sweepstakes to win furry Sonic-themed controllers to promote Sonic 2, as well as somecheekydesigns featuring Deadpool & Wolverine's literal asseson the back of the controller.
Some other newsworthy controllers include anenvironmentally-conscious controllermade from recycled plastics and ground-up Xbox One controller parts, a transparent black controller tocelebrate Xbox's 20th anniversary, and another entry in the ""Vapor series"" thatcaused Xbox to come under firefor it's poorly-timed tagline.
Arguably the biggest controller announcement during the Series X|S generation, though, is thereturn of Xbox Design Labin 2021. Not only can you customize your perfect controller, but you can also create exclusive designsfeaturing popular franchises like Falloutand Call of Duty.

"Ubisoft has hailed anotherAssassin’s Creed Shadowsplayer milestone, but has yet to confirm a sales figure for the game.

In asocial media post, Ubisoft said Shadows has seen 2 million players since going on sale on March 20, up from the 1 million on day one.
That’s enough to surpass the launches of both Assassin’s Creed Origins and Odyssey, Ubisoft added. “Thank you for joining the journey in Feudal Japan!”
It’s an impressive start for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but it’s worth bearing in mind that Ubisoft has yet to announce a sales figure for the game. Still, we do know it’s the top-selling game on Steam, where Ubisoft recently returned after years of PC launch exclusivity on the Epic Games Store.
At the time of this article’s publication, Assassin’s Creed Shadows was on 58,894 concurrent players on Steam, enough to break into the top 30 most-played games on Valve’s platform. That peak is expected to rise as we continue into the game’s opening weekend.
For comparison, Origins’ all-time Steam peak was 41,551, over seven years ago, and Odyssey’s was 62,069. It seems likely Shadows will become the most-played Assassin's Creed game on Steam later this weekend.
BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardlaunched on Steam on Thursday, October 31, 2024, and saw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.
The true concurrent peak of Assassin’s Creed Shadows will of course be much higher, given it launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S also. Neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.
There is enormous pressure on Assassin's Creed Shadows to do well for Ubisoft globally after multiple delays and the sales failure of last year’sStar Wars Outlaws. Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number ofhigh-profile flops,layoffs,studio closures, andgame cancellationsin the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release. Things got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family and largest shareholder arereportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investorson a buyout deal that would let them preserve control.
Assassin's Creed Shadows has also endured a number of controversies itself, not least in Japan. This week, IGN confirmed thatUbisoft had quietly released a day-one patch for Assassin’s Creed Shadowsthat made a number of important changes seemingly in response to concern from some Japanese politicians about in-game temples and shrines.
In a remarkable exchange this week, Japanese politician and member of the House of Councillors of Japan, Hiroyuki Kada, raised the issue of Assassin’s Creed Shadows in an official government meeting, andShigeru Ishiba, the Prime Minister of Japan, responded.
On Steam at least, Assassin's Creed Shadows is going down very well with players. It has a 'very positive' user review rating, with 81% of over 6,000 user reviews marked as positive. IGN’sAssassin’s Creed Shadows reviewreturned an 8/10. We said: “By sharpening the edges of its existing systems, Assassin’s Creed Shadows creates one of the best versions of the open-world style it’s been honing for the last decade.”

"Assassin’s Creed Shadowssaw over 1 million players on launch day, Ubisoft has announced.

The game released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on March 20, and just before 4pm in Canada,Ubisoft took to social mediato say it had crossed the 1 million player mark.
“It's not even 4pm here in Canada and Assassin's Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players!” Ubisoft said.
“Thank YOU from the bottom of our hearts for joining this adventure in Feudal Japan. We are beyond excited to start this journey with you!”
While 1 million players on launch day is an impressive achievement, it’s difficult to gauge success when Ubisoft itself hasn’t offered a sales figure or indeed a sales target.
What we do know is that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the top-selling video game globally on Steam right now. Valve’s chart sorts products by revenue, so we can say Ubisoft’s game is currently bringing in more money than any other on the platform.
We also have early days Steam concurrent figures. According to official stats from Valve’s platform, Assassin’s Creed Shadows hit a peak player concurrent figure of 41,412 on Steam on launch day. Assassin’s Creed Shadows released on a Thursday, so it is expected that that figure will grow as we head into the game’s first weekend on sale. We’ll have a better picture of its performance on Steam next week and in the weeks ahead. Neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.
For some context, BioWare’s single-player RPGDragon Age: The Veilguardlaunched on Steam on Thursday, October 31, 2024, and saw a peak of 70,414 players on Valve’s platform.

"Microsoft has unveiled a list of Xbox Game Pass titles set to join the service in the first half of April 2025, revealing a strong lineup of first- and third-party games, including South of Midnight, Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition, Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls – Ultimate Evil Edition, and more.

South of Midnight, Compulsion Games’ Deep South-set folklore adventure, is poised to be one of Xbox’s biggest releases of the year, and its presence on Game Pass will no doubt have hordes of players seeing what it has to offer. Microsoft’s official description sheds more light on how it will bring some life to Game Pass this month: “Explore the mythos and confront mysterious creatures of the Deep South in this modern folktale while learning to weave an ancient power to surmount obstacles and face the pain haunting your hometown.”

Xbox Game Pass perks are also getting a refresh for the first half of April 2025. Highlights include the Beyond the Void Bundle for The First Descendant, the Sweet Starter Pack for Candy Crush Solitaire players on mobile devices, and an anniversary Seventh Serving Emote for Sea of Thieves fans. You can see the full list of everything coming to Game Pass in the first half of April below.

In retro news, I'm lighting a 30th birthday cake forIndiana Jones' Greatest Adventures, a SNES treasure that belongs in your museum. Developed by Factor 5 and published by JVC/LucasArts, this SNES gem took the tried-and-trueSuper Star Warsformula and applied it toRaiders of the Lost Ark,The Temple of Doom, andThe Last Crusade. With tight controls, detailed sprite work, and a John Williams-fueled chiptune soundtrack, this was a must-have for 16-bit adventurers.
Back in the day, it was pretty amazing stuff to become Indy as he punched, whipped, and jumped his way through jungles, temples, mines, and deserts—all while avoiding Nazis, cultists, and booby traps. The level variety was impressive, with bonus segments including mine cart chases, boulder dashes, and even some Mode7 dogfighting in a biplane.

"PlayStation or Xbox? It’s the long-running question of the modern video game world. At one point or another in your life, you’ve almost certainly been a part of this debate. Maybe you’ve started a Reddit thread, or made a TikTok video, or struck up a heated chat between friends about it. While therearegamers who preach the PC gospel, and Nintendo-as-god fanatics, much of the last two decades of video game history has been made as a result of Sony and Microsoft’s ongoing tete-a-tete. But is this ‘console war’ truly still being waged? The video game industry has gone through immense change in the last year, let alone over the previous two decades. Gamers’ habits, preferences, and options have all increased exponentially in part thanks to the rise of handheld gaming and younger generations’ expertise in building their own gaming machines. The battlefield is now practically unrecognisable compared to its tribal-like origins, but has a victor finally emerged from the trenches? Possibly – but the answer may surprise you.

The video game industry has rapidly evolved to become a financial juggernaut in recent years. In 2019, its worldwide revenue was $285 billion. Last year, it was $475 billion. That figure means that video games made more than the entire world wide movie and music industries in 2023, which made$308 billionand$28.6 billionrespectively. There’s no sign of this growth stopping, either. By 2029, the industry is estimated to generate nearly$700 billion. Not bad considering its humble Pong origins.
All this considered, it’s no surprise that we’ve seen an uptick in Hollywood actors flocking to be a part of a scene with such a lucrative present and future. Mads Mikkelsen, Keanu Reeves, Jon Bernthal and Willem Dafoe to name a few have all starred in games released in the past five years. Their involvement reflects the monumental shift in the perception of video games. Even industry titans like Disney are making significant in-roads into gaming, havingjust invested $1.5 billion into Epic Gamesas part of Bob Iger’s second term challenge to solidify a gaming presence for the company. A rising tide should lift all boats – unless you’re aboard the U.S.S. Microsoft, which seems to have sprung a leak.
The Xbox Series X and S consoles are intended to be an upgrade from the Xbox One in every way. But their advancements have yet to prove truly enticing; the One currently ranks above the Series X/S by almost double the sales. When you couple this fact with comments from analytics company Circana’s games industry expert, Mat Piscatella, who hassuggested that this current console generation is now past its selling peak, it paints a worrying picture for team Xbox. Things appear even worse when you look at console sales figures from 2024. According to Statista, the Xbox Series X/Ssold less than 2.5 million units across the entire year– the PlayStation 5sold the same figure in the first quarter of 2024 alone. There are also the allegations that Xbox is supposedly closing down its department which handles the manufacture and delivery of games to physical retailers, which feels ominously connected to itsevasive responseto areport that it plans to pull out of selling consoles in the EMEA region. If Xbox really has been involved in a ‘console war’, all of this points to the signal to retreat.
But Xbox isn't retreating – it has already surrendered. During the long Activision-Blizzard acquisition process, a statement from Microsoft found in the findings of fact revealed that the company doesn’t believe its Xbox division lost the console war –it thinks it never had a shot to begin with. So, what does a company built around a video game console do when its newest model is struggling to match its predecessor in sales, and its parent company openly remarks on its failure? It gets out of the console business.
It's no secret that Xbox Game Pass has become a key priority for the company.Leaked internal documentsrevealed the estimated prices Xbox expected to be asked to pay to put AAA-titles like Grand Theft Auto 5 ($12-15 million per month) and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor ($300 million) on the subscription service. Xbox taking such costs seriously demonstrates the company consolidating cloud gaming as a key direction for it moving forward. That goal is clear to see in Microsoft’s recent ‘This Is An Xbox’ advertising campaign, which suggests the company is keen to redefine how players think of Xbox – no longer a console, but an always-accessible service with some hardware to complement it instead.
It seems like this rethinking of what an Xbox is means that the brand’s official hardware won’t be limited to being a box under your TV. An Xbox handheld has been rumored to be in development for the past year or so, backed by another leaked document from the Activision-Blizzard dealings which hints at using handheld-friendly hardware for a next-gen'hybrid cloud gaming platform'. But Microsoft’s pivot in strategy has hardly been a secret. From its announcement of plans to createa mobile game storeto compete with Apple and Google, to Xbox chief Phil Spencer’s own admission that mobile gaming’s dominance in the sphere is shaping the company’s own path moving forward, the new M.O. seems simple: Xbox is the video game brand you can play whenever you want, wherever you are.
So why is Microsoft pivoting? Sure, Xbox has struggled over the past couple of generations, but doesn’t the video game console market reign supreme? You’d be surprised. In 2024, of the total 3.3 billion estimated video gamers,over 1.93 billion of them play via a mobile device. That, of course, includes your grandmother playing Candy Crush Saga and your “non-gamer” cousin who still clocks up hours of Clash of Clans. But mobile gaming is now so much more than these casual audiences – over the last decade it has quickly become the dominant pillar of the video game market among every generation, but especially Gen Z and Gen Alpha. In 2024, thetotal market valuation for the video game industrywas $184.3 billion, with mobile games comprising exactly half of that entire figure at $92.5 billion (a 2.8% increase from the previous year). Where do consoles weigh in? At just $50.3 billion, or 27%, and that’s dropped 4% since 2023. No wonder Microsoft wants to turn your phone into an Xbox.
But this isn’t a new development. By 2013, the Asian market for mobile gaming was already dwarfing that of the western world by heights of 759% in South Korea and 280% in China. You might think GTA 5 was the most profitable game of 2013, but you’d be wrong: Both Puzzle & Dragon and Candy Crush Saga outperformed Rockstar’s juggernaut by $1.5 and $1.4 billion respectively. Take a wide-angle lens to the 2010s as a whole for video games, and you’ll find that five of the highest-grossing games were mobile games – Crossfire, Monster Strike, Honor of Kings, Puzzle & Dragon, and Clash of Clans. When you look back on the decade, I highly doubt any of these titles immediately spring to mind – and yet, I’m sure most reading this have the start-up music for Clash of Clans seared into their brains.
Phones are not the only platform drawing attention away from consoles. While not as significant as mobile gaming’s explosion, it’s clear to see that player habits have shifted toward a greater appreciation for PC gaming. Since 2014, there has been a year-on-year growth of 59 million new PC players, taking us from 1.31 billion in 2014 to1.86 billion in 2024. It’s worth noting this rise is complimented by a gargantuan 200 million in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic, during which streaming became a very attractive pastime for many house-bound players. But regardless of if Twitch called to them or not, gamers have become more technologically literate, educated by their peers online on how to build a PC powerhouse, what the best GPUs are, and how to overclock your circuit-ware. As a result, the PC’s global share of the video game market in 2024 lands at $41.5 billion – so it won’t be long until the PC battleline overtakes the army of console players, right? Well, maybe not.Netzoo’s 2016 Global Games Market Value reportdefined a $2.3 billion gap between console and PC – but in 2024, that gap has increased to $9 billion. So despite the rise of more advanced GPUs, circuit-boards, and Gen Z and Alpha’s technological craftiness, it’s a market that’s on thefallrather than the rise – at least for now. If that fall continues, it's not great news for Xbox, which has made Windows PCs its second home.
But it’s not just the dominance of mobile and the uncertain future of PC that Xbox has to contend with. Wars typically have two opposing sides, so it’s about time we looked at where PlayStation fits into this console war. Luckily for Sony, things are going pretty well. In its latest quarterly earnings report, Sony revealed75 million PS5s have been sold to date– that’s a big lead ahead of the combined 29.7 million sales for the Xbox Series X/S. The gap between the two consoles is widening, too; stats suggest that for every one Xbox Series X/S bought during November 2024,five PlayStation 5 consoles were also purchased(a ratio no doubt helped by the launch of the PS5 Pro.) Sony’s Game and Network Services also saw a healthy 12.3% bump in its profits during the final months of 2024, helped specifically by healthy first-party sales including Astro Bot selling 1.5 million copies in under two months, and lifetime sales for Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut surpassing 13 million. The future looks very bright for the PS5. Ampere Analysis’ games research director, Piers Harding-Rolls,estimates that by 2029, Sony will have sold 106.9 million consoles. How do things look for the Xbox Series X/S’s future? Well, leaked Microsoft documents estimate that by 2027,it expects to have sold around 56-59 million units. While it’s not a directly comparable projection, it’s not good. In order for Microsoft to re-establish its competitive edge in the current market, it will need to close the 5:1 PlayStation-to-Xbox gap, significantly increase the number of units sold year-on-year, and also bolster the profitability of its exclusives. Projections don’t support a positive outcome for those first two requirements, and given Phil Spencer’s ‘no red lines’ mantra on Xbox titles coming to PlayStation and Switch (possibly even including the next Halo title), the argument could be made that PlayStation is already the King of Console.
But looking at the PS5 in isolation paints a different picture. 50% of all PlayStation users arecurrently still playing on older PS4sinstead of PS5s, despite the newest generation now entering the second half of its life-cycle. Why is this? Well, of the top 20 best-selling games in the U.S. in 2024, only one is truly PS5-exclusive – Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, at #19. Helldivers 2 does feature at #3 but was also playable on PC at launch. Looking beyond last year, if we disregard remasters of PS4 games, there are roughly 15 genuine PS5-exclusive games on the console as a whole. There’s little here to justify the console’s price in many people’s eyes.
If the PS5 is struggling to justify its regular $500 price tag, then it's understandable why the $700 PS5 Pro debuted to a mixed reception to say the least. The general consensus amongst tech journalists is that perhaps this upgrade came tooearlywithin the cycle, especially given the games advertised in its campaign were slightly upscaled generation-old remasters. WhenIGN polled its readers, the result was overwhelmingly clear – the PS5 Pro has little to offer for forking over that much cash. So, simply put, the PS5 simply isn’t a must-buy console – at least, not yet. This will undoubtedly change when the behemoth that is Grand Theft Auto 6 finally releases later this year, which is almost guaranteed to become the shining star of this generation and the first chance for the PS5 to show off its true power.
So, is the console war over? If you’re Microsoft, it would appear there was never any belief that there was a chance to battle Sony for supremacy. If you’re Sony, your new console has become a success but lacks the true pedigree to be claimed as a new leap forward yet, feeling more like a bunny hop than anything else. The true winner of the console war seems to be those who chose not to play it at all. Rumors of mobile gaming companies encroaching onto the traditional console gaming sphere will only ramp up in the years to come, with Tencent rumored to be in talks to buy out Ubisoft from the Guillemot brothers, having already purchased Sumo Group in 2021. Mobile gaming is becoming increasingly pivotal to the sustainability and profitability of these companies – Take-Two Interactive claim that 10% of the world’s population plays its subsidiary Zynga’s games every month. That means that it’s more than likely that your grandma playing Zynga Poker and Words with Friends 2 is funding the continued development of Grand Theft Auto 6 – not a sentence you would expect to read five years ago, but one reflective of the new state of play of the video game market. The next five years of video gaming history will be defined less and less by who has the most powerful hardware, and more about whose cloud gaming server farm can expand the quickest and strongest. The console war is over, but the mobile gaming war (and the myriad of smaller conflicts that inevitably spin out of it) has only begun.

"Haworth is one of the major players in the world of luxury seating. It has recently partnered with Xbox and its Halo franchise to deliver compellinghigh-end options to gamers. I've spent a good amount of time with its Haworth Fern, trimmed in a unique gradient color, to see if it's worth your investment. Spoiler alert, it's fantastic.

Ergonomic chairs have a tendency to blend together, but the Haworth Fern is at no risk of being confused with anything else. It has a unique wave-like design and open lumbar channel revealing its fronds, lending it a very unique and stylish appearance. You can pick it up in mesh, leather, or knit fabric, with prices ranging from $1,100 to just under $1,900.
It’s a luxury chair through and through, but through a partnership with Microsoft, it has locked gamers squarely in its sights. It offers both Xbox and Halo themed versions of its flagship Fern chair, as well as an Xbox version of its Very gaming chair. These themed versions lock down your choices, but I've yet to see one that doesn't look good. None are overstated, but are also clear matches for their source material. You don't need to worry about losing features if you opt for one of these, however. They are the same in features and comfort as the personalized versions you can craft yourself.
If you decide to configure your own, there's a huge array of customization options. There are four fabrics to choose from: mesh, digital knit, gradient knit, and leather. You can pick from six different colors of mesh and eight for the digital knit, a soft fabric that textures the backrest with tasteful chevrons. Digital Knit takes the same fabric but exchanges the chevron pattern for a gradient that extends from the top of the backrest to the waterfall edge of the seat, and there are five to choose from. Finally, there’s leather, which is available in black, gray, tan, and “luggage” which comes in a camel-like desert brown.
There's quite an array of additional configuration options too. You can outfit the chair with a headrest and an additional lumbar support, choose between 4D armrests or limit them to height only, add forward tilt to accompany the default backward tilt, and decide whether you want a plastic or aluminum base, as well as the finish you would like. All told, it’s one of the most configurable chairs I’ve reviewed. There’s a handful of quick-ship options but most are stated to ship in around five business days. Tan and luggage leather options are made to order and take about three weeks.
No matter which material you choose, every Fern comes with a fabric, cushioned seat and offers the same basic array of ergonomic adjustments. Whether you’re choosing an entry-level version or are opting for a top-of-the-line executive chair, it’s designed to be comfortable and supportive for long hours at a desk, and is made to look every bit the luxury that it is.
It all starts with the backrest. The Fern uses what Haworth calls the Wave Suspension System. This encapsulates the entire backrest, which is actually multiple parts that come together into a cohesive whole. The core of the system sits between the plastic rear frame and the front face. Behind the fabric, supporting your back, is a flexible “cradle.” This is a skeletonized grid sculpted to match the contours of your spine and provide structural support. It mates with the “fern” from which the chair takes its name. This piece quite literally looks like a fern with a “stem” in the center that’s surrounded by flexible “fronds.” The stem is a central channel for the optional adjustable lumbar support. The fronds are support leaves that work with the cradle to maintain targeted support as you sit and move throughout the day.
The Fern is considered a “high-back” chair, so the backrest reaches to the upper back. At 5’8”, it comes up to my shoulders. You can pick up an optional headset that mounts to the top and can move up and down but isn’t angle- or depth-adjustable. It truly does look like a wave and the contours guide you toward the center, aligning with the chair’s lumbar support.
Around the back, the “stem” area is open, giving you a peek at the chair’s internals. If you pick up the added lumbar, its polished aluminum handle lives here, so it’s a functional feature as much as it is an aesthetic one. I recommend getting it if your budget can stretch that far. The chair’s natural contouring is good but the lumbar provides firm, targeted support and is one of the biggest ways you can guarantee that it provides exactly what your unique anatomy requires.
The seat is well padded with formed foam. Its contours guide you toward its center, aligning with the chair’s lumbar support. It's not exceptionally thick but is padded enough to hide the frame and remain comfortable without fear of it becoming too soft over time. On the right side, you'll find a lever to adjust its height, as well as a crank to raise or lower the recline tension. Another paddle controls the tilt lock, allowing you to adjust the recline from being locked upright to a deep recline. It's not a full lay like you'll find with a gaming chair. However, it's perfect for kicking back with a controller.
The armrests come in clutch here. They offer a wide degree of adjustability, much more than your average gaming chair despite sharing the same four axis of adjustment. When it comes to width, they can be tucked right in to support your elbows when holding a controller in your lap or set wide and out of the way. The cushions are soft but resilient. You can lean into them all day long without making yourself sore. I also like that they attach to the frame in thick aluminum channels, so if you do choose to lay your weight into them, you don't need to worry about damaging the plastic.
The headrest is also adjustable, but it's quite simple. It's fairly thin and just moves up and down. It's best positioned between the neck and head and does a good job of offering support there, but it lags behind some competing high-end task chairs, like the Steelcase Gesture, that allow you to angle and depth in addition to height. It gets the job done, but it's far from a make or break feature.
The Haworth Fern is an excellent chair that justifies its high asking price. I’ve been testing it for some time and have put it through its paces over long work days and gaming sessions. In both cases, it has performed exceptionally well and my back has been pain-free throughout. I was sent a gradient knit version, and it’s gorgeous: easily one of the most visually interesting chairs of its type. There was a bit of a wait time as it was made to order, but it is now available with standard shipping. The craftsmanship, quality, and final aesthetic were much worth the wait. The Fern lives up to the hype.
As a rule, chairs like this are fairly simple. They don't take long to wrap your head around, and the controls, while very important to understand and adjust properly, are straightforward once you understand what they do. I still recommend taking the time to read up each and try out slightly different positions and tensions until it feels just right for your body.I was a bit of a Goldilocks with this review, especially when it came to recline tension, but now that it’s set, I really only need to adjust the height and armrests and am glad I took the time for that initial setup.
The controls for the chair are well laid out and easy to use. I like that the seat depth slider is on the opposite side from the other controls and is set back a bit so you have to be intentional about making that specific adjustment. I was less likely to unlock the seat by accident, which is always a pain since the adjustment is so core to your comfort in the chair. I also liked that I didn’t have to get up to make depth adjustments. During initial setup, it definitely made it easy to find the right position and sped up the process.
The materials and build quality are also excellent. The Fern competes with the heaviest hitters in this industry and stands tall: it lacks nothing next to the Herman-Miller Embody, for example, or the Steelcase Leap V2. I would rank it right alongside those flagship offerings without a moment's hesitation. Haworth also offers an excellent 12-year warranty on its chairs. So should anything go wrong or become damaged from normal use, you have an assurance that your investment is protected.
Over the course of this review, I sat in the chair for as long as 7 hours with minor standing breaks in between — without any time lost to assembly as it comes pre-assembled. I have used it reclined with a controller and sitting upright with a mouse and keyboard. I have typed tens of thousands of words, edited photos and videos, prepared spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations, and have generally lived a good chunk of my work life in the chair. And I have done all of that, gotten up, and moved on with my day without feeling any discomfort. It's a case where the chair is a fantastic match for my body.
Just as importantly, it has left me feeling very satisfied with it as my daily driver. I walk into my office and enjoy seeing it at my desk. I appreciate the small details and the high quality craftsmanship throughout its design. And that gradient is just a chef’s kiss when it comes to unique and modern styling, balancing aesthetic with professionalism in a way that’s as at home in a professional office as it is in a gaming den.
The only criticism I really have of it, apart from its high price, is its headrest. It really does feel like an afterthought. And because of the way in which it is attached, through a slit in the fabric of the backrest, it’s not something you can remove and replace. I'm happy it's there, but I wish it offered more adjustability and support.
Taken as a whole, it is fantastic, but there's no way around its high price. With that in mind, it's worth considering a chair like this as an investment in the quality of your work and gaming life. Even though it costs a tidy sum, broken up over the 12 years of its warranty, the yearly cost seems much more reasonable. While it certainly isn't for everyone, it's hard to argue that it's anything less than exceptional.
The Haworth Fern is availabledirectly from Haworthbeginning at $1,100 and extending to around $1,900. It’s available in mesh, Digital Knit, Gradient Knit, and Leather and in a wide range of colors and patterns. It is alsoavailable on Amazonfor a similar price; however, use caution if purchasing from third-party to ensure warranty coverage.
The Haworth Fern is exceptional in just about every way. It's comfortable, supportive, extremely well made and designed to last for years to come. It doesn't come cheap, just like other chairs of its caliber, but if you are looking for a chair that will return its investment in the quality of your daily desk life and pain-free time away, it's well worth considering."
"Amazon is really jacking up the gaming deals in theirSpring Deal Days sale, giving you the limited-time chance to buy a new wirelessXbox controller from just £35.99. While some of the other selections are £4.50 more, the whole selection of colours available for these Series X|S controllers has had a price reduction, so you're getting at least 33% off whichever one you like most.

As a second or spare controller for your Xbox Series X or S console, along with supported games on PC, all those on sale at Amazon right now include the following colours:
Although the standard Carbon Black and Robot White—those bundled with the Xbox Series X & S consoles respectively—have been reduced to the lowest price of £35.99, all of the alternative colors have been dropped to a slightly higher yet still impressive £40.49. If you're in need of a new controller to play the newest games, likeCall of Duty: Black Ops 6which is on sale now as well, this is a fantastic opportunity.
You have to flaunt Amazon a little bit more of your cash to add a splash of style to your setup with one of these vivid color schemes likeAstral Purple, but it does seem worth it. What's more, these other models include the controller's updated design, featuring the X, A, B, and Y buttons being switched from their respective blue, green, red, and yellow colours to match that of their controllers' body.
The original button colours are still shown as tiny dots next to each one, but this update overall gives the controllers a more modest, sleeker appeal that arguably justifies the slightly larger price investment.
For those after a controller with a design that boasts more than one solid colour, Amazon UK also has the Special Fire Vapor Edition of the Xbox Series X|S controller as well,reduced by 20% to £51.99. Featuring titular vapor-like red-and-orange swirls, this bold colour scheme will invoke a little extra energy into your console setup if that's what you're looking for.

"Here's an inexpensive alternative to swapping out AA batteries from your Xbox controller all the time. Amazon is offering atwo-pack of aftermarket rechargeable batteries for your Xbox controllerfor a mere $11.69 after you clip both coupons (20% off and 50% off) on the product page. That's just $5.85 per battery pack. As a comparison, the official MicorosoftPlay & Charge Kitwill run you $25, and that is for a single battery pack.

These rechargeable battery packs from ""6amLifestyle"" are compatible with both thecurrent generation Xbox Series X|S controllersand theolder Xbox One controllers. A nice feature of these battery packs is that they work with the stock USB port on the Xbox controller. Most other rechargeable packs have their own little port elsewhere that you need to use. A quality 10ft USB Type-C cable is included as well as a USB Type-C to Micro USB adapter for the legacy Xbox One controller. The cable is pretty cool because it has a little light that glows red when charging and blue when fully topped off.
6amLifestyle states that each battery pack can last up to 35 hours of continuous playtime and can charge from empty to full in about three hours. That's pretty similar to the Play & Charge Kit's claim of 30 hours of playtime and four-hour charge time, which makes sense since both packs have the same 1,400mAh capacity. Having two batteries also means you can immediately swap over to another pack when the first one is depleted, thus minimizing your downtime.

"It’s the final day ofAmazon’s Big Spring Sale. Luckily, we’re still seeing plenty of massive deals dropping, and if you’ve got the Xbox Series X or S you won’t want to miss this one. Both the 2TB and 1TBWD_Black C50drives are on sale.  The 2TB option has $60 knocked off the list price, while you can score the 1TB drive for 30% off. Those are the lowest prices we’ve seen in 2025!

Given the Series X comes with only 1TB of storage (and it’s not all usable) and the Series S slashes that space almost in half, an expansion card is one of thebest Xbox accessoriesyou can grab, especially if you’ve got a healthy library of games. However, not all expansion cards are created equal, as only some let you run Xbox games directly from the SSD. The WD_Black C50 is one of the few that do, which is why it’s one ofIGN’s top SSDs for Xbox Series X|S.
The WD_Black C50 is a simple plug-and-play solution, easily slotting into the console’s expansion slot. It’s basically NVME SSD storage specialized for Xbox, but far simpler to set up than many of thebest PS5 SSDs. In a matter of minutes, the drive will be ready to install and play games. Compared to the Xbox’s internal storage, games should feel exactly the same, thanks to the expansion card’s Xbox Velocity Architecture. Transfer speeds will be just as snappy while boot times will only be marginally slower.
If you’ve got a massive collection of games that you want ready to play at a moment's notice or even just a couple of games that take up the lion's share of the storage, Western Digital’s discounted 2TB drive is the way to go. For smaller needs, you can’t go wrong with the 1TB option. Still, no matter which size you grab, the compact, durable design makes the external SSD an ultra-portable storage solution for the Xbox Series X|S. Plus, it’s one of the few options officially licensed by Xbox."
"If you're in the market for a new PlayStation or Xbox console and bottom-line pricing is your utmost priority, check out these deals from AliExpress. You can get a brand new importedXbox Series XandPlayStation 5consoles for much lower than you can find a new model elsewhere. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming consoles that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by your account, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item. These consoles all ship locally from the United States and usually arrive within one week.

AliExpress as a whole is a legitimate website, but since it is a marketplace comprised of individual sellers, you have to make sure that the vendor you're buying from is reputable. In many cases, the easiest way to do so is to look at the seller's rating and history. In terms of the products we've listed in this article, while it's true that some of the sellers may not have many reviews,AliExpress has reached out to us and personally vetted these vendors, which is why we feel comfortable promoting them. AliExpress also offers a 15 to 90 day free return policy depending on the product.
AliExpress has dropped the price of the professional-grade Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Controller to only $74.42 shipped after you apply coupon code ""IFP3TXY""in cart. That's a huge price drop from its normal $140 list price and nearly the same cost as a standard Xbox controller. Note that this is a Hong Kong or Japanese import model in new retail packaging, but you won't find it cheaper anywhere else. Aside from the different color scheme, the Core controller is identical to the Xbox Elite Series 2 non-Core controller. The Core controller, however, does not include the component pack. AliExpress offers a 90-day return policy.
AliExpress also just dropped the price on a new retail boxed (imported) Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 wireless gaming controller – component pack included – to $100 shipped. This controller retails for $180 and the lowest price we've ever seen for this controller stateside is about $130-$140.
Lenovo has dropped the price of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller to slightly lower than what we saw on Black Friday. Right now you can chooseSterling Silver,Volcanic Red, orCobalt Bluefor only $54 plus free shipping after you apply coupon code ""PLAY5"" in cart. Lenovo might not be the first site you'd think of for great deals on PlayStation controllers, but surprisingly, no one can match their pricing. This might be your last chance to get a DualSense controller at this price for quite a while, at least untilSony's PlayStation Days of Play Salethat will probably happen sometime in late May.
SteelSeries is currently offering theArctis Nova 7 Dragon Editiongaming headset for only $119.99 after an $80 off instant discount. The Dragon Edition is identical to the Nova Arctis 7 in build quality and performance, but with the addition of a deep red colorway with decorative gold dragon accents in celebration of 2024's Year of the Dragon motif. Even though 2024 has passed, this is still one of SteelSeries' classier designs that doesn't feel outdated or out of place.
SteelSeries is also taking 35% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets. The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Destiny 2 in-game items.

The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core wireless controller is physically the same controller as the older generation Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, which retails for a much higher $180. That means that the Core controller retains all the integrated pro gaming features like adjustable-tension thumbsticks, wrap-around rubberized grip, and shorter hair trigger locks. It's a much superior option to the standard Xbox Core controller that the current gen consoles come with.
Aside from the color scheme, theonlydifference is that the original Elite controller comes with more accessories: extra sets of paddles, thumbsticks, D-pad, and a travel case. The Elite Series 2 Core doesn't come with any of those accessories. You can buy them separately as acomponent packfor $59.99, however if you do want the component pack, you'll save money by getting the non-Core edition right off the bat (see below).

"Thank your own personal deity—possibly Kratos—it’s Friday! Even though it’s Autumn for Aussies, it’s time to spring into ludicrous Spring Salesavings on Steam. If the picks of that litter don’t interest you, I’ve sniffed out console-based bargains on grand adventures, pulse-pounding action, or quirky indie gems; there’s a little something for everyone.

In retro news, I'm (somehow) celebrating the 23rd birthday of the OG Xbox, a console that blew my mind at launch (even though I was happily married to a PS2). This was the chunky vehicle that brought Microsoft into the console gaming world. And while it didn't have the prettiest design or the greatest library of games, it gave us two important contributions to gaming:Haloand Xbox Live.
While some N64 enthusiasts may argue thatGoldenEyepaved the way for quality console first-person shooters, it wasHalothat revolutionised the genre. Almost every FPS that came after Halo utilised its control scheme and a modified version of its health system. But where Halo truly succeeded was in providing console gamers with the first-of-its-kind 16-player LAN battles. This was the first shooter that made my PC gaming mates jealous, and I still own and adore myLimited Edition Crystal Xbox.

"The modder who releaseda playable recreation of the Grand Theft Auto 6 map in Grand Theft Auto 5has ceased all work on the project after being hit by a takedown from Rockstar owner Take–Two.

‘Dark Space’ had created a free-to-download playable GTA 5 map based on leaked coordinate data and official trailer shots of GTA 6, and uploaded gameplay footage to his YouTube channel. His videos and his mod hit the headlines in January as information-starved GTA fans flocked to experience a fan-made approximation of what they can expect to play officially when GTA 6 launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S this fall.
Then, last week, Dark Space received the dreaded strike notification from YouTube after Take-Two issued a copyright removal request. If a YouTube channel receives multiple copyright strikes, it runs the risk of being terminated.
In response, Dark Space removed all download links to his mod, despite the fact he has yet to be asked to do so by Take-Two, and publisheda response videoon his channel calling out the company for its actions and suggesting it was the result of the mod's take on GTA 6's map being ""probably a little too accurate.""
Dark Space was more philosophical in a follow-up interview with IGN. “I expected this would happen based on their past takedowns,” the modder said. “I went into this project knowing it was a possibility, and the fact that it happened does not surprise me.”
Dark Space said he believes Take-Two went after his mod because it was based on an online GTA 6 community mapping project that uses leaked coordinate points to “perfectly” map out the upcoming virtual space, and as a result might have ruined the surprise for players and the internet at large.
“That's probably the biggest red flag, although most of the work in my map was based on the trailer shots,” Dark Space added.
“I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get. If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too.”
The upshot is Dark Space’s GTA 6 mod project is no more. And that’s not just for YouTube videos of it, that’s for the entire thing. “Well they clearly do not want this project to exist,” Dark Space said. “So it's not just under threat, it's eliminated. There’s no point putting more time into something that goes directly against what they’re willing to allow.
“I'm just going to keep making videos that people hopefully like. I probably won't do anything else modding GTA 5 in relation to GTA 6, since it seems dangerous.”
There are now concerns that the GTA 6 community mapping project could be next in Take-Two’s sights. IGN has contacted the group for comment.
Take-Two has a history of taking down fan projects, most recentlythe YouTube channel belonging to the makers of the ‘GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition,’which ports the world, cutscenes, and missions from 2002’s Vice City into 2008’s GTA 4.
One former Rockstar developer has defended the company’s actions here, saying both Take-Two and Rockstar are protecting their business interests.
“Take2/R* are a commercial company,” former Rockstar Games technical director Obbe Vermeijtweeted. “They will take down mods that interfere with their business interests.
“The VC NextGen Edition mod for GTA4 directly competes with the Definitive Edition. The Liberty City preservation project (GTA4 in GTA5 engine) would interfere with a possible GTA4 remaster. (No idea whether they’re working on that. I think they should.)
“There’s no point getting angry about it. This is what companies are supposed to do. The best we can hope for is that they allow mods that don’t interfere with their business. Such as DCA3 (GTA3 for Dreamcast). Afaik they have recently been decent about letting these projects continue.”
While you wait for GTA 6 to come out, check out IGN’s coverage of an ex-Rockstar dev who saysthe studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025, Take-Two boss StraussZelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out, and the expert opinion onwhether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second.

"In 2012, Assassin’s Creed 3 director Alex Hutchinson called out people on the internet for suggesting the most “boring” future settings for the series. “The three most wanted [settings for Assassin’s Creed] are WWII, feudal Japan and Egypt,” he explained at the time, adding “They’re kind of the three worst settings for an AC game.” Hutchinson later clarified his statement, saying “the point I was trying to make was that in the broad strokes and scale of history, that’s a theme that’s been well-mined in video games.” He’s not wrong and since he made his most recent comments, Ghost of Tsushima, Rise of the Ronin, Nioh and more have all shone a spotlight on feudal Japan.

Fast-forward to 2025 and Assassin’s Creed is finally going to one of these “worst” settings with Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, but Shadows director Jonathan Dumont believes his team has found a new way to tell the story of feudal Japan.
""I think it's not boring at all. The setting is very exciting,"" Dumont says when asked about Hutchinson’s quote. ""I do think that being able to bring it to life and have that balance of the political intrigue [of the era], the war and conflict, and also the beauty of nature and supporting more exploration within this changing world give it another dimension [compared to other games].""
Hutchinson wasn’t wrong back in 2012. The setting of Feudal Japan has indeed been one of the most requested locations for the Assassin's Creed series. Bringing the series' unique blend of historical fiction and sci-fi to the backdrop of warring states and samurai in fierce conflict seemed like a no-brainer for developer Ubisoft to make happen sooner rather than later. The only problem was Ubisoft chose later, perhaps to its detriment.
Though Ubisoft has been praised for exploring previously overlooked historical settings like Egypt and Industrial Revolution England, other developers have beaten Ubisoft to open-world stealth-action games set in Japan with titles like Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Tsushima. That said, shows like FX’s Shogun prove that people’s appetites for samurai action hasn’t waned in the least. Much like Shogun, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows explores how outsiders navigate the courts and politics of feudal Japan. And the Assassin’s Creed name has a built-in reputation all on its own.
Dumont highlights the conflict and historical impact of the era – particularly in how Japan was ""opened up"" to the rest of the world for the first time following the arrival of Portuguese merchants and missionaries during the late 1500s Sengoku era.
""What made the setting interesting for us to tackle was the political landscape of the time, along with the arts and the environment of that era. We've seen other games do it before, but not in the Assassin's Creed way that we're doing it,"" says Dumont. ""We also have that big open-world feeling with the big cities, the wilderness, and we really touch upon the historical arts and the reconstruction of these locations to make it real for that time. So I don't think we've seen that necessarily in a lot of games [covering this era] – to truly explore and bring you into that world.”
According to Dumont, the political intrigue of the era made it a particularly compelling setting to tackle for Assassin's Creed. A key difference he highlights that makes Shadows different from other games is how it brings a more dynamic and deeper dive into a politically troubled era filled with conflict – one that players will be able to immerse themselves in and learn more about almost from the moment the game begins.
There is also the matter of new technology that Ubisoft utilized in order to bring its version of Japan to life.
""The team was very enthusiastic about Assassin's Creed's take on Feudal Japan, and we felt that the latest technological improvements and new consoles would help us bring that vision to life,"" says Dumont. He highlights the dynamic weather and seamless open-world, and according to our review, the team seemingly succeeded in creating one of the best historical locations in Assassin’s Creed history.
Remember, the Assassin’s Creed series began during the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 era, and since then technology has come a long way, with 4K resolution, bigger open worlds with greater density, and ray-tracing now standard on consoles and PC.
""What that does is give a much more 'alive' feeling than what we've done in the past [with other games],"" he continues. ""So I think that technology that took a few years to develop is omnipresent and all around you within the game. It does bring another dimension of being able to see the world in different states – which gives it more depth. It would not have been possible to make Shadows without our current technology; I don't think we would have gotten that feeling of losing ourselves in this open world without it.""
What makes the Assassin's Creed series so compelling is how it takes historical settings and injects its patented stealth-action gameplay and open-world immersion to make them all the more engrossing. Assassin's Creed Shadows leans into the samurai and ninja fantasy, much like other games tackling this setting. And the need to one-up the competition presented a big challenge to ensure the game's scope was well realized – and given the lengthy wait for the series to tackle a Japan setting, Dumont felt the wait was worth it.
“It's really all about keeping the vision there, and the team keeps pushing for better quality in every aspect,” he says. “There's always a challenge with trying to meet people's expectations, and we also put the pressure on ourselves to do the best we can.""

"Indiana Jones and the Great Circlehas a PlayStation 5 rating onthe website of the Entertainment Software Rating Board, suggesting a release date isn’t too far away.

MachineGames’ well-received action adventure game launched on Xbox Series X and S and PC in December 2024, and currently has a spring 2025 release window on PS5. That suggests the game will be out at some point in the next few months.
Microsoft has so far remained quiet on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s PS5 release date, preferring to focus on other games at its recent Xbox Developer Direct showcase. But it seems an announcement will be made soon.
MachineGames has issued a series of updates since the game’s initial Xbox launch,most recently fixing various bugs and adding support for Nvidia DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Ray Reconstruction on PC. The PS5 version will of course feature all the console updates released to date.
Boosted by launching day one on Game Pass, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has so farreached 4 million players— a figure that will no doubt see a significant boost one the PS5 version goes live.
Indiana Jones actor Harrison Ford has saidTroy Baker playing the beloved character in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is proof ""you don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul.""
Ford discussed alleviating control of Indy withThe Wall Street Journal, saying he was very happy with the performance of The Last of Us actor Baker.
""You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul,"" Ford said. ""You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent. He did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.""

"The last thing I expected Doom: The Dark Ages to remind me of was Halo 3. And yet, half way through a recent hands-on demo with id Software’s gothic prequel, I was mounted on the back of a cyborg dragon and unleashing a salvo of machinegun fire across the side of a demonic battle barge. With the vessel’s defensive turrets destroyed, I landed my beast atop the ship and proceeded to charge through its lower decks, turning the entire crew into a few gallons of red slop. Seconds later, the warmachine was toast and I burst through its hull, leaping onto my dragon to continue my crusade against the machines of Hell.

Those familiar with Bungie’s landmark Xbox 360 shooter will instantly recognise the shape of Master Chief’s assault on the Covenant’s scarab tanks. The helicopter-like Hornet may have been swapped for a holographic-winged dragon and the giant laser-firing mech for an occult flying boat, but the core of the experience is all here: an aerial assault that transitions into a devastating boarding action. Surprisingly, this wasn’t the only moment in the demo that reminded me of Halo. While the combat core of The Dark Ages is unmistakably and singularly Doom, the campaign’s design seems to have a very “late-2000s shooter” spin thanks to its love of elaborate cutscenes and a greater push for gameplay novelty.
Across two and a half hours I played four levels of Doom: The Dark Ages. Only the first of them, the campaign’s opener, resembled the tightly paced, immaculately mapped design of Doom (2016) and its sequel. The others saw me piloting a colossal mech, flying the aforementioned dragon, and exploring a wide-open battlefield dotted with secrets and powerful minibosses. It’s a big departure from Doom’s usual pursuit of mechanical purity, instead feeling akin to the likes of Halo, Call of Duty, and – weirdly – old James Bond games like Nightfire, all of which thrive on scripted setpieces and novelty mechanics that guest star for a mission or two.
This is a fascinating direction for Doom to head in, because once upon a time the series made something of a U-turn away from this. The cancelled Doom 4 was set to resemble Call of Duty, not only due to its modern military aesthetic but also thanks to an increased emphasis on characters, cinematic storytelling, and scripted events. After years of work id Software concluded that such ideas simply weren’t a good fit for the series, scrapping them in favour of the much more focused Doom (2016). And yet, in 2025, here they are in The Dark Ages.
My demo opened on a long and elaborate cutscene, (re)introducing the realm of Argent D'Nur, the opulent Maykrs, and the Night Sentinels – the knightly brothers-in-arms of the Doom Slayer. The big guy himself is depicted as a terrifying legend; a nuclear-level threat on two legs. While all of this lore will be familiar to Doom obsessives who poured over the prior games’ codex entries, the deeply cinematic approach with which it’s now presented feels very new. Very different. Very Halo. That continues into the levels themselves, with NPC Night Sentinels scattered about the environment akin to UNSC Marines. While they don’t fight alongside you (at least not in the levels I demoed) there’s certainly a greater sense that you’re part of an army – like Master Chief, you’re the invincible spearhead of a large force.
There’s a lot of character work in the introductory cutscene and it remains to be seen if this is something Doom really needs. I’m a big fan of the prior games’ slight approach to story, and part of me would rather The Dark Ages continued to tell the Slayer’s tale through environment design and codex entries, reserving cinematics only for the big reveals à la Eternal. But while I have my reservations, the cutscenes thankfully know their place: they tee up a mission and are never seen again, refusing to interrupt Doom’s signature intense flow.
There are interruptions in other forms, though. After that opening mission, which starts with pure shotgun slaughter and ends with you parrying Hell Knights using the Slayer’s incredible new shield, I was thrown into the cockpit of a Pacific Rim-like Atlan mech and asked to wrestle demonic kaiju. After that, I was soaring through the skies on that cybernetic dragon, taking down battle barges and picking off gun emplacements. These tightly scripted levels create a significant gear shift, punctuating the campaign’s rapid pace with new gameplay ideas that are reminiscent of Call of Duty’s biggest novelties, such as Modern Warfare’s AC-130 gunship sequence or Infinite Warfare’s dogfighting missions. The Atlan is slow and heavy, and the skyscraper-high perspective makes Hell’s armies look like Warhammer miniatures. The dragon, meanwhile, is fast and agile, and the shift to a wide-angle third-person camera results in a very different experience that feels a dimension away from classic Doom.
Many of the best FPS campaigns thrive on this kind of variety. Half-Life 2 and Titanfall 2 are the gold standard for it. Halo has endured so long partly because its mix of vehicular and on-foot sequences provides it with a rich texture. But I’m unsure if this will work for Doom. As with Eternal, The Dark Ages is once again a wonderfully complex shooter to play – every second demands your complete attention as you weave together shots, shield tosses, parries, and brutal melee combos. In comparison, the mech and dragon sequences feel anemic, stripped back, and practically on-rails – their combat engagements so tightly controlled they almost resemble QTEs.
In Call of Duty the switch to driving a tank or firing from a circling gunship works because the mechanical complexity of such scripted sequences isn’t that far removed from the on-foot missions. But in The Dark Ages there’s a clear gulf between gameplay styles, so much so it’s akin to a middle school guitar student playing alongside Eddie Van Halen. And while I know Doom’s core combat will always be the star, when I’m beating the snot out of a giant demon with a rocket-powered mech punch I shouldn’t be wishing I was back on the ground using a “mere” double-barrelled shotgun.
My final hour of play saw The Dark Ages shift into another unusual guise, but one built on what feels like a much sturdier foundation. “Siege” is a level that returns its focus to id’s best-in-class gunplay, but it opens up Doom’s typically claustrophobic level design into a huge open battlefield, its geography shifting between narrow and wide to provide a myriad of pathways and combat arenas. The goal, to destroy five Gore Portals, has the same energy as Call of Duty’s multi-objective, complete-in-any-order missions, but I was reminded once more of Halo – the grand scale of this map versus the tighter routes of the opening level evokes the contrast between Halo’s interior and exterior environments. And, like Halo, the novelty here is that the excellent core shooter systems are given new context in much larger spaces. You must rethink the effective range of every single weapon in your arsenal. Your charge attack is employed to close football field-length distances. And the shield is used to deflect artillery fired from oversized tank cannons.
The downside of expanding Doom’s playspace is that things can become a little unfocused – I found myself backtracking and looping through empty pathways, which really does kill the pace. It’s here I’d like to have seen The Dark Ages veer even closer to Halo by throwing the dragon into the mix and using it like a Banshee; being able to fly across this battlefield, raining down fire before divebombing into a miniboss battle, would have helped maintain the pace and make the dragon feel more integral to the experience. If such a level exists beyond what I’ve seen, I’ll be very happy.
Regardless of the overall shape of the full campaign, though, I am fascinated that so much of what I’ve seen feels like a resurrection and reinterpretation of ideas that were once considered an ill-fit for the series. Very little of the cancelled Doom 4 was released for the public to see, but aKotaku reportfrom 2013 paints a distinct picture. “There were a lot of scripted set pieces,” a source told the publication, among them allegedly an “obligatory vehicle scene.” And that’s exactly what we’ve got in the Atlan and dragon sections – mechanically simple scripted sequences that hark back to the novelty vehicle levels of Xbox 360-era shooters.
Talking to Noclipin 2016, id Software’s Marty Stratton confirmed that Doom 4 “was much closer to something like [Call of Duty]. A lot more cinematic, a lot more story to it. A lot more characters around you that you are with throughout the course of the gameplay.” All that was scrapped, and so it’s genuinely fascinating to see so much of it return in The Dark Ages. This is a campaign set to feature big boarding action setpieces, lusciously rendered cinematics, a much wider cast of characters, and huge lore reveals.
The question now is: were those ideas always a bad idea for Doom, or were they just a bad idea when they looked too much like Call of Duty? Part of me is just as skeptical as the fans who once decried “Call of Doom”, but I’m also excited at the idea of id Software finally making that approach work by grafting it on to the now-proven modern Doom formula.
The beating, gory heart of The Dark Ages unquestionably remains its on-foot, gun-in-hand combat. Nothing in this demo suggested that it will not be centre stage, and everything I played affirms it's another fantastic reinvention of Doom’s core. I think that alone is strong enough to support an entire campaign, but id Software obviously has other designs. I’m surprised that a couple of the studio’s new ideas feel so mechanically slim, and I am concerned that they will feel more like contaminants than fresh air. But there’s still a lot more to see, and only in time will these fractured demo missions be contextualised. And so I eagerly await May 15th, not just to return to id’s unrivaled gunplay, but to satisfy my curiosity. Is Doom: The Dark Ages a good late-2000s FPS campaign or a messy one?

In an unusual move for a AAA game, no special or deluxe editions have been announced for Silent Hill f. The standard edition is the only choice, which I find kind of refreshing, actually.
While no universal preorder bonuses are available for Silent Hill f, Best Buy has one for its paid members. My Best Buy Plus and Total members will receive a free $10 Best Buy gift card for preordering the game. You cansign up herestarting at $49.99 per year.
Silent Hill f is a new installment in the long-running franchise that’s set in 1960s Japan, making it a good place for newcomers to the series to jump in. However, it’s not for the faint of heart: it containsgruesome scenes of violence and gorethat won’t be appreciated by everyone. If you’re not a horror person, or you’re squeamish when you see platters of entrails, for instance, you may want to steer clear of this one.

In retro news, I'm celebrating the 21st birthday of a series black sheep that still sold many a GameCube,Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. As a remake of the '98 PS classic, this was a pretty surreal (and, in parts, misguided) love letter. It was as if Snake had emerged from a time machine, equipped with the control scheme and acrobatics ofMGS 2: Sons of Liberty. Helmed by Silicon Knights and injected with the ""cinematic flair"" of Hollywood action director Ryuhei Kitamura, the end result divided fans quicker than a cyber-ninja disarming Ocelot.
Upgrades like first-person aiming and being able to hang/drop from ledges were a double-edged sword. While they made Snake more powerful and adaptable, they also turned sections of his Shadow Moses op into a cakewalk. The level design, originally built for the PS1’s limitations, just wasn’t fully rebalanced to accommodate these new mechanics, and some re-recorded voice performances weren't ideal. Be that as it Mei [Ling], I still recall loving this at launch and adore the copy I own.

"Dinosaur survival gameArk 2, which some had suspected might have run into trouble or even been abandoned, is back on after developer Studio Wildcard revealed a new expansion forArk: Survival Ascendedthat leads into the sequel.

Ark: Lost Colony is the first original expansion pack for Ark 1 remake Ark: Survival Ascended, and its reveal trailer, below, was produced by anime studio Mappa (Jujutsu Kaisen, Attack on Titan, Chainsaw Man) and stars voiceover by the Michelle Yeoh, who reprises her role as Mei Yin from Ark: The Animated Series.
Studio Wildcard said the expansion will feature numerous cinema-grade anime story sequences created by Mappa. Here’s the official blurb:
In its note to press, Studio Wildcard said Ark: Lost Colony “directly connects” the storylines of Ark’s Extinction and Genesis expansions and leads into the events of Ark 2.
Ark 2 is the Unreal Engine 5-powered sequel to the hugely successfulArk Survival Evolved. It was first announced with a surprise Vin Diesel cameo at The Game Awards 2020, at the time with a 2022 release date, but it was later delayed into 2023. Then, earlier in 2023,Ark 2 was delayed again, this time to late 2024 as an Xbox Series X and S console exclusive, day-one on Game Pass, and on PC via Steam and Windows.
As recently as December 2023,Studio Wildcard was still insisting Ark 2 was on track for a late 2024 release window. Obviously that didn’t happen, sparking concern from fans. So this announcement, coming three months into 2025, will help reassure fans that Ark 2 is still in the works, although Studio Wildcard failed to provide an updated release window.
We do have firmer details for Ark: Lost Colony, however. Pre-orders kick off in June 2025, and all purchases immediately unlock exclusive Ark: Lost Colony preview gameplay content. A full release is set for November 2025, with Ark: Lost Colony priced at $29.99 for Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, and PC.

"The globe-trotting World of Assassination trilogy of IO Interactive's Hitman series is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 asHitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition. And alongside arriving in the Switch 2 launch window, Agent 47 will also be donning some new, appropriately Nintendo-themed duds.

OnIO Interactive's site, the developer confirmed Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition will go up for pre-order soon, for both digital and physical editions. A pre-order of the digital edition will get you the Signature Pack, which includes two red-and-white outfits for Agent 47, a golden wrench, and a mushroom. Mushroom effects unknown at this time.
Physical pre-orders, meanwhile, offer both the Signature Pack and the Quack Pack, which offers a Luigi-themed green-and-grey suit and a green rubber duck. Much like a bald guy in a red tie and suit at a Paris fashion show, nothing unusual to see here.
Less-than-subtle references aside, it's fun to see Agent 47 get some Nintendo attire. Other games likeBayonettaandThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrimgot their own Nintendo crossover cosmetics, and Agent 47 certainly has earned a bit of Nintendo theming of his own.
The World of Assassination spans a trilogy of games, as Agent 47 undertakes a number of missions to assassinate targets and complete contracts for his clientele. Starting with 2016's Hitman, the WoA trilogy runs up through Hitman III, whichIGN gave a 9, saying: ""Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is one of the barcoded butcher's best appearances.""
Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition combines all of it together into one package. This includes the main campaign, contracts mode, escalations, Elusive Target arcades, and featured live content for Hitman, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3. Also included is the Freelancer game mode, a roguelike option for those who want even more variety and options in their Hitman experience.
Currently, Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition is due to arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in June 2025. Its also available now on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, the original Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation PS VR2.

"Developer Goodwin Games has announced a new survival horror game for PC called Quite a Ride. Built with Unreal Engine 5, you must keep pedaling on your bike in order to keep the fog around you – and the horrors within it – from consuming you. It doesn't have a release date as of yet.

As Goodwin describes it, ""You travel by bicycle through a foggy rural landscape filled with eerie secrets and monsters lurking in the dense mist. The game's atmosphere and themes draw inspiration from Stephen King's works and iconic horror films of the '80s and '90s."" Check out the announcement trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.
Your phone's battery drains over time and must be recharged by continuing to pedal your bike. And that phone will keep sending you strange messages that might help or hurt you. Meanwhile, as you go, you'll encounter oddities like deserted towns and bizarre laboratories. The road is always changing, but Goodwin says there's a unique pseudo-multiplayer twist: ""Players' collective global efforts can change the environment, unlocking new locations, hidden characters and secret quests over time.""
You canwishlistQuite a Ride on Steam if you're interested.

"Bethesda has announced that MachineGames’Indiana Jones and The Great Circlelaunches on PlayStation 5 on April 15 for early access ahead of a global release on April 17. Those whopre-ordergetaccess to the early access.

The PS5 release date, which comes four months after Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launched on Xbox and PC, was announced alongside a playful promo trailer that sees perhaps the two most famous video game actors in the world on-screen together.
In the trailer, Indiana Jones actor Troy Baker sits down for a chat with Uncharted star Nolan North, who famously plays intrepid explorer Nathan Drake in the PlayStation-exclusive series. Drake and the Uncharted series are of course heavily inspired by Indiana Jones, so this meeting of the actors who play the characters is a full circle moment for The Great Circle itself.
There’s an added layer here, which is the Microsoft-owned Bethesda has drafted in Nolan North, the actor behind the Sony-owned franchise Uncharted, for a chinwag in one of its adverts. Now, at no point does North say ‘Nathan Drake’ or ‘Uncharted’ or anything that might legally belong to Sony Computer Entertainment, but his delivery in the video is knowing indeed.
Drake — I mean North — playfully suggests he broke into the lavishly decorated room in which he’s sat and so doesn’t have much time to talk. The suggestion here is goons might burst through the door at any moment, as they tend to do when Nate is rummaging through drawers on the hunt for clues.
North asks Baker how he’s going to deal with Private Military Forces with just a whip. Baker points to his head, saying, “use the old—” “headbutt,” North interjects. “I like it. Aggressive.” North says he’s “more of a sidearms kinda guy… jeans… henley,” and, as Baker quips, “somehow always half-tucked.”
Both North and Baker then bond over a shared enthusiasm for ancient artefacts, although North wants to sell them to the highest bidder, while Baker wants to donate them to a museum. This is Nathan Drake accepting the new Indiana Jones into a “very exclusive club” of adventurers. “Welcome to the club,” North declares. Xbox’s Indiana Jones now sits proudly alongside PlayStation’s Uncharted on Sony’s console, treasure-hunters in crime. All that’s left is for Lara Croft to break through the window and say something about not wanting the boys to have all the fun.
This is all part of Microsoft’s now-established multiplatform push, which has already seen a number of Xbox games launch on rival consoles. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is just the latest to make the jump, with Playground’s Forza Horizon 5, Id Software’s Doom: The Dark Ages and, reportedly, many more Microsoft-made games not far behind.
Boosted by launching day one on Game Pass, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has so farreached 4 million players— a figure that will no doubt see a significant boost once the PS5 version goes live.
Indiana Jones actor Harrison Ford has saidTroy Baker playing the beloved character in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is proof ""you don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul.""
Ford discussed alleviating control of Indy withThe Wall Street Journal, saying he was very happy with the performance of The Last of Us actor Baker.
""You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul,"" Ford said. ""You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent. He did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.""

"If you're looking for an OLED TV from a reputable brand name at a great price, then Best Buy has got a solid deal going on right now. The Sony Bravia XR A75L 4K OLED smart TVs are on sale right now with the 55"" model priced at $999.99 and the 65"" model for $1,299.99. These prices are lower than what we saw during Black Friday (the 65"" model was $1499 at the time). Although the A75L is an older generation (2023) TV, it's still one of the best TVs out there in terms of image quality and gaming performance. Especially for the 55"" model, you won't find a better TV for under $1,000.

Generally speaking, OLED TVs are considered the best TVs you can buy right now. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, they offer better image quality, deeper blacks, better contrast ratio, wider color gamut, and super fast response times. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV are easily the best type of TV for viewing 4K HDR content in all of its glory.
OLED technology aside, the A75L has  the features you'd want in a current generation gaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel as well as two HDMI 2.1 ports that can run games in 4K at up to 120fps on a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming console. The OLED panel benefits from a near instantaneous response time (sub 0,.03ms) and supports features like variable refresh rate (VRR) including G-SYNC and auto low latency mode (ALLM). Note that despite this being a Sony TV, it pairs equally well with an Xbox console.
Sony OLED TVs use Google TV as its smart interface. Google TV is intuitive to use and supports voice commands through Google Assistant. You can also pair it with an Android phone to use as a remote.
You don't have to wait for the new 2025 LG TVs to drop to score a great deal on an older generation model. Right now, you can pick up a 202365"" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TVfor just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday. The LG Evo C-series of TVs have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVs, especially for 4K HDR movies and gaming.

"A Minecraft Moviehas enjoyed a record-breaking start at the box office, leapfroggingThe Super Mario Bros. Movieto secure the biggest domestic debut in history for a video game adaptation.

The Xbox game adaptation starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, the latter of whom also starred in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, smashed box office expectations with an enormous $157 million at North American theaters. The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which for now remains the highest-grossing video game adaptation of all time,enjoyed $146 million domestically during its opening weekend in April 2023.
A Minecraft Movie added $144 million via the international box office for a global opening weekend total of $301 million. A Minecraft Movie reportedly cost $150 million to produce before global marketing costs, so it may already be profitable for Warner Bros.
A Minecraft Movie is of course based on Mojang'sMinecraft, the best-selling video game of all time. The Microsoft-owned sandbox remains one of the most popular video games in the world, and has movie tie-in DLC to capitalize on the film’s launch.
IGN’sA Minecraft Movie reviewreturned a 6/10. We said: “Napoleon Dynamite director Jared Hess puts a surprisingly specific and funny comic spin on A Minecraft Movie’s kid-friendly adventure, especially in its less antic first half.”
If you’ve seen the film, be sure to check out IGN’sA Minecraft Movie Ending and Post-Credits Scene ExplainedWith Director Jared Hess and Minecraft's Torfi Frans Ólafsson.
Meanwhile, Disney’s live-action Snow White looks set for disaster statusafter a disappointing opening weekend box office. It’s now up to $168.4 million globally ($77.5 million domestic and $90.9 million international), and with a reported $250 million production budget, aMufasa: The Lion King-style sleeper hit comeback may be beyond it.

"Monster Hunter WildsTitle Update 1 goes live tonight or tomorrow, depending on where you are in the world, and ahead of its release date, Capcom has published the patch notes so players can get a peek at what's in store.

Over on theMonster Hunter site, the patch notes lay out everything for Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1. Some of this is info that's already been unveiled in previous streams, like theMonster Hunter Wilds showcase. But a few details spotlight the changes being made, both in the world and under the hood.
Title Update 1 goes live on Friday April 4, 2025 at 3am UTC / Thursday April 3, 2025 8pm PT. Capcom also provided the required space for the update:
It is Monster Hunter after all, so the new content and hunts take priority.Mizutsunearrives for HR 21 and up hunters in Title Update 1, while aTemperedMizutsune will arrive for HR 41 and up hunters after completing the extra Mizutsune mission. The big bad Zoh Shia is now a high-rank monster, with a story mission unlocking Zoh Shia at HR 50.
Additionally, new story, extra, and side missions will be added, as well as new weapons, armor, and skills. The upgrade limit has been increased for armor of rarity 5 and above, too.
The Grand Hub, an endgame gathering location for hunters. It can be unlocked by doing a tutorial mission appearing once you've hit HR 16, and will host Barrel Bowling, the Arena Quest Counter, the Canteen, the Arm Wrestling Barrel, and the Diva.
There will also be an Expedition Record Board with rankings for time attack quests. Add on new pop-up camp gear options, new pose sets and gestures, and even some new voice lines for Alma, and there's quite a bit of new stuff to see in Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1.
PC players will be happy to see the improvements laid out prior are being implemented in Title Update 1. VRAM usage is being improved, and the DirectStorage version will be upgraded.
Additionally, numerous bug fixes are taking aim at game crashes, disappearing monsters, and the distance between the monster and the camera for certain monsters like Gore Magala.
There are some balance changes as well, though the extent remains to be seen. The Corrupted Mantle in particular has seen its effects ""adjusted,"" while other Mantle options like Rocksteady, Mending, and Evasion all received buffs.
The Bow is also getting some adjustments, with Dragon Piercer damage decreased but Thousand Dragons damage increased, Power Volley elemental values increased, and both Power Shot and Power Volley now affected by the Charge Master skill.
There arefurther updates detailed in the full patch notes here, running down all the fixes and adjustments arriving with Title Update 1 on April 4, 2025. More is expected to roll out after, with new monsters and events carrying on into the summer and Title Update 2. It seems like Capcom is determined to keep the momentum going with Monster Hunter Wilds.
To help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look atwhat Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you, and a guide toall 14 weapon typesin the game. We’ve also got a detailedMH Wilds walkthrough, and aMH Wilds multiplayerguide to explain how to play with friends.

"Originally launched as a free service to rival Xbox Live in 2010, PlayStation Plus has evolved significantly since its humble beginnings in 2010. The current iteration of PlayStation Plus is a subscription-based service for PS5 and PS4 users that is mandatory for online play, but alsofeatures additional tiers that add benefitssuch asa catalog of downloadable games,cloud streaming, and more.

While Sony used to offer free trials for new users to its online service,PlayStation Plus does not currently offer any free trials.
Although PlayStation Plus doesn't offer free trials to everyone, certain countries or regions may occasionally have access to alimited-time free trial according to Sony's website. Unfortunately, Sony doesn't reveal exactlywhothese free trials are for orwhenthey are available, so you'll need to keep your eyes peeled. PlayStation also occasionally hasfree multiplayer eventswith no PS Plus subscription required, although these are often unpredictable.
PlayStationdoeshaveoccasional deals on PlayStation Plus subscriptions, however, they are oftenonly available for new or expired members. Come on, Sony, share the love!
There really isn't adirectreplacement for PS Plus as it's required for online play on PS5 and PS4, but there are some alternatives with free (or close to free) trials that offer a catalog of games to stream, if you so desire. However, most (if not all) of these alternatives require either a different console, a PC, or a mobile device to use the service.
Other services like Ubisoft+ and EA Play feature publisher-specific catalogs of games to stream, but they don't currently offer any free trials.

"As part of its Spring Sale, SteelSeries is taking 35% off bothPS5andXboxeditions of itsSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Destiny 2: The Final Shape Editionwireless gaming headsets. The Destiny Edition comes with a Booster Pack that includes Destiny themed speaker plates and headband, as well as exclusive Destiny 2 in-game items.

The SteelSeries Nova 7 is the latest successor to the highly rated Arctis 7 series of headsets. It's every bit as good as its predecessor but with some welcome upgrades like a USB Type-C charging port, a longer battery life (38 hours vs. 30 hours), simultaneous wireless and Bluetooth connectivity, and multi-platform compatibility. PC gamers also have access to the SteelSeries GG app, which opens up a whole suite of customization for your audio. If that's too much for you, there are presets for specific games that are actually tailormade by the game developers. For PS5 gamers, the Nova 7 is also compatible with the PlayStation 5's Tempest 3D Audio.
The Arctis Nova 7 is one of thebest headsetsyou can get forPS5and PC. In hisNova 7 review, Matthew Adler wrote that ""SteelSeries continues to push the boundaries of what a headset is capable of. With the addition of simultaneous Bluetooth audio, you can enjoy music, podcasts, or just chat with your friends without losing your game audio – all with a single pair of headphones. The Arctis Nova 7’s new design is sleek, lightweight, and still remains one of the most comfortable headsets I’ve ever used."" I own a pair of these myself and highly recommend it.

"One of the biggest reasons for why we remember the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games so fondly is because of the licensed soundtrack. From punk rock to hip-hop, and a new wave of hardcore with the remasters, the series forged our music tastes, and it will continue to do so withTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remastered coming July 11this year. In the lead up to its release, Activision is putting togetherthe official THPS 3 + 4 playlist on Spotifyand continually updating it as it reveals more and more of the song list.

[Editor's note: Activision revealed additional new and returning songs for the game on March 27, 2025, and this article has been updated to include them.]
The first and second waves of tracks have been revealed, and here are the songs we currently know of for the THPS 3 + 4 Remastered soundtrack:
Additionally, those who get the deluxe edition of the game, or access it through Xbox Game Pass, will also get a full band version of the Doom E1M1 theme song ""At Doom's Gate"" as a playable track (along with the Doom Slayer and Revenant skater skins).
Personally, I'd love to hear Guttermouth's ""I'm Destroying the World"" and AFI's ""The Boy Who Destroyed the World"" from THPS 3 make comebacks, as well as Bad Religion's ""Big Bang"" and Flogging Molly's ""Drunken Lullabies"" from THPS 4. That's mostly because I'm a washed up old punk kid. However, it's an opportunity to discover new music and celebrate the scene as it is today, bridging the gap between the new and oldas was the case with THPS 1 + 2 Remasteredfrom 2021.
Those whopreorder THPS 3 + 4 Remastered's deluxe or collector's editioncan access the playable demo sometime in June which will include two parks, two skaters, and a limited soundtrack. An exclusive physical Birdhouse skate deck also comes with the collector's edition. You'll also be able to access the full game early on July 8, three days ahead of its official release date."
"Final Fantasy VII Rebirthis now available at its lowest price so far.Woot is offering the game for $32.99for PS5, a significant drop from its regular price of $69.99. For those who have been waiting to pick it up, this is a great opportunity to do so at a significant discount, and potentially one of the best deals of the year.

It's hard to imagine the game dropping any further in price anytime soon, making this likely the best opportunity to buy it at the lowest price possible in 2025. With such a steep discount, I wouldn't be surprising if it sells out quickly, so if you're interested in picking it up, don't wait too long.
In our 9/10 review, Michael Higham called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth“a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth,” and “an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long.” While it takes some creative liberties in reimagining the classic, he described it as “thrilling and unexpectedly impactful.”
Woot, an Amazon-owned online retailer, is known for offering limited-time deals on video games, tech, and more. It's a trusted source for deep discounts, and one we frequently recommend on IGN for finding some of the best gaming bargains around.

"With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its wayandits audience.

Capcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.
But in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.
2016 was a bad year for Capcom.
The big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.
This was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.
All of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .
Achieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.
Capcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4.
2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema.
Unfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.
“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.
This directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op.
This downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.
But it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.
This slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.
It was clear something needed to change.
By the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability.
While neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.
“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”
Those constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6.
""We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V,"" Nakayama says. ""And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title.""
All this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards.“There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.
“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”
The team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.
There was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master.
“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.”
Street Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series.
While they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.
While Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.
Around the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience.
“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”
If you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.
“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”
Itsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance.
No other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened.
Firstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.
“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”
Monster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.
This created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.
But the reality was that Monster Hunterdidhave fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.
Released in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.
“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”
It was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”
It wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world.
“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”Tsujimoto says.
One important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.
This explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.
“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”
Monster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call.
“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&D teams were divided into R&D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”
Takeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.
There were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.
“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.
The game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series.
But Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time.
“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.
The result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history.
Naturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?
Ampo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”
But despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.
Around the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.
“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.”
Itsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.
The 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. ""Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively,"" Itsuno says. ""When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”
This vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should.
Ampo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, ""So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.”
This meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.
“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”
Since 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.
Focusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat.
But what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.
Many of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever.
When asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”
Monster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”

"One of the most memorable moments in the entire Assassin’s Creed series happens near the start of Assassin’s Creed 3, when Haytham Kenway has finished rounding up his band of assassins in the New World. Or at least, the player is led to believe they’re assassins. Haytham, after all, uses a hidden blade, is just as charismatic as previous series protagonist Ezio Auditore, and has – up until this point in the campaign – played the part of a hero, busting Native Americans out of prison and beating up cocky British redcoats. Only when he utters the familiar phrase, “May the Father of Understanding guide us,” does it become clear we have actually been following our sworn enemies, the Templars.

To me, this surprising setup represents the fullest realization of Assassin’s Creed’s potential. The first game in the series introduced an intriguing concept – find, get to know, and kill your targets – but fell short in the story department, with both protagonist Altaïr and his victims being utterly bereft of personality. Assassin’s Creed 2 took a step in the right direction by replacing Altaïr with the more iconic Ezio, but failed to apply the same treatment to his adversaries, with the big bad of its spinoff Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, Cesare Borgia, coming across as particularly underdeveloped. Only in Assassin’s Creed 3, set during the American Revolution, did the developers at Ubisoft devote as much time to fleshing out the hunted as they did the hunter. It lent the game an organic flow from set-up to payoff and, as a result, achieved a delicate balance between gameplay and narrative that as yet hasn’t been replicated since.
While the current RPG era of the series has largely been well received by players and critics, a wealth of articles, YouTube videos, and forum posts agree that Assassin’s Creed is in decline, and has been for some time. What exactly is responsible for this downfall, however, is subject to debate. Some point to the increasingly unrealistic premises of the modern games, which have you face off against gods like Anubis and Fenrir. Others take issue with Ubisoft’s implementation of a varied spectrum of romance options or, in the hotly-disputed case of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, replacing its hitherto fictional protagonists with a real-world historical figure, an African samurai called Yasuke. My personal nostalgia for the Xbox 360/PS3-era games notwithstanding, I’d argue it’s none of these. Instead, such decline is a result of the series’ gradual abandonment of character-driven storytelling, which has by now gotten buried deep inside its sprawling sandbox.
Over the years, Assassin’s Creed has padded its original action-adventure formula with a slew of RPG and live service-ish elements, from dialogue trees and XP-based levelling systems to loot boxes, microtransaction DLC, and gear customization. But the bigger the new installments have become, the emptier they have started to feel, and not just with regard to the countless climb-this-tower, find-that-object side-missions, but also their basic storytelling.
Although allowing you to choose what your character says or does should theoretically make the overall experience more immersive, in practice I’ve found it often has the opposite effect: as scripts get longer and longer to account for multiple possible scenarios, they feel like they lack the same level of polish as a game with a more limited range of interaction. The focused, screenplay-like scripts of the series’ action-adventure era allowed for sharply defined characters that were not pulled thin by a game structure that demands its protagonist be compassionate or brutal on the whim of the player.
Thus, while a game like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey technically has more content than Assassin’s Creed 2, much of it feels wooden and underbaked. This unfortunately breaks the immersion; it's too often very obvious that you are interacting with computer generated characters rather than complex historical figures. This is in stark contrast to the franchise’s Xbox 360/PS3 era, which in my humble opinion has produced some of the finest writing in all of gaming, from Ezio’s fiery “Do not follow me, or anyone else!” speech after besting Savonarola, to the tragicomic soliloquy Haytham delivers when he is at long last killed by his son, Connor:
“Don't think I have any intention of caressing your cheek and saying I was wrong. I will not weep and wonder what might have been. I'm sure you understand. Still, I'm proud of you in a way. You have shown great conviction. Strength. Courage. All noble qualities. I should have killed you long ago.”
The writing has suffered in other ways over the years, too. Where the modern games tend to stick to the easily digestible dichotomy of Assassins = good and Templars = bad, the earlier games went to great lengths to show that the line between the two orders isn’t as clear-cut as it initially appears. In Assassin’s Creed 3, each defeated Templar uses their last breath to make Connor – and, by extension, the player – question their own beliefs. William Johnson, a negotiator, says the Templars could have stopped the Native American genocide. Thomas Hickey, a hedonist, calls the Assassins’ mission unrealistic and promises Connor that he’ll never feel fulfilled. Benjamin Church, who betrays Haytham, declares it’s “all a matter of perspective,” and that the British – from their point of view – see themselves as the victims, not the aggressors.
Haytham, for his part, tries to shake Connor’s faith in George Washington, claiming the country he’ll create will be no less despotic than the monarchy from which the Americans sought to liberate themselves – an assertion which rings all the more true when we discover that the command to burn down Connor’s village wasn’t given by Haytham’s henchman Charles Lee, as previously thought, but Washington. By the end of the game, the player has more questions than answers – and the story is stronger for it.
Looking back on the franchise’s long history, there is a reason why one track from the Jesper Kyd-composed Assassin’s Creed 2 score, “Ezio’s Family,” resonated with players to the point of becoming the series’ official theme. The PS3 games, particularly Assassin’s Creed 2 and Assassin’s Creed 3, were – at their core – character-driven experiences; the melancholic guitar strings of “Ezio’s Family” weren’t meant to evoke the game’s Renaissance setting so much as Ezio’s personal trauma of losing his family. As much as I admire the expansive worldbuilding and graphical fidelity of the current generation of Assassin’s Creed games, my hope is that this out-of-control franchise will someday scale itself down, and once again deliver the kind of focused, tailor-made stories that made me fall in love with it in the first place. Sadly, in a landscape dominated by sprawling sandboxes and single-player games with live service-style ambitions, I fear that’s just not “good business” anymore.

"Gaming hardware company ASUS has pulled back the curtain at what may be the reported Xbox-branded handheld device.

The ASUS Republic of Gamers X/Twitter account shared ateasershowing its ""little robot friend cooking something up,"" offering a brief glimpse at both a Republic of Gamers (ROG) Xbox controller and handheld system.
Last month, IGN reported on Microsoft’s video game hardware ambition, which allegedly includes a full next-gen Xbox for 2027 and anXbox-branded gaming handheld that may launch later in 2025.
That's not our only clue, either. The handheld shown in ASUS's teaser clearly shows off buttons configured for Xbox (Y, B, A, and X, rather than PlayStation's triangle, circle, cross, and square, or Nintendo's X, A, B, and Y). There's also a D-pad, two thumbsticks, and four smaller additional buttons, although it's pretty hard to make those out clearly.
Perhaps most interestingly of all, though, the official Xbox accountacknowledged the tweetwith a cheeky wide-eyed gif, suggesting this is all setting up a reveal.
pic.twitter.com/ONZpeEmNka
Unfortunately, that's all we have. There's no date on the reveal yet, let alone a concrete launch window, but the monitor the little robot is working on states ""Marathon stamina, more capacity, faster speeds"" and ""fresh look!"" giving us an idea of what the handheld's unique selling points may be.
In January, Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s VP of ‘Next Generation,’ toldThe Vergethat the company plans to combine Xbox and Windows experiences together for PC gaming handhelds made by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), otherwise known as third-party hardware manufacturers. Existing PC gaming OEMs include ASUS, Lenovo, and Razer.
While this Xbox-branded gaming handheld is not a Microsoft-made console, the company is reportedly planning to finally launch one of its own in 2027, potentially alongside its next-gen Xbox.Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer recently indicated a first-party Xbox handheld is years away.
Speaking of which, the successor to the Xbox Series X is now allegedly ""fully"" in production and due out in two years, tying in with Xbox president Sarah Bond's recent comments thatMicrosoft was ""moving full speed ahead on our next generation hardware, focused on delivering the biggest technological leap ever in a generation.""
For some time now, there's been much speculation around the future of consoles, with Netflix's President of Games, Alain Tascan, recently stating that he expectsa future generation that relies less on gaming consolesdespite major players like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo pushing forward with new hardware. The latter'shighly anticipated Switch 2 devicewill be showcased in a Nintendo Direct on April 2, with many fans expecting to hear more aboutwhat features the Switch 2 brings to the table, its release date, andhow pre-orders will be managed.

"Having launched in 2019, Apple TV+ is one of the youngest streaming services available today. Over the years, the Apple-owned platform has grown into a powerhouse of original TV shows, likeTed LassoandSeverance, as well as movies likeKillers of the Flower Moon. While it may not release new content at the same pace as something like Netflix, Apple TV+ is only a fraction of the price and comes bundled with just about every new Apple device purchase, making it easier than ever to check out its growing library. Below, we'll break down what Apple TV+ is as a service, how much it costs, and how to sign up for a free trial.

Apple TV+ offers a 7-day free trial for all new subscribers. Simply head over to theApple TV+ homepageor app and you'll be greeted with a button that says ""Accept Free Trial."" NewiPhones,iPads, Apple TVs, and Mac computers also come bundled with a 3-month Apple TV+ trial, which requires manual activation through the Apple TV app on the device. In both cases, once your trial ends, your subscription will automatically renew at the standard monthly rate of $9.99/month.
Apple TV+ is an award-winning streaming service featuring Apple Originals — exclusive series, movies, documentaries, and more, with new content added every month. While it was a bit barebones when it launched in 2019, Apple TV+ has grown its library to over 180 series, with breakout hits like Ted Lasso, Severance, and Silo, as well as over 80 original films, including Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. Apple TV+ was also thefirst streaming service to receive an Academy Award for its original film CODA, which released in 2022.
While Apple TV+ may not boast a massive library like Netflix, it's long maintained a ""quality over quantity"" approach when it comes to its original programming with something that will surely appeal to just about anyone, regardless of age.
Apple TV+ is one of the least-expensive streaming services at $9.99/month.Since there's no ads by default, there's no ad-supported or limited tiers to worry about.
Aside from standalone subscriptions, Apple TV+ is included in a bundled service calledApple One. The lowest-tier Apple One plan gives you access to four subscriptions: Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and a 50GB iCloud+ plan, all for $19.95/month. The Premier Apple One plan costs $37.95/month, adding Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, and an upgrade to 2TB of iCloud+ storage.
If you're a current college or university student, you can sign up for aApple Music plan that includes Apple TV+at a discounted rate of $5.99/month. Apple Music usually costs $10.99/month on its own, so this is quite the deal.
Treated as a separate subscription, Apple TV also hosts Major League Soccer streams. TheMLS Season Passstarts at $14.99/month, and Apple TV+ subscribers get a $2 discount.
Apple TV+ is available to stream on all of your Apple devices including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV set-top boxes. Additionally, you can stream Apple TV+ on a variety of internet-connected smart TVs, Roku devices, Amazon Fire TV devices, Google TV devices, as well as PlayStation and Xbox consoles. You can also AirPlay from an Apple device to any compatible AirPlay device that doesn't feature the native Apple TV+ app.

"New details about what's in store for the horrors waiting withinSilent Hill fhave emerged, and they make it clear that developer NeoBards Entertainment is keeping in step with the series' tone.

Warning!The following descriptions contain some gruesome details about the content of Silent Hill f, which will entail possible spoilers and mature content.
Konami airedits latest Silent Hill Transmission broadcast just last week, sharing more details about the upcoming Silent Hill f. Developed by NeoBards, set in a mountain town in 1960s Japan, and written by Higurashi and Umineko author Ryukishi07, Silent Hill f looks to be an interesting new venture for the horror series.
The broadcast didn't include much in the way of gameplay though. In lieu of that, fans have been poring over the content warnings and ESRB rating for Silent Hill f, both of which are live and provide some surprisingly detailed descriptions of what terrors wait in the town of Ebisugaoka.
Over on the ESRB site, Silent Hill f garnered a Mature 17+ rating for ""Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Partial Nudity."" None of that by itself is terribly surprising, but it's the rating summary that offers some more detail:
Faces ripped apart, hot irons, and a character sawing off their arm certainly paint a gruesome picture. Silent Hill f could get pretty gnarly, even by Silent Hill's standards. It is, after all,the first game in the series to earn a CERO:Z in Japan, an 18+ rating; the others have typically garnered CERO:C or CERO:D, which are 15+ and 17+, respectively.
Silent Hill f may also be dealing with some heavy topics and imagery too. For that, we can look at the game's content warning, displayed on boththe official siteand theSteam store page:
Between the actual physical horror and tackling these kinds of themes, Silent Hill f certainly seems like it's engaging with the kind of material you'd expect in a Silent Hill. For horror fans, that's hopefully a good sign.
Silent Hill f has no release date at the moment, though having an ESRB rating this detailed certainly suggests it's not far off. It's currently targeting PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC when it does launch.

"You don't have to wait for the new 2025 LG TVs to drop to score a great deal on an older generation model. Right now, you can pick up a 202365"" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TVfor just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday. The LG Evo C-series of TVs have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVs, especially for 4K HDR movies and gaming.

The LG Evo C3 is a 2023 model, just one year behind the 2024 LG Evo C4. So what are the differences? Aside from the $650 price difference, not much. The most important trait -- picture quality -- is more or less identical. Where the C4 improves on the C3 are an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate.
OLED TVs are considered the best TVs you can buy right now. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, they offer better image quality, deeper blacks, better contrast ratio, wider color gamut, and super fast response times. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV are easily the best type of TV for viewing 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations.
The LG C3 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel and all four HDMI 2.1 ports for running 4K at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. It also supports variable refresh rate (VRR), auto low latency mode (ALLM), and DTS audio, which is good for people who still watch Blu-ray discs. The C3 is also much easier to set up than its predecessors; the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that drops the weight to a mere 36 pounds.
The LG Evo C-series TV is ourfavorite high-end 4K TV of 2025because of the brilliance of its OLED display along with a host of quality features that don't quite push it to the point of an excessively high price. This model brings better contrast and clarity than the previous year's already luminous LG C2. It’s a sight to behold, especially when you add in the deep blacks and well-balanced colors on the crisp 4K screen. Once you choose OLED, it's hard to go back to anything else.
The LG Evo C5 hasn't yet been released, butit was showcased during CES 2025. At least on paper, the improvements of the C5 seem to be incremental, with no major ground breaking updates that would make you want to hold off until its launch. More importantly, the C5 will probably release at a very high retail price which will take months to get down to a level that's competitive with other TV deals.

"Backbone has justreleased an Xbox version of the Backbone One, its crtically acclaimedmobile controller. This model sports a translucent green that's reminiscent of the old Xbox controllers, but it also has a dedicated Xbox home button that will automatically boot up the Xbox app on your phone. This adds a level of convenience for those who frequently play games via the cloud on Xbox Game Pass.

The Backbone One Xbox Edition connects through USB-C, making it compatible with any moderniOSandAndroid smartphone. Its backing frame collapses, letting you fold it and store it easily when not in use, and it's telescoping so you can slide it out and fit several phone sizes.
You can get the Backbone One Xbox Editiondirectly from Backboneorat Best Buyfor $109.99. It also comes with a free one-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for new members.
In our initialBackbone One reviewfor iPhones back in 2021, author Matthew Adler concluded, ""The Backbone One’s unique expanding controller connects directly to your iPhone for a low-latency gaming experience that feels great to use... The tight integration between hardware and software makes it feel like a real platform, and one that will only continue to evolve through updates as time goes on."""
"Microsoft will bring Rockstar Games’Grand Theft Auto 5to Xbox Game Pass and GTA 5 Enhanced to Game Pass for PC on April 15.

This striking addition to the Wave 1 April 2025 lineup was announced in anXbox Wire post, revealing that the service’s biggest new title of the month is only a few weeks away from dropping. It’s an especially enticing reveal, as the PC Game Pass version of GTA 5 comes with that all-new Enhanced update Rockstar dropped in early March.
“No matter what version you’re playing, everyone will have access toOscar Guzman Flies Again, the latest update where you can take to the skies — taking control of the McKenzie Field Hanger in Grapeseed,” an official description from Xbox explained. “Play new arms trafficking missions, fly new aircraft, and more.”
Its arrival in two Tuesdays will mark a triumphant return to Game Pass after Rockstar’s open-world masterpiece was previously removed from the service. However, while the addition will mark the title's first time on PC Game Pass, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows as far as many die-hard GTA fans are concerned.
GTA 5 Enhanced arrived on PC March 4as a free update, bringing access to all the latest vehicles, performance upgrades in Hao’s Special Works, animal encounters, and visual bumps. It was a promising addition that also resulted in GTA 5 becomingRockstar’s worst-reviewed title on Steamas players latched onto account migration issues that kept them from bringing their GTA Online profiles over to the new version.
If you’re a newcomer to Los Santos, then you likely won’t have much to worry about. If you’re returning to the world of GTA 5 Online and looking to migrate your account over to that shiny new Enhanced upgrade, you might find yourself out of luck. For now, it appears the issues with account migration are still ongoing.
Meanwhile, we’re still waiting for any news aboutGrand Theft Auto 6. Our last GTA 6 update ensured thatRockstar intended to deliver its next open-world trend-setter sometime this fall, though we’restill waiting on that elusive release date.
While Rockstar works out the kinks ahead of GTA 5’s return to Game Pass, you can read up onthe rest of the Wave 1 April 2025 titles coming to Xbox Game Pass. You can also read up on how Rockstar is supporting the modding community bygranting them access to official tools.

"LG's most popular current generation OLED TV has been discounted starting today. Right now Amazon has dropped the price of the65"" LG Evo C4 4K OLED TVto $1,396.99. The LG Evo C-series of TVs - including this model - have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVsfor HDR movie watching and current generation console gaming.

More importantly, the C5 will probably release at a very high retail price which will take months to get down to a level that's competitive with other TV deals.
The C4 uses LG's Evo panel, which offers higher brightness levels than traditional OLED TVs. Compared to a standard LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. Because of these advantages, the Evo OLED TV excels at displaying 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations.
The LG C4 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz and all four HDMI ports are 2.1 spec for running games in 4K at up to 120fps on a PS5 or Xbox Series X without any tearing.

"Palworldhas a big new update that adds crossplay across all platforms among many other new features.

Update v0.5.0 also lets players store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds. A new storage system has 10 times the capacity of the regular Palbox. Not only can guild members access it, but it can be used as a personal storage with private settings.
Elsewhere, you can now change your character’s appearance without affecting armor stats (transmog), there’s a photo mode, blueprint upgrading, and dedicated servers for Mac, among other changes detailed in the patch notes below.
Developer Pocketpair said it’s working on adding dedicated servers for the PlayStation 5 version and will release them at some point in the future.
Palworld has had an incredible32 million playerssince its early access launch in January 2024. The studio haslaid out a content roadmap for Palworld's 2025that looks fairly lengthy; alongside crossplay, there is an ""ending scenario"" and more new content on the way for the hugely popular creature-catching survival game.
Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC a year ago, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developercouldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success,signing a deal with Sonyto form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP, and launching the game on PS5.
Looming over all this isa lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, who seek ""an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages"" on the grounds that Palworld has allegedly infringed on ""multiple"" patent rights.Pocketpair has provided an update, identifying the patents the studio is allegedly infringing, and it has since tweaked how players summon Pals in Palworld, apparently in response. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in court, saying: “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”

This is a brand new and retail boxed product that is stocked in a US warehouse and qualifies for local delivery, which means it ships free and arrives quickly.

This genuine PlayStation console is imported from another country, however it will play in the US without any modifications. That's because region locking is determined by your PlayStationaccount, not by your system hardware. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. Note that imported consoles have an overseas warranty that won't be honored here in the United States. Fortunately, AliExpress has a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days.
AliExpress as a whole is a legitimate website, but since it is a marketplace comprised of individual sellers, you have to make sure that the vendor you're buying from is reputable. In many cases, the easiest way to do so is to look at the seller's rating and history. In terms of the products we've listed in this article, while it's true that some of the sellers may not have many reviews,AliExpress has reached out to us and personally vetted these vendors, which is why we feel comfortable promoting them.

"Don’t hold your breath forThe Witcher 4. According to the developers at CD Projekt, it won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest.

Speaking in afinancial calloutlining projections of future profits, CD Projekt said: “Even though we do not plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026, we are still driven by this financial goal. And although it’s very ambitious, we stand a chance of achieving it within the given timeframe.”
That rules out a launch this year, which no-one really expected, a launch next year, which some had hoped for, and sets 2027 as the earliest The Witcher 4 will come out. But that’s if everything goes to plan, and as we all know, the video game industry has a hard time with its plans. Could The Witcher 4 end up being a 2028 game? It sounds possible.
Either way, 2027 at the earliest suggests The Witcher 4 may well end up targeting the next-generation of consoles, with Sony no-doubt working on its PlayStation 6 plans as we speak, andMicrosoft rumored to be targeting a 2027 release for its Xbox Series X successor and an Xbox handheld. But is it a cross-gen game, as Cyberpunk 2077 was when it released in December 2020?
If it is a cross-gen game, with a version for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, could The Witcher 4 end up working on Nintendo Switch 2? It seems unlikely at face value, but The Witcher 3 ended up on the Switch, so miracles do happen.
Here's what we know: The Witcher 4 is the first in a new trilogy of Witcher games set after the events of The Witcher 3. But rather than star Geralt as protagonist, Ciri is the main character this time around.
Speaking exclusively to IGN ahead of The Witcher 4 reveal, executive producer Małgorzata Mitręga said Ciri was “the very organic, logical choice.”
“It was always about her, starting from Saga when you read it in the books. She's an amazing, layered character. And of course, as a protagonist we said goodbye to Geralt previously. So this is a continuation. I guess for all of us it’s like she was meant to be. That was always her.”
In January, speaking to IGN as part of a wider interview on Netflix’s upcoming animated film,The Witcher: Sirens of The Deep,Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle backed CD Projekt’s decision, even though it sees Geralt take a back seat.
“I'm really excited,” he said. “I think it's a really good move. I mean, I always thought that continuing the Saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons, but mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because people, I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done.”
And in February,the director ofThe Witcher 4clarified that a new video featured the same in-game model of Ciri after some had thought her face looked different.
We’ve got plenty more exclusive content on The Witcher 4, includinga trailer breakdownand an interview with CD Projekt where the developer explainswhy The Witcher 4 will avoid a Cyberpunk 2077-style launch disaster.

"Rejoice, fellow Nintendo fans. On Wednesday, the clouds parted, the sun rose, and the divine spectra; hand of Miyamoto reached down from the sky to grace us with Nintendo’s newest handheld carnival of joy, the Switch 2. After years of speculation, we finally have a clear look at the mysterious console hybrid.

Sadly, while sleek, compact, and powerful, the rumours are untrue. The Switch 2 does not in fact pack a tiny little Reggie into every GPU. But after we spent an hour during the Direct glued to every word: dissecting it, screenshotting every image, poring over captured video for tiny clues to its form and function, we can finally apply something besides guesswork and give you some solid facts, including all the ways it leaves its beloved predecessor in the dust.
This is probably the least-surprising revelation as practically every next-gen Nintendo console has been significantly improved over its predecessor (yes, even the Wii). Still, when released in 2017, Switch was hardly a cutting-edge powerhouse in comparison to Sony and Xbox consoles, and eight years later it noticeably struggles under demanding games. Nintendo and its partners were increasingly running up against the limitations of the hardware.
This week we saw elements on display promising us a vastly improved experience: handheld resolutions up to 1080p, docked up to 4K, both with HDR, and framerates extending up to 120 fps. It’s a welcome upgrade that should allow a wider variety of games to come to Switch 2. We may already see some of the fruit in EA’s decision to host soccer and football games on Switch 2, and 2K’s intention to do the same with wrestling and basketball.
Third parties revealed all manner of current-gen games to give us some idea of the Switch 2’s increased capabilities, and what we saw was encouraging: a console/handheld capable of handling Elden Ring, Street Fighter 6, and other demanding software. And what Nintendo showed of their new first-party offerings was simply gorgeous.
The little purple lunchbox that could finally comes to Nintendo Switch Online, exclusively available on Switch 2. Nintendo has effectively drawn a fence between online experiences on Switch and Switch 2, and that means that from this point forward those who want to play some of Nintendo’s best retro games are going to have to shell out for better hardware. Sure, it’s only three games right now, but those three games are absolute bangers: The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and, holy crap, Soul Calibur 2, complete with Link.
Okay, seriously. Soul Calibur 2 is incredible. If you’ve never played it with a friend you are in for such a treat.
When humanity later reviews and catalogues the glorious day in video game history, the opening chapter won’t be about how Mario Kart is now like Forza Horizon, or about Donkey Kong’s return in Bananza, or even about the announcement of the until-now secret project called Duskblood. Instead, the book will open and perhaps also close with the most significantly un-Nintendo thing to happen this week: easy integration of online features commonly available on other platforms.
The company that brought us Friend Codes now graces us with GameChat, a feature-rich communication and visual sharing feature set for Switch 2. A noise-cancelling mic picks up your voice and shares it with friends. An optional desktop camera allows you to share your face, both in window-corners and in compatible games like Mario Party. You can also share screens across consoles remotely. It’s much of what we gave up on asking Nintendo for years ago... a simple, straightforward tool for playing with friends. I’m looking forward to seeing how it actually plays out.
So much potential awaits with this feature. Where my mind keeps going is Monster Hunter, with teams of four benefitting from shared screens as they pursue and trap their prey. It’s simply become unthinkable for Nintendo to voluntarily offer fans such a useful array of online features, but here we are living in the future at last.
Okay, we’d already guessed this but it’s still really cool. Joy-Cons now magnetically snap to the Switch 2 body rather than slotting in. Nintendo showed off how the steel shoulder buttons on each controller attract to the magnetic facing along the sides of the screen, locking them together. A press of a button releases the magnetic grip.
This is a pretty great feature for my home setup, where a shelf top obstructs removing the Joy-Cons without removing the entire Switch from the dock, which sometimes leads to knocking the whole thing down. I’m a fan.
Bigger isn’t always better with handhelds, but given the sharper resolution of the 1080p portable screen and the nature of most Switch games, the slight increase in size to 7.9 inches should be a net gain for most players. The first Switch sacrificed screen real estate for portability but I think Nintendo is making the right call in giving these elaborate, feature -rich games more space to shine.
Nintendo was weirdly excited to show off its innovative Joy-Con mouse features. A Switch 2 Joy-Con laid on its side can be scooted across a tabletop, and its telemetry tracked to provide precise pointing and rotation. It looks to be heavily-supported at launch by games like Drag x Drive, Civ 7, and Metroid Prime 4.
I do love wacky Nintendo. My guess is the mouse feature won’t see much use past launch window (much like the microphone on the old DS) but I’m actually 1000% in on playing Metroid Prime 4 with a mouse. As a PC gamer, I rarely enjoy FPS games that force me to use a controller, so this surprising option feels a bit liberating. Hopefully we get Mario Paint 2.
This one is more of a double-edged sword. Nintendo crammed the Switch 2 with 256GB of external storage, much more than the original Switch. But with all the Switch 2’s extra graphics capacity, those asset-rich game files are going to be much bigger too, so it may be close to a wash. The memory is quicker as well to deal with larger game files, which means you’ll need a new, faster memory card for your supplemental storage.
Nintendo tweaked the Switch hardware in response to nearly a decade of feedback. Switch 2 now features two USB-C ports, with one added on top to assist in charging while playing in kickstand mode. Nintendo added a fan to the doc to aid in cooling consistency. Sticks are larger and sound capabilities are improved.
Even the Switch 2 Pro Controller is a step up, with an audio jack (at last!) and assignable buttons. No telling yet if the new controller contains the same miniaturized star that exists at the core of every Switch Pro Controller, giving it near-unlimited battery life.
And one of the most subtle features might be most useful. I do a fair bit of Switch playing on my tabletop. The fact that the Switch 2 screen angle is adjustable in kickstand mode is a huge deal for me. Too often, ambient light at an airport or the angle of a tight airplane tray table make playing in kickstand seem like an exercise in futility. But with the ability to subtly shift angles, coupled with the new mouse feature, leads me to believe I might actually be able to enjoy a serious game of Civilization 7 on the go.
So first off, Switch 2 is backward compatible. That’s always good. Microsoft has already blazed a pretty amazing trail toward optimized backward compatibility on Xbox, and Nintendo has also wisely taken a note from its own Gamecube to Wii to WiiU history, making most Switch games a snap to play on new hardware. Backward capacity helps sell consoles their first year.
While the Nintendo Switch 2 is backward compatible with Switch games, it also supports special new Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of certain Switch titles like Metroid Prime 4. These enhanced titles offer new features including a selection between a higher-res Quality Mode or a faster frame rate in Performance Mode.
One really cool feature of these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions is that if you already own the original game on Switch, you will be able to purchase a simple Switch 2 Edition upgrade and enjoy all the new features on your new hardware.  Let's hope it's not too expensive.
It’s also possible that Switch 2 Editions of Switch’s notoriously-janky Pokemon games could be improved by these features. Let's hope so. Throwing hardware at things can’t solve every problem but sometimes it really helps.
Mario Kart World does everything we expect of Mario Kart and adds two key elements. The first is the ability to traverse a continuous world Forza Horizon-style, racing from course to course, free mode exploring, fooling around, and so on. The second is the swelling of the field size to 24 carts, which is, well, a lot to get one’s head around when the shells start flying. It sounds like absolute bedlam. I can’t wait.
Nintendo took its time showing off new games but toward the end of the show we bought about a minute tease of a new Kirby’s Air Ride game, Kirby’s Air Riders, an announcement that would likely have resulted in a thunderous snooze were it not for the surprising involvement of one Mr. Sakurai, known equally for his self-immolating work ethic and his status as god of Smash Bros. I love Kirby, but Air Ride sucked... BUT it’s Sakurai so I’m now 100% in.
Then there was The Duskbloods, a trailer that produced some hysterics in me. At first I thought it was Bloodborne 2, then I thought it was a licensed FROM Software take on Castlevania, and then finally I accepted that what I was seeing was an entirely original Miyazaki game exclusive to Switch. My friends, remember: FROM Software does not miss. Probably you will die. Probably you will dodge roll. Certainly you will have a blast.
And of course; the real King of Kong makes his triumphant return to 3D with Donkey Kong Bananza. It’s a moment of absolution for Nintendo: 26 years after dropping the barbequed turd Donkey Kong 64 on an unsuspecting planet, a wiser, more skilled Nintendo has returned to the drawing board with what’s sure to be a landmark adventure.
Nintendo devs have been absolutely murdering 3D platforming on the Switch, not just with Odyssey and Bowser’s Fury, but also with Kirby’s incredible journey to the shores of the Forgotten Lands. Bananza was constructed to showcase far more capable hardware than these modern-day classics, which means that the devs had opportunities to iterate on ideas that wouldn’t have been possible on a basic Switch.

"Um dos gêneros mais populares e importantes dos videogames na última década foi o soulslike. Encabeçado pela FromSoftware e títulos como Dark Souls, Bloodborne e, mais recentemente, Elden Ring, essa categoria derivada dos RPGs de ação reverbera sucessos há 10 anos. Para embarcar nessa onda, a desenvolvedora Neople e a publicadora Nexon criaram The First Berserker: Khazan, novo soulslike baseado no universo do aqui no Brasil quase desconhecido Dungeon Fighter Online, que deixa as raízes de Dark Souls de lado para se inspirar em Nioh e nos soulslikes da Team Ninja.
Durante as minhas mais de 35 horas de jogo, pude encontrar muitas qualidades no combate e construção de builds baseadas nos inúmeros itens que podemos combinar, mas me senti extremamente entediado com um level design fraco, uma repetição de inimigos no mínimo esquisita e personagens desinteressantes. The First Berserker: Khazan é um jogo muito intenso para o bem e para o mal, mas consegue demonstrar proeminência naquilo que se propõe a ser: um soulslike desafiador.
Com uma narrativa um tanto quanto comum em histórias de brucutus em busca de vingança, o jogo segue esse mesmo caminho e nos apresenta Khazan, um poderoso general do império de Pell Los, que é condenado injustamente e exilado para montanhas nevadas por traição ao imperador. No entanto, o acaso do destino faz com que ele seja “salvo” por um espírito maligno que o possui e assim começa uma longa jornada de vingança. A premissa é bastante básica, mas a extensão do universo faz com que a narrativa ganhe camadas de profundidade, embora nenhuma delas consiga tornar o enredo cativante de verdade.
Mesmo com reviravoltas mirabolantes, a trama de traição se mantém clichê do início ao fim e em diversos momentos é sonolenta. Os personagens de suporte também são imemoráveis e apenas uma se destacou para mim entre aliados e inimigos: Elamein. Apesar de o vilão ser bom, ele não sustenta a trama fraca. A história é definitivamente o ponto mais baixo do jogo, mas que não pesa tanto graças ao combate sólido e eficiente – pelo menos na maioria das vezes.
O ponto de maior destaque e brilho de The First Berserker: Khazan é, sem dúvidas, o combate. Extremamente fluido, veloz, intenso, cheio de variedade de armas e habilidades. O game é um soulslike bastante voltado para o parry, mas não de uma forma semelhante a Sekiro. Aqui, a ausência de escudo obriga você a dominar a habilidade de aparar ataques e de desviar no momento certo, porém a esquiva é curta e muitas vezes é a pior opção para escapar de ataques.
Quando partirmos para o ataque, no entanto, vemos aqui onde a equipe da Neople depositou grande parte dos esforços. Khazan é como uma mistura de Kratos, o Chosen One de Dark Souls e o Lobo de Sekiro — tudo isso parece confuso, mas quando o controlamos as coisas se alinham. O jogo apresenta três opções de arma: lanças, empunhadura dupla com espada e machado e, por fim, a espada de duas mãos. Na minha gameplay, optei pela lança na maior parte do tempo, afinal, o dano me pareceu mais equilibrado e a velocidade de ataque me satisfez mais.
O crescimento da jogabilidade é exponencial: no começo temos combos simples e ataques com dardo — semelhante ao arco e flecha. No entanto, conforme aprofundamos a vasta árvore de habilidades de Khazan, as lutas se tornam mais fluidas, sangrentas e polidas de certa forma. Mesmo assim, não pude deixar de observar que em algumas situações a hitbox me pareceu meio confusa e até mesmo problemática, tanto para inimigos quanto para armadilhas do cenário, mas foram casos bem específicos e que não se repetiram.
Os combos de lança são dinâmicos e se encaixaram perfeitamente na minha gameplay. Consegui acabar com inimigos rapidamente, mas precisamos falar sobre o equilíbrio de dificuldade muito peculiar que o jogo apresenta.
Quanto às batalhas de chefe, algumas são básicas, desde a música e movimentos do inimigo até as arenas, enquanto outras mostram o potencial do jogo e exigem o uso máximo das mecânicas de The First Berserker. Na minha experiência pessoal, nenhuma delas merece grande destaque, exceto a batalha final que é digna de um grande RPG de ação pela magnitude do combate.
Um grande destaque do jogo é a criação de builds que se baseia muito nos sistemas de Nioh. É possível ter muito controle dos status do personagem e adaptar Khazan para a sua arma e jogabilidade. Itens do mesmo set concedem bônus conforme você equipá-los e acumular status.
O único sistema ruim de combate é o de invocações, que não ajudam em nada durante as batalhas de chefe e muitas vezes apenas atrapalham. No entanto, os fantasmas são um bom suporte em lutas rotineiras.
Obviamente, por ser um soulslike, The First Berserker: Khazan possui uma dificuldade acentuada, mas os picos de complexidade em progredir no jogo são… esquisitos. Alguns chefes e mapas iniciais são muito difíceis, enquanto algumas batalhas intermediárias contra inimigos de elite e até mesmo os chefões não apresentam desafio, e, por fim, as batalhas mais avançadas são surpreendentemente fáceis. Isso seria normal caso esses picos de dificuldade fossem parte da progressão que, obviamente, fica menos complexa conforme o avançar do jogo, mas The First Berserker tem uma inconsistência de dificuldade que, a meu ver, mostra uma falha de balanceamento no jogo que empobrece a experiência.
Um dos maiores destaques da FromSoftware em Dark Souls é o mapa minuciosamente conectado que possui atalhos e conexões que exploram a sagacidade dos designers em produzir essas fases. Infelizmente, por optar em se inspirar na Team Ninja e jogos como Nioh e Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, o level design de The First Berserker: Khazan se perde em diversos momentos.
Apesar de contar com áreas vastas e alguns atalhos, muitas regiões do mapa parecem sem vida ou possuem conexões um tanto quanto sem sentido que seriam melhores apenas colocando outra espada da fenda, a “bonfire” do game, para tornar a ligação entre áreas dos biomas mais inteligentes. O jogo poderia olhar mais para Lies of P e criar um level design muito melhor, mas se inspirou justamente em soulslikes com design de mapa problemáticos.
A má qualidade do level design se alinha à repetitividade de inimigos, aspecto ainda mais evidente quando olhamos para as missões secundárias, que reutilizam esses cenários com pequenas mudanças e tornam o jogo cansativo ao longo do tempo.
The First Berserker: Khazan é intenso para o bem e para o mal. Quando o jogo está imerso em seu combate, criação de builds e algumas batalhas de chefe, ele brilha e muito, quase alcançando a prateleira dos ótimos soulslikes. Contudo, o level design ruim, repetição de inimigos, história sonolenta e dificuldade inconsistente fazem ele cair de patamar e ser só mais um soulslike, embora ainda figure entre os bons títulos do gênero, não mais do que isso. Os amantes de Nioh e de jogatinas difíceis encontrarão muita diversão em mais de 35 horas de campanha."
"In an early chapter of South of Midnight, our protagonist Hazel is coming to grips with her newfound powers - it’s an important tone-setter, because it’s representative of what developer Compulsion Games is trying to do throughout a concise 12-hour runtime. Mythical creatures straight out of folklore from the American South drive a human story that stands as a fantastic example of how the local can be universal, with the grand tapestry of that region's culture and history wrapped around an otherwise fairly straightforward action-adventure game. While there are plenty of aspects of South of Midnight that aren’t necessarily groundbreaking, it’s all uplifted by a clear and well-executed artistic vision that makes it one the more memorable Xbox console exclusives of this generation.

Hazel’s ability to manipulate the magical threads of an ethereal realm is both the weapon she uses to defeat otherworldly demons in combat and the tool she relies on to piece together the tragic pasts of her neighbors and forebears in her hometown of Prospero. It’s a fictional place, but one that’s deeply rooted in the very real experience of the South – traces of its dark history litter the dilapidated houses after a treacherous flood, contrasting with the remnants of communities that struggled to survive in those harsh conditions. These touches provide the rich context South of Midnight is working within while also unraveling a larger story about the pain, guilt, and trauma many of us experience in our own family lives.
From a gameplay perspective, South of Midnight is rather simple – you’re ushered through fairly linear levels that alternate between platforming and combat encounters, with a few secrets hidden off the beaten path like journal entries from the locals that enrich the story and extra upgrades for your powers and health. If you’ve scaled cliffsides in Uncharted, God of War, or Tomb Raider, its frequent climbing sections will feel pretty familiar – but with the authentic sights and sounds of the American South at the forefront, the detailed vistas, ramshackled towns, or rushing rivers create a strong sense of place. With Hazel’s weaving powers, you’ll zip through air, clear paths forward, or summon ethereal objects depending on what obstacles are in front of you. There isn’t really much tofigure outper se, although there is an enjoyable momentum as you’re funneled from one fight to the next, or when you’re trying to outrun evil spirits chasing you down in the lengthy platforming sequences that cap off every major chapter.
Combat itself is contained in distinct arenas across each level, with the idea being that Haints – the demonic manifestations of peoples’ pain and sorrow – plague all of Prospero, and Hazel is the one who can cleanse that corruption. It’s a comfortable, if predictable, cadence that doesn’t really wear thin since it’s judicious about when you actually have to fight. This helps South of Midnight not feel repetitive, and I genuinely looked forward to each combat encounter. Similar to the platforming, these fights aren’t really pushing any boundaries, but Hazel's attack combos and spells have a certain chunkiness that I really enjoyed. That’s especially true when firing off her stun weaves and grappling strand to stack damage, then leaving a burst behind with a perfect dodge. Cycling through a shortlist of fun abilities like that makes the basics satisfying.
Haints come in various forms that give encounters enough variety. Some are swift and pesky, while others are hulking beasts that tunnel underground and cause massive area-of-effect damage. They’re mixed and matched throughout, and things like Hazel’s puppet named Crouton, who can temporarily control enemies, add an interesting wrinkle when thinking about which targets to prioritize. There are a few boss fights to heighten the stakes with a bit of spectacle as well, but they mostly tend to highlight the formulaic nature of combat by relying on derivative versions of mechanics that are used elsewhere.
South of Midnight’s foundation is perfectly competent, but it’s everything else around it that makes it truly stand out, grabbing you with its painterly character designs and striking stop-motion animation style. That unconventional choice helps special moments pop during cutscenes, although it isn’t really noticeable in the action – and if you find it too jarring, you can optionally disable the stop-motion effect altogether. Even without it, the details in characters’ faces, their expressiveness, and the superb voice acting feel like the real reward chapter after chapter. The specific accents and vernacular come across authentically, to the point where I didn’t think twice about them since it all sounded so familiar to me as someone who was born in the region.
Southern gothic folklore hasn’t really been explored in games like this, and South of Midnight showcases how rich it is by bringing these tales to life in ways we rarely see. Mythical creatures embody the pain and suffering of townsfolk, melding broader urban myths with the struggles of specific characters throughout the story. A figure like Florida’s legendary alligator Two-Toed Tom shows up as a boss, while the shapeshifting Rougarou from Cajun tales takes a form I hadn’t heard of before – and Alabama’s Huggin’ Molly has on a fascinating reinterpretation. It’s the sort of amalgamation of folklore that’s wonderful to see as someone who is familiar with some of it, but done in a way that’s still inviting for the uninitiated.
South of Midnight acknowledges the region’s real history in subtle and effective ways as well, recognizing that remnants of slavery and the Reconstruction era persist in our modern world, and that trauma can carry across generations. Passing by abandoned houses along the bayou with eviction notices from greedy landgrabbers reminds you of the rough and unfair economic conditions many of these communities face. It’s woven into its main themes about the complicated dynamics of family – the best and worst parts that can come from blood relations. With her weaving powers, Hazel can peer into the past through visions recreated using the threads that make up The Grand Tapestry – the flow of all life and memory. You’ll see a mother risking life and limb to escape abuse and give their child a fighting chance; A man ashamed of his brother who takes drastic measures to separate himself, only to live with regret forever; A kid who called out to a mythical creature in desperation to escape his abusive father.
From tragic displays of unconditional love to the horrors of the abuse our own kin can inflict on us, South of Midnight focuses on the idea of family being something we either embrace or reckon with, told in a way that’s inseparable from its setting. Through it all, Hazel is desperately chasing any possible thread to find her mother after that devastating flood at the start, but is still willing to lend a helping hand to the spirits that have endured in the afterlife. As you uncover the hard work her mom puts in as a social worker, it shows that a little empathy can go a long way.
There’s a lot I love about the stories in South of Midnight – I do wish they were more elegant or told with more finesse, however. The larger plot is missing some necessary connective tissue at times, and it’s easy to lose track of why Hazel’s journey leads from one thing to another. Characters and narrative threads are sometimes introduced as quickly as they’re resolved through story beats that feel segmented in ways that aren’t entirely clear. There are parts of Hazel’s life I’m still wondering about that get brought up as important pieces to the story, and I wish I could have tied those loose ends together before the credits rolled.
It gets the big picture right, though, and in its exploration of a region as wide-ranging as the American South, there’s an earnest interpretation. While it is also a heavily religious place, the story is more interested in the spirituality that gives rise to these folktales. And it’s not all swamps and basins out there, it’s not just Bourbon street in New Orleans, or a politically hostile place for marginalized folks – those are all part of it, for sure. But I like that we have a story that shows thatpeople live there, and they struggle in ways that are both universal and unique to the region. South of Midnight also understands thathurt people hurt people, and knows it’s not an excuse for the terrible things that pain may drive people to do – it’s a bit of a trope when stories talk about mental health nowadays, but there’s still truth to it, and South of Midnight has its own take by focusing on this concept with regards to family.
Perhaps my favorite touch, however, is how South of Midnight uses its fantastic soundtrack to tie everything together thematically. With a mix of bluegrass, blues, jazz, and American folk tunes that weave in harmonizing choirs, church organs, or banjos and fiddles, it’s a showcase of how important music has been throughout the region’s history. Big story moments are built up through songs written as if a narrator was walking you through what the characters felt and experienced in their life, and they’re queued up at just the right time to propel you forward as you’re playing. It got me in my feelings at times, because there’s not much I love more than a fantastic soundtrack used as an effective storytelling device.
Many of us from the South have a complicated relationship with it. Born in Mississippi and adopting parts of the culture and vernacular as my family and I moved throughout the country, it’ll always have a special place in my heart. I appreciate having a game that helped me reconnect with those roots in a way that was whimsical and harrowing in equal measure, and that’s the sort of value South of Midnight has beyond just being a good action-adventure game – it’s worth playing for a little virtual tour of the South you wouldn’t see otherwise.
South of Midnight is a straightforward but well-executed action-adventure game on the surface, with a simple but satisfying mix of combat and platforming. It’s focused, filling out its 12-hour runtime nicely without ever dragging or relying on unnecessary padding. Beyond those basics, however, is a certain heart and artistry that elevates the whole package, inviting you to peer into the deep American South through its folklore, nature, and culture. It might not be the most profound exploration of family life, but it’s delivered in ways that feel authentic. From its striking art style to the evocative tunes that bring big story moments together, Hazel’s journey is a captivating one no matter where you come from."
"With the Nintendo Switch 2 on the horizon and presumably launching sometime in the Summer,  perhaps it’s a little too late for even one ofthe best Switch controllersandJoy-Con alternativesto hit the market. But I suppose it’s better late than never. The NYXI Hyperion 2 is a vast improvement over the original Switch's stock Joy-Con with smooth Hall Effect analog sticks, clicky buttons, and ergonomic grips. And since the Hyperion 2 can be used while detached from the Switch, it’s even good enough to recommend in place of a Pro controller (although it does not come with a snap-grip). So, if you’re looking to stay with the original Switch for the foreseeable future and are still looking for a Joy-Con upgrade to improve the handheld experience, this is what you want.

Coming for the first Hyperion, the Hyperion 2 sports a much more sensible design – while it’s a bit wider than the normal Joy-Con, it doesn’t have a weird grip style that juts out horizontally. The Hyperion 2 retains a symmetrical shape and looks like it belongs on a Switch. A major perk is the ergonomic grip that fills my hands akin to a Steam Deck, riding the line between being substantial and not being too bulky. There’s a textured surface on each handle that also helps your grip stay secure. This feels like a proper controller to hold and remains relatively lightweight at just 80g each (normal Joy-Cons weigh in around 50g each).
The buttons might take a moment to get used to since they work quite differently from the standard Joy-Con. Both the directional pad and face buttons have a clicky mouse-like actuation. What you get in return is a softer and more responsive button-press that’s lighter on the thumbs – they’re also bigger to make them even easier to use. My only gripe is that they have a little too much wiggle room since they’re not tightly locked in place and don’t feel as stable as they should be.
That mouse-click design extends to the shoulder bumpers (L and R) and triggers (ZL and ZR). Since the Switch doesn’t have analog triggers, the Hyperion 2 is able to have hair triggers without losing functionality. They sport a very short travel distance and are quick to hit while being light to the touch. The bumpers are easy to hit as well and all it takes is a tap to actuation, and it’s responsive enough to press on the side of the bumper as well.
The biggest improvement, however, is in the analog sticks. Not only does the magnetic Hall Effect design solve the issue of stick drift (which has plagued many Switch owners), these are full-fledged analog sticks that rival that of other consoles. You get a full range of motion and a consistent resistance throughout that range – while it’s just a tad stiff to get off the deadzone, they remain smooth to the touch for precise movements.
Most aftermarket controllers nowadays have back buttons, including the Hyperion 2 – you get two programmable buttons (one on each grip) that sits along your middle finger. NYXI struck a good balance between being easy enough to press without too much effort and not being so light that you'd accidentally hit them (unless you’re gripping your Switch like your life depends on it.) However, a knock against them here is that you need to download a mobile app called KeyLinker to program opposite-side inputs to a back button. It’s a woefully unintuitive app that also requires you to unlink the controls from the Switch in order to connect to the app. Every aftermarket controller I’ve used in the past has the ability to program its extra buttons on the fly, and perhaps this particular aspect is a limitation of the Joy-Con design being split, but it’s baffling that NYXI doesn’t make this easier.
The RGB lighting along the ends of the face buttons and d-pad, and around each analog stick, is a nice aesthetic touch. A tiny lighting button on the back of the grips lets you cycle through four different settings: off, rainbow effect, solid color, and breathing solid color. For both solid color settings, you can choose seven different colors by holding the lighting button and using the analog stick to cycle through them. Both grips can have their RGB set independently so you can have your own color combo.
You still get rumble functionality (although not HD rumble) and gyroscope motion controls when using the Hyperion 2 wirelessly. The last standout feature, however, is the Turbo setting. There are rare cases in which it’ll be beneficial, but thankfully it’s very easy to set for the moments it’s useful. Simply hold the Turbo button, press the button you want to set, and let go – doing this once will set the button to repeat while holding it, doing it a second time will make the button repeat without touching it, and a third time will reset the button to normal.
When it comes to evaluating gaming performance, I put about five hours into using the NYXI Hyperion 2. The first game I played was Metroid Prime Remastered, and with it being a first-person adventure/shooter, the Hyperion 2 really shined. Looking around and aiming at targets to lock on was so much easier thanks to the smooth analog sticks, so while you don’t necessarily need super-precise aiming in this game, the more robust sticks made it more enjoyable. Jumping is already set to one of the bumpers, but that also freed up both back buttons to be used for inputs like weapon switching or going into Morph Ball mode, which was convenient for me. Here, the Turbo function came in clutch – I set it to ZR so I could rapid-fire by holding ZR instead of having it do a charge shot, and I set the MR back button to shoot normally so I could still do charged shots when I needed.
Doing some cleanup in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was a ton of fun since I love exploring Hyrule for unfinished business, but again, it’s a great game for showcasing the Hyperion 2’s capabilities. I still prefer gyro aiming for making those minute adjustments, but the sticks are so precise that sometimes you don’t need motion controls, especially since the sticks recognize small movements off the deadzone. And having a back button for the sprint action is a godsend for me as well since I can keep controlling the camera at the same time.
I tend to avoid first-person shooters on Switch primarily for performance reasons, but also because playing handheld with the standard Joy-Con is straight-up bad. Like other great Joy-Con alternatives, the Hyperion 2 remedies the problem with its fantastic analog sticks that are on par with that of the Xbox Series X|S gamepad to make aiming much better – I’d even go as far to say that the nimble micro-switch triggers make firing and aiming-down-sights quicker and lighting on my fingers.
NYXI rates the Hyperion 2 to have a 10-meter wireless connection distance, which is a little over 30 feet, and that’s accurate. I never had any issues with connectivity when using it detached from the Switch. But since the Hyperion 2 does not come with a center grip to hold the two parts together, I can’t fully recommend it as a Pro controller replacement until one becomes available – that’s a bummer because every other aspect of it works as a full gamepad alternative as well.
Check out our roundup of thebest Switch accessories!
While battery life is good, it’s not quite as long as the normal Joy-Con (on account of its more sophisticated features). The Hyperion 2 lasts around 10 hours without RGB lighting and about five hours with RGB lighting on. That’s plenty of juice to use wirelessly, but these are meant to be used in the Switch’s handheld form so that wasn’t a major factor for me. Charging is done by being attached to the Switch itself, and the design doesn’t interfere with the console being docked. However, the Hyperion 2 does consume a bit more battery from your system. It wasn’t a noticeable difference, although it’s worth noting – I’m not exactly a stickler for squeezing every minute of battery life from my Switch, so it didn’t concern me all that much.
The NYXI Hyperion 2 is available for $79.99 (the same price as the regular Joy-Con) directly fromthe NYXI website.
I wish the NYXI Hyperion 2 came around much sooner, because it’s the best aftermarket Joy-Con set I’ve used throughout the Nintendo Switch’s lifecycle. Its clicky mouse-like buttons are responsive and easy on the fingers, the grips fill up my hands comfortably without being hefty, and the Hall Effect analog sticks blow the Joy-Con sticks out of the water. The back buttons are super convenient, and the simple Turbo function came in handy in some rare instances. If it came with an attachable grip for better use as a gamepad alternative and had an easier way to map the back buttons, this would be an even better package. First-party Nintendo accessories tend to come at a premium, so relative to the competition and its high quality, the NYXI Hyperion 2 is reasonably priced at $79.99 (which is the same as a new pair of regular Joy-Con). Is it too late to pick up given that the Switch 2’s Joy-Con sport an entirely new design? Maybe. But if you’re still in the market for a new Switch controller, the Hyperion 2 is a smart choice."
"Atomfalllooks like a hit, with 1.5 million players reached and, ahem, 300,000 cups of tea drank.

Rebellion’s brand new IP set in the north of England is the company’s most successful launch in its 32-year history, it said. Rebellion is the developer behind the popular Sniper Elite series of games, as well as the spin-off Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army entries.
Here's the official blurb:
“We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall,” said Jason Kingsley CBE, CEO and co-founder of Rebellion.
“To have surpassed the 1 million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off.
“We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series.
“We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game.”
While Atomfall launched simultaneously across PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series X and S and Xbox One,it also released on Game Pass as a day-one title, which will have significantly boosted player numbers.
Rebellion did not say how many copies of the game were sold, however, preferring, like Assassin’s Creed Shadows maker Ubisoft, to go down the player number route. But it did provide some fun stats to back up it announcement.
Over 316,000 Atomfall players, for example, have killed the scientist at the very beginning of the game. In total there have been over 3.7 million kills using the cricket bat, while over 4 million pasties and 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed.
IGN'sAtomfall reviewreturned an 8/10. We said: ""Atomfall is a compelling, post-apocalyptic survival story that satisfyingly bends to your choices and discoveries no matter which direction you take.""

"Samsung came in strong with today’s deals, and I have to admit, I’m eyeing a couple of them up.The 49-inch Odyssey G9 gaming monitorlooks like something pulled straight from a sci-fi movie.The Galaxy Tab S10+ 5Gis basically a laptop in disguise, and theGalaxy Z Flip 6is making flip phones cool again. If that’s not enough, theS24 Ultrais here to remind every other smartphone who’s boss, and theSSD dealsare giving me a solid excuse to finally clean up my storage situation.

Some of these discounts are impressive, like$500 off that insane QD-OLED monitor. Others, like theSonic statueandRimWorld deal, are more like little bonus treats for the fans. Either way, if you’ve been waiting for a solid sale on a gaming monitor, a high-end phone, or a storage upgrade, Samsung has something worth looking at today.
AliExpress has brand new PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch OLED consoles on sale for prices you won't find anywhere else. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming console that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by youraccount, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item.
I want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.
This phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.
I didn’t know I needed an 11-inch Sonic statue until now. The detail is impressive, the LED lights make it pop, and it’s half off. If you’re a Sonic fan, this is an easy yes. If you’re not, well, now’s a great time to start.
I can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.
RimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.
This SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.
I never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.
I think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.
Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.
Beats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.

It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.
Still using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.
These aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.
These Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.
Luxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.
This isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.
For those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says ""powerful Pokémon"" like an angry robot penguin).
I'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.
If somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.
Your PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).
If you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, ""I really need to delete some games,"" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.
Logitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.
Samsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype.

"Rockstar’s new and improved version ofGrand Theft Auto 5isn’t going down well on Steam following its launch earlier in March.

Grand Theft Auto 5 Enhanced, which released on March 4, has a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, with 54% of the 19,772 user reviews flagged as positive.
To put that into context, the original GTA 5 on Steam, now unlisted at the request of Rockstar Games and as a result unable to appear in search on Valve's platform, has a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam.
In fact, GTA 5 Enhanced is currently the worst user-reviewed GTA on Steam, with its closest competitor for the unwanted crown,Grand Theft Auto III – The Definitive Edition, on 66% positive reviews.
GTA 5 Enhanced is a free upgrade for GTA 5 on PC that includes sought-after features previously only available in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S versions ofGTA Online— including all the latest vehicles and performance upgrades available at Hao’s Special Works, animal encounters, and access to purchase a GTA+ Membership — along with improved graphics options and faster loading times. All players who currently own GTA 5 on PC can upgrade to this new version for free, with the ability to migrate your Story Mode and Online progress.
You’d think that would be a relatively straightforward process, but it appears the account migration isn’t working as intended for many players. Indeed, account migration problems are at the heart of most of the negative reviews flagged as ‘most helpful.’
“ ‘The GTA Online profile associated with this Rockstar Games account is not eligible for migration at this time,’ ” reported one disgruntled player. “If you think I'm throwing away nearly 700 hours of gameplay on one character so that you can make a few more bucks off me, then you can lick my anal orifice clean.
“This is an objective downgrade from the ‘old’ version. Gonna pretend this was never released and continue to enjoy Legacy version until the new game comes out when I'm 60.”
“I'm leaving a negative review mainly due to Rockstar deciding that some accounts should arbitrarily not be able to migrate, and if you ask for help from support, they just say they can't do anything about it,” reads another.
""I can't migrate either of my two accounts,"" another negative review reads. ""R* support is completely useless and can't help. With the game being over 10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years old I am sure as hell not going to completely restart all my progress in Online just to get marginally better graphics (if that) and HSW and whatever other minuscule ♥♥♥♥ they added.""
Despite these issues, GTA 5 Enhanced remains one of the most-played games on Steam, with a 187,059 peak concurrent player count since launch. But it has sparked concern over the inevitable PC release ofGrand Theft Auto 6, with some PC gamers worrying that Rockstar's struggles with GTA 5 Enhanced could signal launch trouble down the line.
GTA 6 is planned for launch during the fall of 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only, leaving PC gamers out in the cold. In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstarattempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hitsconsole, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.
We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including Take-Two boss StraussZelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out. Meanwhile,Take-Two has sued online marketplace PlayerAuctions, alleging it contains ""thousands of listings for unauthorized, infringing GTA 5 content – including heavily modified player accounts, in-game assets, and virtual currency – all gained by using hacking software, cheats, and technical exploits.""
And in other news,Rockstar recently acquiredGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Editiondeveloper Video Games Deluxeand renamed it Rockstar Australia.

"It's the day before theNintendo Switch 2 Direct, with less than 24 hours to go until Nintendo reveals its plans for its next console. A new Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filing could, potentially, point to some of those plans, at least when it comes to its Switch 2 controller lineup.

As spotted onFamiboardsand picked up by Nintendo-centric sites likeGoNintendo, an FCC filing emerged yesterday, March 31, from Nintendo. Under product code ""BEE-008,"" it looks to be a registration for a new game controller. Some fans believe this to be the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.
It bears mentioning that this is speculaton, as Nintendo hasn't confirmed plans for a Switch 2 Pro Controller yet. However, a few features do seem to indicate this would be a Pro Controller, like Bluetooth and NFC capability.
The big thing to note about this filing, if this is the Switch 2 Pro Controller, is that it could include a headphone jack. The original Switch 1 Pro Controller didn't have a headphone jack of any kind, while controllers like the DualSense and Xbox Series controllers do feature a port.
This would be a nice quality-of-life feature, if this holds true for the Switch 2 Pro Controller.Past Nintendo filingshave given us a glimpse of the company's plans in advance, so there's some reason to entertain speculation about this controller. We've yet to see it though, so barring any more leaks between now and tomorrow, we'll likely have confirmation once Nintendo announces its full plans for the Switch 2.
The Switch 2 Directairs tomorrow at 6am PT / 9am ET on Nintendo's channels. We'll be getting a ""closer look"" at the Switch 2, after its initial reveal earlier this year, and hopefully a lot of solid information leading up to a potential release date.
Nintendo has confirmed the Switch 2 Direct will run for an hour. Two Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2 presentations with hands-on gameplay have been scheduled for April 3 and April 4 as well, starting at 7am PT each day.

"A Minecraft Movieis now in theaters, and it turns out the team behind the film built their own Minecraft private server that was accessible to the whole cast and crew in order to make the movie as authentic as possible. In fact, Jack Black himself set out to prove he was a ""real Minecrafter"" and built a massive mansion on top of the highest mountain -- with an art gallery.

Having Minecraft so readily available was a huge help for the filmmakers when creating A Minecraft Movie, and producer Torfi Frans Ólafsson told IGN it fostered a feeling of ""being in an indie game studio, where things are jamming and ideas are floating around everywhere."" While they couldn't utilize every idea that came out of that as the ""train was already moving,"" it did give them a chance to ""add a little pizzazz"" on top of the film and make it feel true to the game.
A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess added that Black, who plays Steve in the film, was all the way in on playing Minecraft and proving he could stand toe-to-toe with the best.
""It was so much fun,"" Hess said. ""Jack was super-weirdly method with the game. He was in his trailer harvestinglapis lazuliand always building stuff. [He] was geeking out on the game and would come back with ideas. It was a constantly evolving thing where everybody was contributing in their own fun, unique way.""
""I had an Xbox in my trailer and I did play becausean actor prepares,"" Jack Black added with a grin. ""So I got as many hours as I could on this Minecraft server, which had tons of props from all the different departments.
""The cast and crew on the server were building some insane structures and I wanted to stand out. I wanted everyone to know that I wasa real Minecrafter,so I said I was going to find the biggest, highest mountain in this world and build a stairway to Steve and a mansion up on top of that hill. I had a basement in there with an art gallery and... I don't even know if it's still there!""
""It's up!"" Ólafsson confirmed. ""I kept it up and I extended it for a year. I popped up in there a couple days ago and I said, 'Wait, there's somebody online!' I went in, and there were these two security guards who worked the gate on set and and they're like, 'Hey, welcome!' I said, ""You guys are still in here?' and they said, ""Oh, yeah!""
While it remains to be seen if we'll ever see Jack Black's 'Real Minecrafter' Mansion, it's always a joy to hear what goes into making a movie and how these filmmakers brought the beloved game to life.

"Gaming fans are feeling the heat after Nintendo announced itsSwitch 2 U.S. pre-order date was delayedas a direct result of the newly announced tariffs posed by the Trump Administration.

Wednesday morning, Nintendo fully unveiled its hybrid console sequel alongside plans to open pre-orders come April 9 — news thatDonald Trump would soon implement sweeping tariffs across the globearrived just hours later. It was a moment of whiplash that the industry is still struggling to come to grips with, and now, two days later, the average gaming fan is already feeling the impact.
“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,” Nintendo said in a statement shared with IGN. “Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”
I really hate being right. I kept telling folks that things can literally change tomorrow. People kept yelling at me that the tariffs won't affect us...aight man 😒
46% tariff on Vietnamese imports announced now.Nintendo Switch 2 are produced there…It’s so fucking over.pic.twitter.com/5N1iAMI2Jm
they’re gonna make it even more expensivepic.twitter.com/5Y8FL9FZF6
“Wait a minute… are you sayingwehave to pay the tariffs??” oneReddit user commented. “Who could have possibly foreseen this?!”
While pre-order timing for other territories, including the UK, remains unchanged, Nintendo didn’t mince words when it came to how tariffs will affect those in the United States. However, changes to a release schedule, even when it comes to something as simple as pre-order timing, signal that Nintendo has more on its mind than it has revealed thus far.
There were fears that Nintendo’s proposed $450 Switch 2 price and$80 gamesmight be too big of an ask pre-tariffs — amovement aiming to get Nintendo to lower its price plansalready began shortly after that initial reveal — but the struggle for affordable games is just getting started. While someanalysts had suggestedSwitch 2 prices were calculated with potential tariffs in mind, Nintendo’s announcement today suggests those numbers have room to increase.
So thenThose WERE the pre tariff pricesYeah the Switch and Mario Kart bout to be 650 after taxes

Nintendo hasn’t announced when or if its Switch 2 prices will change, but there is plenty of reason to worry they will shift in a more expensive direction. What began as a wave of frustration aimed at the current Switch 2 price has now evolved into an ocean of people who, of course, are still angry, but now they are just hoping they’ll be able to afford the new console.
“This unironically frustrates me so much,” anotherReddit user added. “The switch 2 was already going to be quite expensive (compared to the OG) but I was still okay with paying the extra money for it. The games were another blow. Was too expensive already but whatever. But this? Huge tariffsPlus Sales taxPlus tariffs on the games???
“I don’t want to pay 130$ for a damn copy of a game or 600$ for the new Switch. I genuinely (think) this will impact the amount of people able to buy into all of this. I shouldn’t as an average person be priced out of this, yet I probably will be. Augh…”
I feel bad for all my US followers. If you thought the Switch 2 price was expensive before. It looks like its going to get even worse due to new tariffs.
We'vespoken to other industry analystswho acknowledge that these unprecedented tariffs have gamers and game-makers walking into uncharted territory and that there's no telling what exactly will happen with the Switch 2. While some believe we could soon see a price increase, others aren't so sure, but all agree that the industry will no doubt feel the impact of the Trump Administration's wide-reaching tariff plans.
The Switch 2 is Nintendo’s latest groundbreaking console, but a suddenly increased price could be just the start of what’s to come. Wespoke with Entertainment Software Association (ESA) spokesperson Aubrey Quinn to learn more about how Trump’s unprecedented tariffs will impact video game fans moving forward. As many have already feared, the ESA says there’s no reason to believe the damage will stop at Nintendo.

"Netflix's President of Games, Alain Tascan, is expecting a future generation that relies less on gaming consoles as major players like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo push forward with new hardware.

The lead of the streaming giant’s video game division shared his thoughts on how gaming fans might soon play their favorite titles during an interview withThe Game Businessthat took place following a Netflix presentation in San Francisco. During the event itself, Tascan was asked if the streamer had any intention of taking a crack at console gaming, but he’s not so sure younger gamers are even interested in what something like a PlayStation 6 could bring to the table.
“[When it comes to] console, we started to look at the future where the platform is agnostic,” he explained. “Look at the younger generation. Are eight year-olds and 10 year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6? I am not sure. They are wanting to interact with any digital screen, whatever it is, wherever it is, even in the car. With console you’re thinking about high definition, you’re thinking about the controller […] If we look at this older model, I think it will restrain us.”
Tascan told The Game Business that he’s got a soft spot for console gaming despite his concerns, specifically calling out Nintendo’s Wii as a personal favorite. He’s spent many years at studios such as EA, Ubisoft, and Epic Games in the past, so the idea of more traditional console game releases is far from foreign for him. For Netflix, though, things are trending in a different direction.
While the company has a proven track record for creating game adaptations for its IPs with subscription add-ons like Stranger Things 3: The Game, Too Hot to Handle: Love Is a Game, and more, it’s also experimented with giving users access to notable, familiar games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition. Each game can be played straight from a mobile phone if a subscriber chooses, and as Tascan clarified during that recent event, Netflix will be doubling down on this strategy as it develops party games and establishes itself as a hub for kids and gamer families.
“I am very vigorous about lowering friction and eliminating it if we can,” he told The Game Business. “I see that the subscription is friction as well. Maybe good friction because it makes business sense, but still we did the test of eliminating subscription for [mobile game] Squid Game: Unleashed. And we may do other tests.”
He continued: “But the other friction is having enough controllers for family. Having a piece of hardware that might be expensive, that’s another friction. Waiting for a game to download, that’s another friction. I am [looking at] all the obstacles, and asking if we can reduce them as much as possible.”
Netflix said in early 2024 that games engagement had tripled throughout 2023, signaling that it would continue investing in the space in the future after a 2021CNBCreport suggestedless than 1% of subscribers were tapping into its gamesofferings. In October 2024, the streaming giant cut back on its gaming ambitions when itshut down its AAA studio headed by former Overwatch, Halo, and God of War developers. AGame Developerreport from last month said cuts had also recently hit Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, a teamNetflix picked up in 2021.
As Netflix seeks to tap into a market that it expects to be uninterested in game consoles, there’s little reason to doubt we’ll see something like aPlayStation 6ornext Xboxfrom Sony and Microsoft, respectively. Nintendo, meanwhile, is teetering on the edge of a brand-new console generation with itshighly anticipated Switch 2 device. It will pull back the curtain on its new tech with a focused Direct presentation next week, with many fans expecting to hear more aboutwhat features the Switch 2 brings to the table, its release date, andhow pre-orders are being handled.

"Path of Exile 2developer Grinding Gear Games has fully detailed the first major content update since the action RPG’s early access launch last year.

Dawn of the Hunt goes live at 9pm CET on April 4, and adds the new Huntress class. The Huntress is a Spear and Buckler user specialising in hybrid melee and ranged combat. Elsewhere, there are five new ascension classes: the Ritualist, Amazon, Smith of Kitava, Tactician, and Lich.
Players can also expect dozens of new encounters in the endgame, significant mechanical overhauls, over one hundred new unique items as well as significantly expanded crafting options.
The long wait for the Path of Exile 2 early access launch finally came to an end when it released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on December 6, 2024. It saw massive success,securing its place as the 15th most-played game Steam game ever.
But the game ran into issues, both technical and in design. GGG has worked to update the game in the months since, culminating in next month's Dawn of the Hunt release.
At the same time, GGG continues to operate the first Path of Exile game, which still enjoys a healthy playerbase on Steam, as a live service. But this has proved challenging. In January,GGG was forced to apologize to fans of the first gameafter putting a new update on hold until a crucial update for Path of Exile 2 was released.
Meanwhile,Path of Exile 2 has found itself embroiled in an online disputethat revolves around X / Twitter owner Elon Musk’s admission that he paid someone to boost his account. When contacted by IGN, Grinding Gear Games declined to comment.
Obliterate your enemies with the hybrid ranged and melee Huntress
Step into the bloodstained boots of the Huntress, a dexterous and ferocious spear-wielding warrior. Banished from her homeland, she now stalks her prey using both ranged spear throws and close combat attacks. Her brutal arsenal is designed to make combat feel like a relentless pursuit, always in motion, moving into and out of melee range at a moments notice.
The Huntress can also Parry incoming attacks from monsters, stunning them before following up with one of several counterattacks. For example, use Disengage after a Parry to quickly jump back, gaining a Frenzy charge, then follow up with an empowered spear throw.
Stalk your prey with an array of elemental spear attacks that empower the Huntress to use some of the longest combo chains we have created on any class.
Create mayhem with five new ascendancy classesWith five new Ascendancy Classes, Dawn of the Hunt introduces fresh new ways to expand your build options.
Sharpen your arsenal with new skill and support gemsAs well as20 New Spear Skillsdesigned for the huntress, we have two other much anticipated abilities.
This expansion also brings a massive overhaul to character development by addingover 100 new Support Gemsto enhance build diversity. Support gems add a variety of interesting effects to your existing skills, modifying them in game changing ways.
For example, Haemocrystals turn bleed effects into explosive Vaal crystals, and Caltrops allow your existing skills to litter the battlefield with slowing hazards.
Unlock greater potential with Over 100 new Unique ItemsDawn of the Hunt brings a stronger focus on Mid and Endgame Unique items, ensuring high-level characters have more thrilling bounty to chase.
Unbridled power awaits with new crafting toolsNew crafting tools have been introduced as rewards across many areas of the game:
Darkness lurks aheadThe Azmeri Spirit has made itself present in Wraeclast. When approached, these wisps will flee, and monsters it comes into contact with will be infused by it, making them more powerful. Wisps will also find and possess Rare or Unique monsters, granting them powerful new abilities, and powerful new rewards. There are twelve distinct types of wisp, each with their own mechanics and rewards.
New MapsDawn of the Hunt adds eight new Maps offering fresh challenges and rewards. Each of them come with interesting new encounters.
Be forced to fight mirrored Rare monsters in a shifting, warped reality inThe Fractured Lake, or be thrust into the wild Ezomyte Forests ofThe Phaaryl Megalithswhere rune-carved stones surge with energy.  Survive the storm-fueled gauntlet of deadly boss waves, and you’ll earn full boss rewards and exclusive Runes
Unique Strongboxes
Find four new Unique Strongboxes, each with deadly mechanics and valuable rewards.
Corrupted Essences
Essences receive major upgrades, with four new Corrupted Essences -Hysteria, Delirium, Horror, and Insanity- offering new combat mechanics and powerful new crafting outcomes, such as guaranteed double Enchantments when using a Vaal Orb on belts.
Cleanse the CorruptionCorruption has continued to spread throughout Wraeclast and has formed into larger and larger zones. In the centre of each one lies a Corrupted Nexus, the home of three new terrifying bosses, amalgamations of Corruption itself.
Upon defeating these bosses, any remaining areas within the zone of Corruption will become cleansed. Cleansed Maps have additional new monsters, a new boss and their own set of Modifiers and rewards.
Duel with Rogue ExilesOn your travels you will sometimes encounter Rogue Exiles - others like you who have been exiled and are openly hostile. They will challenge you - a fight to the death. These Exiles have capabilities to Dodge Roll, avoid your abilities with smart pathfinding, smart-targeting, and much more action-packed gameplay. Rogue Exiles use the same skills available to players, and even the same items. They aren't just dressed up in those items, they know how to take advantage of the Uniques they are using.
Of course, if you are able to slay these Exiles, those items will all drop on the ground!
Dynamic improvements to endgameDawn of the Hunt significantly rebalances the endgame. The number of towers has been drastically reduced but they have been made much more powerful. Tablets now affect twice as many areas and running higher tier Maps in Towers increases this number further still. In addition, each Tower will be able to consume up to three Tablets at once.
These changes significantly reduce the amount of busy work required in endgame while improving your ability to use them. On top of that, Towers can now spawn with all mechanics, and have their own new Bosses!
Prepare for the HuntRise as a hunter, or fall as prey on April 4th. The Dawn of the Hunt content update will also be made available in existing Early Access leagues for those wishing to play their existing characters. It is recommended to start anew in a fresh economy to get the full, recommended experience in the Dawn of the Hunt leagues.

"Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2is getting a big update today. Patch 1.2 is out now, and alongside fixes and improvements, there's both a barber shop and Steam Workshop modding support added to the massive RPG.

The barber shop is the first of ""several"" planned free DLCs, per a press release from Warhorse, and will let protagonist Henry visit the barber to change up his hairstyle. There's also an option for either a clean-shaven or rugged appearance, as well as facial hair ranging from stubble to beard. A new haircut will, just like in real life, give Henry a temporary boost to charisma.
Patch 1.2 (massive patch notes below!) addresses over 1,000 fixes and improvements, including equipment and NPC behavior, as well as gameplay balance. Specifically, developer Warhorse Studios tackled country-specific localization as well. The new patch for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 refines the Chinese translations, both Traditional and Simplified, improves the Korean font for clarity, and has a newly recorded French voiceover.
As for modding, dedicated Steam modding support has arrived alongside the barber DLC and Patch 1.2. The toolkit allows players to tinker with over 300 elements in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, ranging from user interface and combat mechanics to AI behavior. ""Whether making subtle tweaks or complete overhauls, the possibilites for customization are vast,"" Warhorse said. The studio plans on discussing these updates further during a developer stream, set for March 20, 2025.
Additional content isexpected to roll out for the historical RPG throughout the year, with its first paid content drop ""Brushes with Death"" set for this summer. The Legacy of the Forge expansion is expected in autumn, and then this winter, Warhorse aims to release Mysteria Ecclesia, which involves a covert mission in the Sedlec Monastery.
The latest from Warhorse Studios doesn't show any sign of slowing down in sales, either. The sequelsold 2 million copies in less than two weeks, andEmbracer has hailed the game as a success. Inour own review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 at IGN, the RPG got high marks for its melee combat, story, and a ""truly dynamic"" open-world sandbox.

"No two rooms at Mt. Holly are the same — nor do they even stay in the same place
byJay Castello
The house at Mt. Holly has 45 rooms. But the placement of each of those rooms is up to you — and it resets every day. You’ve been left the house and its estate as an inheritance, but only if you can find the mysterious 46throom.
In this way,Blue Princeblends its puzzles with both deck-building and roguelite elements. When you open the entrance hall door at the start of every morning, you’ll be given a choice of three rooms that might lie beyond it. Each of them has a fixed number and orientation of doors, limiting your path through the house, and each room has its own small bonus — or, in some cases, a drawback.
You might, for instance, draw the bedroom, and get rewarded with 10 additional steps to use throughout the day. Or you might draw the weight room, and lose half of your carefully scrounged footsteps. (The game’s step counter is a limitation on your movement; you can’t walk forever through the house, and if you run out of steps, you’ll have to come back the next day and start from scratch.) Or you might draw the parlor and have to solve a truth-and-lie logic puzzle to get gems, which you can spend on drafting more useful rooms later. Or you might find the nook, which always has a key; keys become increasingly necessary as you progress, since doors become more likely to be locked.
And then, packed in everywhere and anywhere, there’s the intrigue. In one early run, I opened a chest to find the “Key to the Secret Garden,” which warned me that it would not be an easy room to locate. It wasn’t until much later that I got access to the orchard, which explained how and where I could get access to said garden. But then I had to wait to run into the key again. That wait could have been a drag, except that (at least in the game’s first 10 or so hours) I was juggling dozens of these small cause-and-effect bits of progress at once, so there was always something to make me feel like I was moving forward.
This gradual accumulation of knowledge is almost the whole ofBlue Prince(one early room recommends having a notebook at hand; I filled several pages), although there are some architectural elements of the house that become permanent, making future runs more likely to be fruitful. These moments tend to feel big, some of them even having very atmospheric cutscenes that break up the routine of drafting door after door. You’ll also be collecting passwords and codes that stay the same across runs. Mainly, every new draft is a question of what you will learn about the estate and how you will apply that knowledge in future runs.
Spending run after run in the house gives you a lot of time to appreciate just how finely it’s built. Every room has a different walking sound to reflect the kind of flooring it has, for example. There are moments when the creeping dread of being alone in a shape-shifting house suddenly cuts through, momentarily but completely changing the atmosphere. And there are dozens of architectural details and notes and bits of clutter that all go into building up an idea of the history that once went on between these old walls.
With so many details hidden in every room, though, it’s important to bear in mind that the house also holds many, many mysteries that go much beyond your inheritance. After a while, discoveries that didn’t lead to something useful for the specific goal of finding the 46th room sometimes started to feel like disappointments, until I rolled around to the other side and started to appreciate just how much more is going on in this mysterious mansion. Being open to these grander puzzles, and accepting that solving one big question is only a sliver of what the game has to offer, made it much less frustrating.
Having said that, that willingness to be open is sometimes difficult to maintain when you run into a string of bad luck. Unless you are enlightenment-levels of willing to accept everything the game has to throw at you, sometimes you really will want to do a few runs just looking for something specific, which is never guaranteed. And unfortunately, the first several minutes of every attempt do end up feeling very samey, as the game doesn’t usually start offering more interesting rooms until you’re some way into the house. Some rooms are also just straight-up annoying. There’s a math-based puzzle that I hated every time, and it becomes harder and harder as you do more and more runs — but it’s very punishing to skip it because it grants keys, which are extremely valuable.
Because of friction like this, I think thatBlue Princeis going to live on the strength of its community. There came a point where repeating runs was not getting me anywhere, and every time, I would dread having to spend 10 or so minutes going through the motions again before getting a chance of seeing something new. (Or at least, something new that was going to make me feel like I was actually progressing toward a goal that I was interested in.) It turned out that I had missed something I could interact with in a room that I had previously written off as useless, which I only found out by talking to other people who were playing. Figuring that out had me rolling credits within a couple of hours — and more importantly, those couple of hours completely recaptured the enthusiasm and sense of discovery I’d had in the early game.
Seeding those kinds of hints without spoilers isn’t easy, but I do expectBlue Princeto grow the kind of fan base that can pull it off. It’s good now, but that will make it even better.
Blue Princewill be released April 10 on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. The game was reviewed on PC using a prerelease download code provided by Raw Fury.

"They compete closely on price and specs, but Nintendo still owns the mass market
byOli Welsh
When Nintendo launched the Switch in 2017, it had no competition in dedicated handheld gaming, a sector it had established with the Game Boy in 1989 and ruled ever since. Sega had come and gone; Sony, after two determined attempts with the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita, had just about given up.
As Switch 2 nears launch in 2025, things look a little different — but only a little. The colossal success of the Switch has awoken the slumbering giants. Sony and Microsoft are now reportedly preparingdedicated PlayStationandXbox handhelds. Improbably, though, it was the PC gaming sphere that made the first move. Valve led the way with the Steam Deck in 2022, which swiftly seeded a growing ecosystem of similar, PC-based handheld devices from manufacturers like Lenovo and Asus. After a quiet decade, non-Nintendo handheld gaming is a thing again. And that means the Switch 2 will not run unopposed for handheld gaming supremacy.
In a sense, Nintendo is the victim of its own strategic foresight. With the Switch, it was the first to spot that the narrowing gap in processing power between mobile and at-home devices had enabled a unification of handheld and home gaming experiences. Finally, the same games could work in both contexts. The Switch proved this point emphatically, and now everyone wants a piece.
But with dedicated devices from Sony and Microsoft still years away, for now that competition must come from Steam Deck and the other PC handhelds. My colleague Chris Plante persuasively argued that these devices representNintendo’s “biggest threat in the present.”They trounce the Switch on specs and have closed the gap to contemporary AAA gaming in the home until it’s almost imperceptible. Software-wise, they offer the compelling value and staggering range of just about everything on Steam — and much of PC gaming beyond it, if you’re prepared to fiddle about a bit.
It’s true that the Switch 2’s price and specs put it into direct competition with the lower-end PC handhelds. At $449, it’s $50 more expensive than the base model Steam Deck. The Switch 2 isroughly comparable in power and storage, has a much better screen, and with detachable controllers and a TV dock included in the price, it’s much more flexible to use. The base model of Asus’ ROG Ally handheld ($499 or thereabouts) and the new Lenovo Legion Go S ($549) are also pretty close competitors in terms of specs.
In raw hardware terms, these are all very similar devices. It’s worth noting that the Switch 2’sexclusive accesstoNvidia’s market-leading DLSS upscaling technologyshould allow it to punch a bit above its weight class. But realistically, there’s not much between them.
But — and it’s a very, very big but — comparing the Switch 2 to the PC handhelds by running your finger down a spec sheet, or by noting that they can all playCivilization 7andElden Ring, does not tell the whole story. Within an enthusiast bubble, PC handhelds are a big deal, but they do not exist in the same universe as Nintendo consoles. To put it bluntly, PC handhelds are still niche.
The Steam Deck has been a big success for Valve, but let’s put it in perspective. Valve has not discussed sales numbers, but market research estimates thatit has sold around 4 million Steam Decks. And Steam Deck dwarfs its competition; the same research suggests that, in total, around 6 million PC handhelds have been sold in the three years since the Steam Deck went on the market. Worryingly, there aren’t yet signs of strong growth in sales.
Stack that up against the Switch’s 150 million units sold and the wild difference in scale becomes evident. Of course, it isn’t a directly analogous comparison. PC handhelds have only existed for three years; the Switch has been around for eight years, and Nintendo has been in the handhelds business for more than 35 years. All the same, Nintendo predicts it will sell11 million units of the aging Switchin its current fiscal year — more than five times the predicted sales of PC handhelds in that time. Meanwhile, analysts reckon that theSwitch 2 will, on its own, outstrip the size of the PC handheld marketalmost immediately, with 6 to 8 million units available at launch, and up to 20 million sales in its first year.
Valve is a big player in the game industry, and a very rich company. But it is a newcomer to the world of consumer electronics retail, and it has a lot of catching up to do — if it’s even interested in doing it. Steam Deck isn’t available to purchase in stores; you can’t walk into Walmart and pick one up. Valve is not buying ads for it on TV or at bus stops. Companies like Lenovo and Asus have more traditional distribution channels, but they’re tiny minnows compared to the marketing, retail, and distribution might of Nintendo.
There are other factors that make the PC handhelds niche products. The user experience of Windows-based handhelds like the ROG Ally and Legion Go is notoriously bad. Valve’s SteamOS is much better, but it is still quite far removed from the reliability and simplicity offered by Nintendo and the other console platforms.
You cannot unbox a new Steam Deck, turn it on, and play a game straight away. It requires tinkering to get the best out of. Although Valve’s verification system for games is a helpful guide, it’s not guaranteed you’ll get a good, playable experience on every game. The Deck is also bulky and heavy. You would never buy one for a child, or share one within a family — it’s clearly not designed to be shared. Realistically, it remains a tough sell for anyone who isn’t a gaming hobbyist.
There is, reportedly, one upcoming device that may be able to change this narrative a little. Microsoft is said to be working with a PC handheld manufacturer ona system that will have Xbox brandingand a user interface based on a new version of the Xbox PC app. This has the potential to be a more user-friendly device that offers easy access to PC Game Pass on the go, which would be quite compelling. But, although Microsoft has now been making Xbox consoles for over 20 years, it hasconsistently struggledto use that experience to make PC gaming more seamless, despite repeated attempts — and the device doesn’t sound like much more than a stopgap until Microsoft’s own dedicated handheld console is ready.
Nintendo will not have true competition in handhelds until its peers in the console space get involved. Microsoft is reportedly eyeing 2027 for the release of its handheld Xbox. Sony’s portable PS5 is also said to be years away, if it’s ever released. Things are definitely heating up for Nintendo, and by the end (or even the middle) of the Switch 2’s life, the handheld gaming market is sure to be much busier than it is now. But for the next few years, competition for the new console will remain distant — at best.

"Am I enabling the Disney villains in their modern evil schemes? Maybe, maybe so
byPetrana Radulovic
I did something horrible. I told Jafar, the scheming vizier villain in Disney’sAladdin, about cryptocurrency, and now he’s determined to get WyshCoin off the ground by selling the luxurious lifestyle associated with the brand. The problem is he’s actually broke, so I need to brew him teleportation potion after teleportation potion so he can sneak into increasingly extravagant venues in order to sell the illusion of the WyshCoin lifestyle.
That’s just a day in the life of a potionista (a portmanteau of potion maker and barista) at the Cursed Café, the coffee shop at the center ofDisney Villains Cursed Café. The game is a partnership between Disney Studios and indie team Bloom Digital Media. InDisney Villains Cursed Café, I spend time brewing potions, talking to my villainous clientele and helping them achieve their goals (or sometimes, very specificallynothelping them). It’s a modern setting, which means the villains all have fun, contemporary designs — and contemporary problems.
Yes, Jafar’s setting up a cryptocurrency, and Snow White’s Evil Queen is running her own pyramid scheme. Meanwhile, Gaston is trying to impress his new golf bros at the country club he just joined. It’s hilarious to see what sorts of villainous shenanigans these iconic characters get up to in a modern, low-stakes setting. They’re taking over the world… in their own ways. And hey, in the year 2025, that does mean having huge social media followings!
The writing is sharp and funny, with some particularly pointed dialogue options (you can tell the villains that in this modern world, the rulers are the 1%, for instance). Seeing the characters interact is also a highlight. Cruella and the Evil Queen roll their eyes at Gaston’s attempts at dating on “the apps.” Maleficent and Ursula reluctantly team up for a social media collaboration. And throughout it all, the art style is incredibly charming, an elevated rendering of the characters’ Disney movie counterparts with some painterly accents.
With each in-game day, I have three chances to serve customers. Most of the time, this means picking between two villains to serve. But don’t worry — if it’s Cruella and Jafar at the counter and I pick Jafar, the rest of Cruella’s storyline will still unfold. The brewing mechanic is pretty straightforward; I just look at the recipe list to find the requested potion and then select the ingredients in my cupboards.
Occasionally, the villains will have bigger requests, and taking those on will continue the next big chapters of their plots. They’ll present me with their desired potion, often something malevolent and more complicated. My handy potion book will suggest a “good” option as well: It’ll have the same outcome, but probably result in less property damage. If you want to try a different option — or if you accidentally add the wrong ingredients — you’ll have the choice at the end of the day to buy a re-do from Yzma. The branching is simple, but enjoyable.
There is also an overarching mystery about the previous owner of the café that continues to perplex me — and is surprisingly complicated to figure out. One time, after I had messed up a day and intended to redo it, Yzma handed me a key that unlocked a secret room that held clues about this mysterious owner. But since I had fumbled the Evil Queen’s storyline, I erased the memories of that day to try again. The second time, though, I didn’t get the key — and a few in-game days later, I still haven’t! I’m not sure what conditions trigger more information about this storyline, but I’m determined to keep selling potions to find out.
But even if I’m still struggling at figuring out the grander mystery of the Cursed Café, I’m invested in the storylines of my customers. Even if I’m notactuallyinvesting in WyshCoin, every time I see Jafar at the counter, I eagerly select him to serve because I just want to know what the heck he’s scheming next. Maybe I’m tapping into my own inner villain by enabling him, but hey, you don’t become the favorite potion brewer of some of the best Disney villains by playing hero.

"GameChat opens new doors for players, but the feature is haunted by the past and future

TheSwitch 2is a social machine. For the console’s second iteration, Nintendo prioritizedprocessing powercapable oflarge-scale multiplayer. TheJoy-Cons’ new C buttonlets you instantly join a group chat with shared-screen play options. Extensions in the Nintendo Switch Online app will add dimension to old titles, includingautobuild-sharing inThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. As producer Kouichi Kawamoto put it in Nintendo’s post-revealAsk the Developerupdate, development of the Switch 2 was inspired by memories of “playing games together as children at a friend’s house or in a student lounge, where everyone brought their own consoles.” The clear goal is to bring frictionless community play to Switch 2 that will be safe for all ages.
The pitch is harmonious on paper and, based on footage in theSwitch 2 Direct, existentially terrifying as a practice. Inspired by one of the defining experiences of the early 2020s, in which many of us were sequestered inside our homes playingAnimal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo has, intentionally or not, optimized Switch 2 for the next global shutdown.
Work on the Switch 2 began in earnest in 2019, according to Kawamoto, and the early focus was on improving software performance through tech upgrades. But development soon became entangled with the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdown protocols forced Nintendo’s teams, among millions and millions of others, to work from home. The frustrations the team experienced while making the setup work led to one of Switch 2’s major features: GameChat.
“Back then, we were using a video conferencing system to check the software we were developing with our team, but the screen-sharing function built into the video conferencing system only allowed us to share one gameplay screen at a time,” Kawamoto says in the Ask the Developer interview. “So, we had each person place their game screen in front of their camera instead of their faces. When we did that, it felt like we were all in the same place, each bringing our own console to play the game together, which was a lot of fun. Based on this experience, we proposed adding a feature to Switch 2 where people can share their gameplay screen with other players.”
As demonstrated in a video Nintendo released on Thursday, GameChat looks and feels exactly like a Discord or Zoom call. After receiving a notification for a GameChat invite from a friend, a player simply hits the C button to open a multi-window grid that allows for the seamless continuation of play while peeking in on whatever their friends are playing and chatting back and forth. The sizzle reel shows up to four people participating in a call, playing games individually or together in multiplayer spaces likeSplatoon 3andMario Party Jamboree. Players speak to each other using the onboard console mic and can activate video usingthe new Switch 2 camera accessory. If for some reason a Switch 2 player needed to remain in their house without making human contact for two to 12 months, Nintendo has them covered on the socializing front.
In many ways, Nintendo is beyond late to the game. Discord is right there, but even before the ubiquitous social platform, Microsoft strove for a similar connection when it launched Skype integration for the Xbox One in 2013, allowing for a party-chat-like experience. Nintendo’s dream of bringing distant friends closer together during remote play also predates GameChat; the Wii had the Wii Speak mic accessory and thefew people who bought a Wii Uhad the ability to ring friends with Wii U Chat. But GameChat stands to be the cleanest collision of social and play on a console yet, and one with greater protection for kids thanks to Nintendo’s walled-off friend-list gardens. In the Switch 2 era, no distance will keep friends apart.
It’s a far cry from the vision for the original Switch. Nintendo revealed that console ina vibrant 2016 teaserthat highlighted the hybrid console’s on-the-go possibilities. Players could kick back on the couch to play the new Zelda, or they could also traverse Hyruleliterally anywhere else— in airports, in parks, huddled around a beer hall picnic table with friends. Those memories of “playing games together as children” were part of the Switch DNA too, with an emphasis on breaking down the living room walls. With the Switch 2, Nintendo has retreated back indoors, and wants us to lean in closer to the TV.
Nintendo hasn’t abandoned the hybrid nature of the console and it never will, but GameChat’s Zoom aesthetic is a jarring departure from the limitlessness of the 2016 Switch reveal. In Nintendo’s promo video for Switch 2, good-looking 20-somethings chill in each of their loft apartments, remotely chit-chatting with each other as one playsZelda: Echoes of Wisdomand another explains the inner workings ofUntitled Goose Game. In another vignette, a Japanese woman tells her three friends about a pizza place they once visited together in the outside world, which she has recreated inAnimal Crossing: New Horizons, a game which has no negative connotations to our social reality whatsoever.
Read the news, and you know Nintendo is making a smart call. Ashas been widely reported over the last year, the outbreak potential of H5N1, dubbed “bird flu,” looms as the virus jumps from avian species to mammals. The fear at this present juncture is not just that H5N1 couldevolve to affect a wider spread of humansthan just poultry and dairy workerswho contract it on farms, but that combating bird flu is looking more and more like a potential U.S. infrastructure failure. Scientists say bird fluhas been under-addressed on a political levelover the last few years, while the Trump administration’s mission tocut jobs in the health sectormay impact the meager work that is being done. When asked recently what should be done about the continued emergence of bird flu, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s top health official, suggestedletting it run its course through bird populations, which scientists seem to agree is a pretty terrible way of mitigating viral mutation.
That’s a lot of doom to erupt out of the introduction of Nintendo’s GameChat function, but then again, who could forget the time when GameChat would make the most sense? During my quarantine days in 2020, I spent an ungodly number of evenings playingMario Kart 8 Deluxeonline with a few non-gamer friends who lived just a few blocks away. Like the majority of people, the easiest way for us all to catch up face to face and talk a bit of smack as we swerved around Rainbow Road was to load up the Switch on the TV and a Zoom call on a laptop. With Switch 2, we’ll have GameChat. In a way, I pray we never have to use it.
There are less apocalyptic reasons GameChat is a tremendous advancement. There are families spread out around the state, the country, the world, who will come together to playKirby Air Ridersand feel closer than they ever would over a quick FaceTime check-in. The FromSoftware fans will have a helluva time screaming at each other asthey embark on whateverThe Duskbloodsturns out to be. All of that will happen from the comfort of home — the same home, the same walls, the same sofa, the inescapable familiar.
The global population might completely avoid H5N1 or whatever the next close call looks like. Nintendo isn’t taking a chance. It has built a console for socializing in solitary confinement that, thankfully, still has a handheld mode. I’ll be taking it outside while I can.

"This week is pure action and pure puzzle
byTyler Colp
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
The new game releases this week give you two choices: puzzles or action. There’s really no in between. Action fans get to fight monsters with magical powers inSouth of Midnightor take on intense multiplayer heists inMonaco 2. Puzzle fans get to explore an ever-changing mansion inBlue Princeor take the time to unravel the mysteries ofThe Talos Principle: Reawakened.
It’ll be a tough decision if you like both genres, because most of these games drop on the same day, but a few of them are less traditional than others.Star Overdrivesticks out in the action category as a game with monsters to fight but also hoverboard tricks to pull off. AndJumping Jazz Catsis a game where the action consists of an army of cats racing to complete minigames.
Here are our most anticipated game releases for the week of April 7.
Release date:April 8Platforms:Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis action game is steeped in folklore and set in the American Deep South. The world is infested with gruesome monsters that seem to be pain and trauma made manifest. Your job as Hazel, a magic-wielding Weaver, is to mend your community and hopefully find a place to call home yourself.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis pitch for this puzzle game is like nightmare mode for anyone in fear of getting stumped. It’s set in a mansion where the rooms and their puzzles change as each day passes. The goal is to find Room 46, but you’ll need to be extremely clever to keep up with the constantly shifting obstacles.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThey put the philosophical puzzle game into Unreal Engine 5. This updated version has all kinds of new stuff, including a new chapter in the story, quality-of-life improvements, and a tool to make puzzles yourself.
Release date:April 10Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis co-op heist game requires teamwork and clever thinking. You get to play as unique characters with tools to overcome the various security measures and guards in your way. Each level is procedurally generated, too, so every run will be slightly different.
Release date:April 10Platforms:Nintendo SwitchTony Hawk’s Pro SkatermeetsNo Man’s Skyin this hoverboard action game. You get to ride around on alien planets, solve puzzles, and pull off tricks. And as if this game didn’t sound cool enough, you also fight enemies with a keytar.
Release date:April 10Platforms:Windows PCI’m not going to lie to you: I mostly chose this game simply because it’s calledJumping Jazz Cats. But it also looks pretty fun. You and up to eight other players get to run around and play minigames as little cats. Well, they’re called “minigames,” but they look more like a bunch of excuses to absolutely wreck the house of your absent owners.

"Achievements? Never heard of ‘em
byTyler Colp
TheSwitch 2won’t be joining the Xbox and PlayStation consoles with its own system-wide achievements, Nintendo confirmed to Polygon in a recent interview.
When we asked vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen if we can expect achievements, he gave a pretty clear answer: “Nope.”
Just like on Switch 1, it’ll be up to game developers to implement them in their own way. Ubisoft games, for example, have their own achievement system tied to Ubisoft Connect. When you earn them, they won’t show up on your Nintendo profile. And that’s not going to change with Switch 2.
But even though a traditional achievement system won’t exist, Nintendo is still experimenting with someachievement-like systemsin theSwitch 2 versions ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom. Both games will let you earn medals on the Nintendo Switch phone app. When you do things like travel long distances or collect a large number of rupees, those will be tracked inside the Zelda Notes part of the app, and you’ll be able to see how you compare against other players around the world.
That’s about as close as you’re going to get to achievements on Switch 2. Nintendo isn’t going to reward you for finishing first place as the cow inMario Kart World; that’ll be on you to celebrate when theSwitch 2 releases in June.

"﻿It turns out they’re hiding in plain sight
byOli Welsh
During anhourlong presentation on Wednesday, Nintendo bombarded prospective Switch 2 buyers with information about the new console and its games, including a torrent of ports from third-party publishers. But, once the dust had settled, it was easy to succumb to a creeping anxiety. Where were all the first-party launch titles from Nintendo itself?Mario Kart Worldlooks great, but isit $79.99 great?
Yes and no. Depending on how you define a launch game — and how you define a Switch 2 game — the Switch 2 will launch with anywhere between one and nine Nintendo games. You don’t have to expand these definitions to the absolute limit to realize that the Switch 2 is launching with relatively strong first-party support compared to Nintendo’s past systems. But it is true that Nintendo is approaching this launch a little differently.
First, a little historical perspective: In the last 20 years or so, new Nintendo consoles have launched with only two or three first-party games. For example, the Switch hadThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,1-2-Switch, andSnipperclips, a small eShop game. Further back, the Wii had the admittedly killerZelda: Twilight PrincessandWii Sportsdouble-header; the DS the more dubious pairing ofSuper Mario 64 DSandMetroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt.
In terms of Nintendo-made exclusive games, the Switch 2 has two titles on day one:Mario Kart WorldandNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour. But the latter is a download-only virtual guide to the hardware that most people wouldn’t consider a full launch title. So yes, compared to previous systems, it looks a little light.
But considerDonkey Kong Bananza, which is set for release on July 17 — just six weeks after the launch of the console. This is clearly a major new Nintendo platformer, and given what we know about Nintendo’s conservative approach to finishing games and setting launch dates, it seems likely the game would be ready to hit the June 5 launch day if Nintendo wanted it to. (It could well be finished already.)
It’s probable that Nintendo shiftedBananza’s launch date back as a deliberate marketing strategy, perhaps to extend the hype window beyond launch, perhaps to cover a second wave of stock. Or perhaps out of concern thatMario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananzamight cannibalize each other if launched together, because they’re both major titles. This is a key point. If we considerBananzaa launch title, and I think it’s only right to, then the Switch 2 is launching with two brand-new, exclusive Nintendo games of the highest order — which is arguably a first.
First-party support for Switch 2 goes even further when you considerSwitch 2 Editionsof existing Switch games. The system launches withenhanced versionsofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom, followed quickly in July bySuper Mario Party Jamboree, which has received a pretty extensive update tailored to the console’s GameChat features and camera. In August, Nintendo will release an expanded version ofKirby and the Forgotten Landwith a whole new storyline. Some of these upgrades, especially the Mario Party and Kirby releases, seem substantial enough to be compared to the Deluxe Switch versions of Wii U games likeMario Kart 8andNew Super Mario Bros. U.
(You can only get to nine first-party launch games by including the threeGameCube reissues, exclusive to Switch 2, on Nintendo Switch Online:The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Soulcalibur 2, andF-Zero GX. This is pushing it, I admit, although I would bet these will be some of my most-played games in my first weeks with the new console.)
Through the rest of 2025, we’ll getDrag x Drive,Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,Kirby Air Riders, and Switch 2 Editions ofMetroid Prime 4: BeyondandPokémon Legends: Z-A. All in all, across Switch 2 exclusives and Switch 2 Editions, Nintendo announced 12 titles coming in 2025 during Wednesday’s Direct.
That’s a lot of games by any measure. (Certainly compared to the first-party support given to Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 in their first nine months on the market.) It just looks different, partly because Nintendo is choosing to spread out its release dates, and partly because Switch 2 Editions are a more diffuse concept than the ports and remasters that have been Nintendo’s stock-in-trade on previous consoles. Nintendo is certainly hedging its bets a little with two of its biggest 2025 games,Metroid Prime 4: BeyondandPokémon Legends: Z-A, also coming to the Switch. But however you cut it, Switch 2 first-party support is a lot stronger than it might have seemed at first.

"﻿It hasn’t gone well for Sony. But Nintendo’s strategy is a bit different
byOli Welsh
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
During Wednesday’sSwitch 2 Direct, Nintendo revealed that some games for the original Switch could be upgraded to enhancedSwitch 2 Editionsby purchasing an upgrade pack. This isn’t surprising, coming from a company that has long loved to repackage old games for new consoles and sell them to fans a second (or third, or fourth) time. But it left some observers feeling that Nintendo was nickel-and-diming its fans — and it’s a strategy that comes with risks.
When launching a console that’sfully backward-compatible with its predecessor’s games, console makers have some tricky choices to make. One of the trickiest involves how to handle pricing and upgrades when there are versions of the same game for both platforms — particularly if the platform holder is increasing the price of games on the new system (as Nintendo is).
Both Sony and Microsoft were faced with this conundrum when they launched their most recent consoles, and they made very different choices. Microsoft’s policy is both generous and simple: Any Xbox One games are upgraded to Xbox Series X editions automatically and at no extra cost. If you own the newer console, you can rest easy that you are always playing the best version of the game without thinking about it, and without shelling out for it.
Sony’s policy is a bit less generous, and much more confusing. Some upgrades from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5 versions of games are free. (Quite a few, to be fair.) Many are not; it costs $10 to upgrade a copy ofMarvel’s Spider-ManorGrand Theft Auto 5to the PS5 version, for example. Sometimes this upgrade path was only available for a limited time. Sometimes it’s not available at all, and your only option, if you already own the game on PS4, is to buy it all over again on PS5.
Understandably, this messy, costly system didn’t go down well with PlayStation players. WhenHorizon Forbidden Westwas announced with no upgrade path, fans were so upset that Sony was forced to back down,offer a free upgrade, and pledge to always offer upgrades in the future (albeit for a price). This is the minefield that Nintendo is now stepping into.
There are a few caveats, however. Firstly, Nintendo did not announce pricing for its upgrade packs, and how players feel about the upgrades will depend to a large extent on where this pricing lands. Also, will the upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which improves performance and comes with somecompanion-app features, cost the same as theSwitch 2upgrade forKirby and the Forgotten Land, which adds a whole new expansion to the game? Maybe, maybe not. To complicate things further, theSwitch 2 Edition upgrades forBreath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomwill be included in a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription, but others won’t.
That’s not all. Nintendo is also offering asecond tier of free Switch 2 patchesfor games likeSuper Mario OdysseyandPokémon ScarletandViolet. These don’t count as full Switch 2 Editions, but they will “improve playability” and “may improve performance or add support for features such asGameShare,” depending on the game.
As with PS5, it’s quite a confusing picture — especially since we don’t yet know pricing, or how third-party publishers will choose to handle Switch 2 Editions. (On PlayStation, many — if not most — opted to offer free upgrades.) But there is one important factor that distinguishes Nintendo’s strategy from Sony’s.
The only enhancements offered by many PS5 upgrades were in terms of visuals and performance: higher resolutions and frame rates, ray-traced lighting, or new performance and quality modes. Players felt they were being asked to spend $10 per game to unlock the power of the console they had already bought.
Nintendo seems to have a policy that visual upgrades aren’t enough for a Switch 2 Edition. The Zelda games come with the (admittedly not very compelling) Zelda Notes companion features.Super Mario Party Jamboreehas a new play mode, and makes extensive use of Switch 2 features like mouse controls and the camera.Kirby and the Forgotten Landhas a whole new story.Metroid Prime 4: Beyondhas mouse controls. It seems clear that Nintendo always wants to add value in a Switch 2 Edition, either through additional content, use of the Switch 2’s unique features (beyond its increased processing power), or both. Some of these releases — Kirby and Mario Party especially — would seem to be on a par with the Switch’s Deluxe editions of Wii U games likeMario Kart 8andNew Super Mario Bros. U. (There’s one exception to this rule: The Switch 2 Edition ofPokémon Legends: Z-Adoes not feature any upgrades beyond a visual one, at least for now.)
That should make the upgrade pack cost, however much it may be, easier to stomach. (Charging for upgrade packs will surely make all that extra development time easier for Nintendo to stomach.) It’s a fairer proposition than Sony’s, if hardly a less confusing one. But Xbox owners — and PC gamers, for that matter, who never have to worry about such things — would be justified in feeling quite smug by comparison.

"The dark tales of the Deep South
byJason Rodriguez
Early on in my near-12-hourSouth of Midnightplaythrough, I defeated Two-Toed Tom, a gargantuan andlegendaryalligator that’s said to have stalked the swamplands of Florida and Alabama as early as the 1920s. After breathing a sigh of relief upon completing the battle, I was shocked when Two-Toed Tom swallowed my character, Hazel, whole. I was even more surprised upon realizing that I had to escape the gator’s belly in a platforming section complete with floating planks, ruined houses, and even a lost pig — everything that Tom had previously gobbled up.
Indeed,South of Midnightis the melding of the weird and the macabre, the magical and the utterly dreadful, a tantalizing offering that delves deeper into its roots in the Deep South. However, it still has some glaring flaws, most notably with its combat system.
InSouth of Midnight, you play as Hazel Flood, a young woman searching for her mother after a hurricane devastates the town of Prospero. After a few twists and turns, you learn that Hazel is a Weaver, someone who wields magic to see through the material plane and into a world that’s shrouded in shadow and spiritual essences.
What follows is an unforgettable journey where you meet a host of characters and creatures derived from Southern folklore. These include the giant catfish, a staple of old tales in the region; the aforementioned Two-Toed Tom; and even a giant man known as Shakin’ Bones, who’s partly based on Charon, the ferryman of the dead from Greek mythology, and blues legend Robert Johnson, rumored to havesold his soul to the devil to become a master at guitar.
There are also terrifying beings whose stories are unique to certain locations, such asHuggin’ Molly. Molly was believed to be a phantom woman who’d find naughty children who were out at night in the quaint town of Abbeville, Alabama. She’d swoop in and squeeze kids tightly before shrieking into their ears. Likewise, there’s theAltamaha-ha, a sea monster whose legend is rooted in Muscogee tradition, and with multiple alleged sightings in parts of Georgia.
South of Midnighteasily pulled me in through its masterful use of engrossing folklore and tall tales, though it’s the nuanced exploration of dark themes and harsh realities that truly resonated with me. You see, Hazel’s job as a Weaver is to mend stigmas, wounds caused by heinous acts — wounds that fester in the immaterial realm before seeping into reality. The story is filled with emotionally impactful moments, such as with Hazel’s mother, a social worker who’s looking for a way to save impoverished kids who have been failed by the system, and that of the ghosts of plantation slaves finding their way to freedom. Just as well, there are equally disturbing segments of the game’s story, including fratricide, bullying, animal abuse, and hatefulness against those deemed to be too different.
Look, I won’t pretend that I’m an expert in Southern gothic lore or history — I live in the Philippines, which is 9,000 miles away from any state in the Bible Belt. The closest I’ve been to the South was when I worked in Virginia for a few months back in 2004, and that’s still quite far from Georgia or Alabama.
That said,South of Midnightdid present stark truths that are relatable all the same. In some ways, my people, too, relied on the power of mysticism, superstition, and folktales to shape our Filipino identity and to become more resilient in the face of adversity. It’s not uncommon for people in the provinces to warn you of creatures liketikbalangs,kapres, andduwendes, or to espouse the protective and restorative properties of mystical beliefs (which also clash with traditional Catholic teachings). Moreover, the game’s narrative draws on the universal themes of hope and determination: that there are people out there who are willing to help, that there are ways to heal the traumatic events of the past, and that children will move heaven and earth for their parents (and vice versa).
South of Midnight’s story is further enhanced by striking visuals and the use of stop-motion animation in cutscenes. While the latter might be hard to get used to at first — you’ll be roaming around the swamps at a blistering pace, then see a stop-motion cutscene at a lower frame rate — the concept ultimately adds to the gothic-fantasy charm. In the same vein, the soundtrack, made by composer Olivier Derivière (A Plague Tale: Innocence/RequiemandVampyr), might be one of the best I’ve had the joy of listening to in recent memory. There’s a mix of melodic blues and country music, as well as a church hymn at one point. The song lyrics themselves either focus on Hazel’s plight or pertain to a particular boss, punctuating every significant moment in the campaign, from the somber expressions of grief to the pulse-pounding crescendo of an upcoming battle.
The exploration and platforming mechanics, which reminded me somewhat of Ember Lab’sKena: Bridge of Spirits, are exceptionally well designed, too. The game’s 14 levels — consisting of (mostly) fetid swamplands and mountainside villages, as well as a short trek to a glitzy New Orleans-esque city, albeit one with landmasses floating over a vast expanse — are all fairly linear. That said, exploration is still encouraged, as there are small areas that are off the beaten path. Some of these contain health filaments, which upgrade Hazel’s HP, or a resource called Floofs, which are used to unlock skills in a very bare-bones skill tree.
On top of this, Hazel gains a plethora of powers and abilities in just a few hours, allowing you to make use of various traversal methods, like a magical grapple to cross gaps, wind currents to fly through the air, a spell that solidifies spectral objects, and a Force Pull/Force Push-esque ability reminiscent of a Jedi. There’s even a reanimated doll, Crouton, perhaps a nod to Hoodoo spiritualism, that you control to gain access to small areas and burrows. Additionally, you can make a wispy guiding path appear with the press of a button, showing the way forward complete with disembodied voices calling out to your character.
My only complaint with regard to overall level design is that I wish puzzles were trickier and more expansive. There were instances when Hazel would remark about how a contraption might need power or that she had to reach a certain location, yet the solutions to these problems were simple. Sometimes, all I had to do was make Crouton push a switch in a small nook or toss a rock at a breakable object. Having more brain teasers would have enriched the game’s fantasy and mystery elements.
Regrettably, the combat system inSouth of Midnightis its weakest aspect. As you make your way through each level, you come across larger clusters of stigma that spawn monsters known as “haints” (a Southern term for ghosts or evil spirits). Enemy variety is fairly limited, as you end up facing shadowy specters that use claws, exploding flies, or gooey spit. To take out these foes, you use Hazel’s aforementioned traversal abilities, which have their own equivalent effects in combat; you can temporarily stun foes by solidifying them, you can push/pull enemies, and you can make Crouton take control of a hostile to attack its own cohorts.
Level progression feels like it’s structured with combat encounters in mind, and the result is that all the levels feel the same after a while. Essentially, this consists of exploring a section, finding a stigma cluster, defeating a couple of enemy waves to finish the encounter, watching a short cutscene about the past, and then clearing the remaining clusters, before going through a chase sequence where an otherworldly entity is hot on your heels. The last part — the chase sequence — is exciting, but the rest is mostly just lather, rinse, and repeat until you’re done.
The battles themselves are very forgiving even on normal difficulty; your dodges cause damaging explosions, and you can heal by unraveling defeated enemies or by interacting with a glowing green orb. However, the structure became too repetitive to a fault that, at the halfway point, I honestly wondered if I should just enable the “Skip Combat” option so I could get to the good parts faster. Outside of a select few bouts against bosses and mythical creatures, there are no other encounters that offer the same level of excitement. It’s a darn shame given how much the game excels when it comes to the “adventure” aspect, and yet the “action” part is egregiously boring and uninspired.
All in all, even with my qualms about the combat system,South of Midnightstill managed to exceed my expectations. It has the 3D platforming goodness that should appeal to fans of the genre, and levels that are a joy to explore from a traversal standpoint. More importantly, its compelling story hooks you with its excellent use of the often underrepresented Deep South as a setting, along with its rich folktales and troubled history. And yes, it comes as no surprise that the game explores dark and unsettling themes, all while reminding us that love, forgiveness, and acceptance help mend old wounds.
South of Midnightwill have an early access release on April 3 and a wide release on April 8 on Windows PC and Xbox Series X. The game was reviewed on PC using a copy provided by Compulsion Games.

"Old man yells at The Cloud
byChristopher Grant
It’s a good thing that theNintendo Switch 2comes with a base 256 GB of internal storage — eight times more than the original Switch’s paltry 32 GB — because some Nintendo Switch 2 games won’t come on the cartridge at all. Instead, so-called game-key cards will simply contain a “key” that you will use to download the game, according toa support page on Nintendo’s website.
“After it’s downloaded, you can play the game by inserting the game-key card into your system and starting it up like a standard physical game card,” the page reads. Here’s how that looks on the retail packaging:
Some additional fine print on how this works:
An internet connection is only required when you launch the game for the first time. After this, the game can be started even without an internet connection. However, like regular physical software, the game-key card must be inserted into the system in order to play the game.
In some ways, this is a new spin on an old trick. Some Nintendo Switch games have been sold at retail, but the packaging simply included a code used to download the game to your account. To be fair, this hasn’t been as common on Switch as it has been on competing consoles, but nevertheless, for the people still committed to purchasing physical games, it riles. This is, in fact, the same tactic that Microsoft (in)famously unveiled alongside the Xbox One; of course, that was over a decade ago, and consumer sentiment has changed. We’re all Game Passing and PS Plus-ing our games, and maybe potentially feel some “ownership” over the digital goods we’re purchasing on Steam. Maybe.
But I’m one of those physical media people! First, I’m scientifically “old.” I was born in the 1970s, my first job was at a video store (ask your parents), and I still have a large collection of video games (and video game consoles ?). I understand that I am not the target demographic, in many ways. But also, until the Switch, the prospect of purchasing digital Nintendo games was foolish! If you lost your Nintendo DS or 3DS on a bus — a not-unheard-of scenario for a portable game console — your digital purchases were gone. Here I am yelling aboutNintendo’s shoddy online servicesin2012 just before the launch of the Wii U, and again in2017 just before the launch of the Switch.
The good news: I don’t need to write that same piece again! Nintendo has kinda figured this out. I still buy my Switch games in cartridge format, not because I’m afraid of losing the Switch (and, by extension, my entire library), but because doing so makes it easier to share games with friends and family, including people in my own household. But I also genuinely worry about what happens when companies — and maybe, specifically here, Nintendo — take their own game servers offline. Can I download what I bought?How do I play older gamesI care about? Microsoft has been working to address theunsatisfactory vibes of digital ownership, and I often point out that my Steam library persists even as so (so, so) many of the developers and publishers behind the games in my Steam library no longer do.
So let’s call this a sign of the times. We don’t know how often Nintendo and its publishing partners will use this “game-key card” solution, and maybe in some cases it’s the right answer — surely some games will simply be too large to fit on this storage device. Switch game cards capped out at 32 GB, while thecoming-to-Switch-2Cyberpunk 2077comes on a massive 64 GB game card, according to a press release. That’s a lot of expensive one-time storage, and with the Switch 2 competing with the PlayStations and Xboxes of the world foreven more third-party titles, you can imagine storage requirements going up from there. Even if it maybe makes sense, I don’t have to like it.
[Update: Added details on theCyberpunk 2077game card size, and information on internet requirements to use game-key cards.]

"The developers ofAstroneerwere robbed of their trailer debut
byTyler Colp
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Nintendo’s Switch 2 Directstream suffered technical issues at the most inopportune time for the developers ofAstroneer. Near the end of Wednesday’s presentation, a trailer for their new game debuted on the stream during a period where many viewers were stuck looking at a glitchy mess.
“Hey so uh one of the mainNintendo Switch 2 Directstreams completely ate our trailer due to I guess technical difficulties?” System Era Softworks social media manager Lotus Dwyer wrote onBluesky.
The new game is calledStarseeker: Astroneer Expeditions, and if things had gone right, you could’ve recognized the similarities to the studio’s previous game almost immediately. It’s a cooperative game with colorful planets full of weird creatures and plant life. TheBluesky postwith the trailer describes it as a game about “the joy of discovery and the camaraderie that emerges from an evolving, cooperative experience,” which suggests your crew of goofy astronauts will visit many different planets than the one we saw.
Over on theSteam page, the description points out that each planet will have different objectives that can only be completed by using your team’s set of tools. Between missions, you’ll return to “an ever-evolving space station” known as the ESS Starseeker to get upgrades and plan your next expedition.
System Era Softworks saysStarseekertakes place in theAstroneeruniverse, but isn’t a direct sequel.Astroneerwill continue to be updated “for years to come.”

"Why Nintendo wants Madden and Borderlands on its new handheld
byChris Plante
Nintendo took an unusual approach to the past two decades of video game console wars. It stayed out of them. But with today’sNintendo Switch 2 info dump— packed with big-name third-party games rarely seen onNintendo hardware— the House that Mario Built appears ready to rejoin the fray. Why now? Credit a collision of confidence, opportunity, and necessity.
Sony and Microsoft have spent generations bloodying each other in a battle for the most extravagant visuals, courting favor with major publishers like Activision and Electronic Arts. Meanwhile, Nintendo swam in the opposite direction, favoring cheaper, less powerful machines that prioritized toy-like novelty over raw specs.
The historic successes of both the Wii and the Switch obscure how risky this gamble has been. The slower hardware — with a few, better-forgotten exceptions — couldn’t run the latest entries in gaming’s most popular franchises, including Madden, Call of Duty, and Grand Theft Auto. Survival hinged on Nintendo’s ability to produce multiple exclusive hits each year, with smaller indie titles filling the gaps.
With the Switch, everything went Nintendo’s way — by both design and good fortune. The publisher assembled arguably the greatest first-party lineup in history. Indie development exploded. And a new wave of beloved IP —Minecraft,Fortnite, Roblox — designed for smartphone-level specs meant that Nintendo’s hardware, unintentionally, could play some of the biggest games on the planet.
And yet, today, Nintendo’s hourlongSwitch 2reveal stream featured anabundance of titlesonce rare on its systems. 2K Games showed off new entries in the WWE, Civilization, and Borderlands franchises. Other developers, like IO Interactive, pledged to bring hits once best experienced on Xbox or PlayStation, like Hitman and the upcomingProject 007. Square Enix showed theremakes ofFinal Fantasy 7, and EA appeared, committing EA Sports FC and Madden to the platform.
It’s possible that coming off the success of the Switch — a far cry from Nintendo’s grim posture after the Wii U — the gamemaker feels positioned to push into the third-party territory ceded to Sony and Microsoft, the latter of which seems to be clinging to its hardware business by its fingertips. After all, Nintendo has sold over 150 million Switch consoles — more than the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S combined.
It’s also possible a mix of luck and industry trends will once again favor Nintendo. Sony and Microsoft’s reluctance to fully leave the PS4 and Xbox One era behind — coupled with a generation raised on mobile gaming — has trained AAA developers to build for underpowered hardware. TheSwitch 2will still trail behind top-tier machines in horsepower, but that may no longer matter. Most major franchises simply don’t demand cutting-edge specs.
Both of those are likely a piece of the puzzle. But I believe Nintendo’s decision to release amore expensiveand slightly morepowerful devicemay have less to do with past console wars and more to do with its biggest threat in the present. In 2025, Valve’s Steam Deck does what the Switch doesn’t: It lets players enjoy most AAA games anytime, anywhere — and offers many of the same indie titles at steep discounts. (That it also runs emulated games from every Nintendo console ever released surely isn’t lost on the company either, as it continues its crackdown on third-party emulation.)
If Nintendo once again ignores third parties and their graphical needs, it would find itself competing against a growing number of handhelds that offer more power and more games, often with better specs — albeit higher prices.
Inexplicably, Microsoft and Sony burned an entire hardware cycle without answering the Switch’s key selling point: portability. It took a PC gaming marketplace — with almost no hardware pedigree — to offer legitimate competition. And Nintendo, with the Switch 2’s higher price, greater power, and suite of PC-like social features, seems to be taking the threat seriously.
Yes, Nintendo has reentered the modern console wars. Maybe, one day, Sony and Microsoft will too.

"Nintendo’s new Mario Kart is pricey
byMichael McWhertor
We knew there was a new Mario Kart coming to Switch 2, but we didn’t expect it to cost this much. After showing off the open-world racing gameMario Kart Worldon Wednesday during itsSwitch 2 Nintendo Directshowcase, Nintendo revealed that the game will have a $79.99 price tag. That’s new territory for Nintendo, which just two years ago made headlines bycharging $69.99forThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
ButMario Kart World’s high asking price doesn’t appear to be the standard for Switch 2 software. Nintendo also confirmed Wednesday thatDonkey Kong Bananza, coming to Switch 2 in July, will cost $69.99. Still, these are indicators that Nintendo is comfortable charging more not just for the Switch successor, but for its next-gen games too.
Those prices may only represent the digital versions of those Switch 2 games. Pricing announced in some territories shows that Nintendo plans to charge even more for the physical editions of games likeMario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananza.
Nintendo has not announced prices for other games or the Switch 2 upgrade packs that were revealed as part of Wednesday’s Nintendo Direct, though it did put a price on another Switch 2 launch game,Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, if only in Japan. That virtual exploration of the Switch 2 hardware will cost 990 yen for a digital copy, which will probably translate to a sub-$10 price in the U.S.
Price increases on software aren’t uncommon during next-generation console transitions. When the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 launched, standard game pricing jumped from $49.99 to $59.99, a price point that held steady for more than a decade. In 2020, alongside the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, prices crept up further, with some publishers charging $69.99 for certain games. Nintendo itself caught up with that trend withTears of the Kingdom,following Microsoft’s lead, with its first $69.99 game.
Despite the reality of inflation, the increasing cost of game development, and the value often associated with live-service games like Mario Kart, reaction to pricing for Switch 2 games has beenwidely negative. Combined with thehigh price of the Switch 2itself, Nintendo may have a harder time reaching the success of the original Switch than some expected.

"It’s-a me, economic anxiety over inflation and US tariffs
byChristopher Grant
January’s Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event took the wraps off the console, but left a lot of details unanswereduntil now. After the initial reveal, I put togetheran analysis of the possible pricingfor the console, using Nintendo’s own historical pricing strategies to guide my thinking. My conclusion then was that it would cost $399.
I…was wrong. The Nintendo Switch 2 will debut in Junestarting at $449.99, with a $499.99 version that includesMario Kart World.
At that price, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be the most expensive console Nintendo has ever released, by some margin. And even adjusted for inflation, and when considering the various bundle packages of previous Nintendo consoles, the Nintendo Switch 2 will still be the most expensive Nintendo console ever made!
It’s not quite June yet, so I can’t update this chart to reflect the inflation-adjusted price to the same date of the Switch 2 launch, but the prices from February of this year are pretty illustrative of the change here.
[Ed. note:An earlier version of this list didn’t include information on pack-in games included in some console releases, and didn’t include the various NES bundles and prices. Adjusted for inflation, only the very first NES release — a tricked-out bundle originally limited to test markets only — would be more expensive than the Nintendo Switch 2. Once you compare it to the more widely released Control Deck release just a few months later, the relative cost of the Nintendo Switch 2 is clear.]
But it wasn’t just me that was wrong! Nearly 57% of ourpoll respondents agreedwith my predicted $399 price, and just 9% thought it would come in at $449. (If that was you, congratulations!) Is that indicative that Nintendo will have a hard time moving units at $449, or simply that people didn’t think Nintendo would go that high? It’s too early to say.
Earlier reporting from Bloomberg, citing multiple industry analysts, pegged the pricebetween $399 and $499, so… nailed it?
On price, the analysts Bloomberg spoke to are unanimous in expecting the Switch 2 to cost at least $399 — which, again, agrees with Polygon’s own analysis. Some think it could go higher, to $449 or even $499, driven by the cost of components and fears over the impact of U.S. tariffs. At $499 it would be the same price as a PlayStation 5 (and $50 more than a digital-only model).
Here again is a list of all of the current-gen consoles, now including the Switch 2 and its confirmed pricing:
At $449, the Switch 2 will go toe to toe on pricing with the all-digital variants of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, which is in keeping with the Switch’s 2017 launch price that matched the $299 being asked for the PS4 Slim and Xbox One S. It’s worth noting, however, that $299 in 2017 dollars still comes in under $400 in today’s bucks, when adjusted for inflation. It’s not just you — everything really is just more expensive!
One last consideration: While the Switch 2’s specs actually put it a notch above the Steam Deck in some key categories, like resolution and including a 4K-compatible dock out of the box, I didn’t expect Valve’s portable gaming PC to beat Nintendo on pricing. The Steam Deck APU is going on three years old at this point, and a little long in the tooth, but it’s hard to argue against the value embedded in Valve’s storefront. (I boughtUndertalefor $1 recently just to have another copy.) So with Valve continuing to make a name for itself, and with Microsoftreportedly entering the portable gaming spacethis year in partnership with Asus, Nintendo no longer has the exclusive lock on the portable gaming market.
Update: I updated the headline and some of the opening paragraphs, along with the first pricing comparison chart, to reflect that when evaluated on a more like-to-like basis the Nintendo Switch 2, with and without a pack-in game, is in fact the most expensive Nintendo console ever released, when adjusted for inflation.

We have a full view ofNintendo Switch 2 gamesnow theApril 2 Directhas come and gone — including a number of exclusives andlaunch titles, and that all-importantrelease datefor the console itself.
It follows months of slim pickings following the console’s initial hardware-focused reveal in January, which also saw developers and publishers holding fire of their involvement until now.
The following Switch 2 games list explains the exclusives, third-party games, and confirmed developers and publishers for the console from the launch and beyond.
Update (April 8):Added two new games —Mouse Workand a Switch 2 version of the recentSuikoden I&II HDremaster.
First, let’s look at the exclusive games coming to the Switch 2, whether that’s from Nintendo itself or from third-parties:
As well as the above full exclusives, there’s a series of“Nintendo Switch 2 Edition”titles, which are Switch 1 games “patched” to make the most out of the Switch 2 hardware (and is different tobackward compatibility). These are available as both “upgrade packs” if you own the Switch 1 version, or as standalone editions for the Switch 2:
Elsewhere, those with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription will get the following“GameCube Classics”from launch day:
As well as the above list of exclusives and Switch 2-specific editions of Switch 1 games, here’s a breakdown of other games confirmed for the Switch 2 from third-parties that are either already on other systems, or are debuting on multiple platforms:

"﻿The creators of Elden Ring are making a game for the Switch 2
byAna Diaz
FromSoftware, the renowned development studio behind popular games likeElden Ringand the Dark Souls series, announced a brand new game at theNintendo Directon Wednesday. It’s calledThe Duskbloodsand it’s set to be released sometime in 2026, exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2.
The Duskbloodsis an online multiplayer game that supports up to eight players, per thegame’s official website.
The developers aired a short trailer that showed off some of the world and general concepts behind the game. It’s dripping in dark, gothic vibes and the opening intro references an unknown knight of “light.” The game appears to feature a completely original concept with a new world and cast of characters (one of which looks like it preys on a monster like a vampire). That said, the title of the game has many wondering if it’s set in theBloodborneuniverse.
The news comes just after FromSoftware made another big announcement at the Nintendo Switch 2 event. Its global hit,Elden Ring, will be getting a Switch 2 port so even more people will be able to take up the journey and fight as The Tarnished. (TheElden Ring Tarnished Editionport will be released in 2025).
As for non-Switch 2 news, FromSoftware still has some other projects cooking. The studio’s next big game,Elden Ring Nightreign, is set to be released on May 30. There was no mention ofNightreignat the Direct and as of writing, thefast-paced, co-op spinoffwill be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.
For those who want to learn more, game director Hidetaka Miyazaki will share more aboutThe Duskbloodsin a developer diary series called Creator’s Voice on Friday.

"See Hyrule the way it was meant to be seen
bySamit Sarkar
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomfans will be able to see the era-defining Nintendo titles in a new light on Nintendo Switch 2 with a duo of enhanced visual upgrades, Nintendo announced Wednesday during itsNintendo Direct presentation about the new console. If you already own the games, you won’t automatically have the Switch 2 version and will need to purchase an upgrade pack to get it. However, Switch Online subscribers who have the Expansion Pack tier and own copies of these games will get the upgrades for no additional cost, according toNintendo.
The Switch 2 version of each game will include a “Zelda Notes” feature, which will provide game tips to players; you can use this Switch 2-only feature via the Nintendo Switch app on smart devices. It can help you find Korok seeds, for example. That’s in addition to enhanced resolution and frame rates and HDR support.
Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomhave earned their place among the greatest video games of all time, and delivered on the promise of a truly open-world Zelda game where you could see a mountain in the distance and then go climb it. Both games managed this feat on the Switch, which, as a device designed for both big-screen and handheld play, was significantly underpowered compared to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (and later, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X).
Of course, this experience wasn’t without its compromises; at launch forBreath of the Wild, certain areas of the world exhibitednotable performance problems, especially when played in the Switch’s docked mode. Less than a month later,Nintendo issued a patch that made significant improvementsbut didn’t completely alleviate frame-rate drops below 30 frames per second.
Now, the Switch 2’s beefed-up hardware will be able to renderBreath of the Wild’s version of Hyrule with a much fuller degree of fidelity and fluidity.
Update: Added that Switch Online subscribers with the Expansion Pack tier get both Switch 2 Edition versions ofBreath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomfor no added cost if you own them already.

"Less than 24 hours remain until Nintendo’s big Switch 2 Direct
byMichael McWhertor
It’s the dawn of the final day. On Wednesday, April 2, Nintendo promises to give its fans a closer look atSwitch 2, the successor to its wildly popular portable-console hybrid. And while Nintendo is famously secretive and unpredictable, there’s a lot we already know about Switch 2.
Still, there are manyunanswered questions about Switch 2, and Nintendo’s ability to keep information under wraps and preserve surprises means that what we think we know about the next-generation Switch likely pales in comparison to whatthis week’s 60-minute Nintendo Directwill reveal.
That said, here are our best predictions for the impending Nintendo Direct that’s all about Switch 2.
With the Switch 2 expected to launch as early as June, Nintendo will likely reveal the release date, price, and when customers can pre-order the system. Based on what we’ve heard,Switch 2 pre-orders should go live at most retailers on April 9, giving Nintendo fans a window to consider their purchases and not have to scramble to pre-order one immediately after the Nintendo Direct. (In some territories, like Nintendo’s home base in Japan, the Direct won’t conclude until late at night.)
Switch 2, based on what we’ve heard, is expected to launch in the first half of June.
We expect the price to besomewhere between $399 and $449. Nintendo may be waiting until the very last minute to decide price, which — inthiseconomy — seems like a tough decision to make.
Nintendo not only added a brand-new button to the Switch 2 Joy-Cons, it’s beenteasing that new C button’s functionalityahead of time on its recently launched Nintendo Today app. What the C button does is still a mystery for now, but all signs point to a new chat tool or community-focused feature.
We’ll find out what the C button is for, officially, on Wednesday. But based on Nintendo’s increasing fascination with big multiplayer games, and last year’sNintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program, which tested “the boundaries of mass multiplayer functionality and gameplay” on Nintendo’s servers, we expect some sort of big, Nintendo-controlled community feature or MMO-scale game to be shown — and that would be a great opportunity to showcase the new C button functionality, if it is indeed chat- or community-focused.
We’re getting a new Mario Kart, that’s for sure. But what else Nintendo has planned for Switch 2 is a big mystery. We expect at least one game to show off theSwitch 2 Joy-Cons’ new mouse-control featuresand probably a new Super Mario game.
Nintendo also has to give Switch owners a long list of reasons to upgrade to Switch 2, and the best way to do that is through compelling software.Mario Kart 9would be a big deal, of course, but we expect Nintendo to show up with a teaser or announcement of at least one other big franchise, like Animal Crossing, Super Smash Bros., or Splatoon.
But Nintendo will also likely showcase how well Switch games run on Switch 2. Maybe the best way to do that would be to showThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildorTears of the Kingdomrunning on Switch 2, at higher resolution and with better frame rates. First details on“Switch 2 Edition” versions of gameswill definitely be a talking point.
Third-party software publishers will likely open the floodgates of their back catalogs to bring games from PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X to a new console. But don’t expect that flood of ports to be showcased at the Nintendo Direct. Instead, we anticipate that only a handful of major third-party publishers like Capcom, Sega, Microsoft, and Ubisoft will get some space during the Direct to show their support for Switch 2.
Nintendo is reportedly being cautious about which third-party developers are getting Switch 2 development kits ahead of launch, but we expect that to change once details about the new system are in the wild.

"The PlayStation classics are emulated (almost) flawlessly
byClayton Ashley
The exceptionalArmored Core 6: Fires of Rubiconis easy to purchase and play on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or PC. Every other game in the series? Not so much.Most of the previous 15 Armored Core games aren’t available on digital storefronts or backward-compatible on modern systems. That is, until March, when the very firstArmored Coreand its two expansion games for the PlayStationwere made available for digital purchase, and for free for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers on PS4 and PS5.
Though it’s nearly 30 years old,Armored Coreholds up incredibly well. Despite its odd control setup, it’s easy to see how the series’ high-speed mecha gameplay inspired such a devoted fan base. The bright, retro polygonal graphics look pristine on modern high-definition televisions, and customizing your Armored Core is still the absorbing heart of the experience. It’s also a chance to see the wild ideas FromSoftware was cooking up decades ago, like the new game plus mode you could only access by going into debt.
This was called “Human PLUS,” and it tied into the game’s dystopian sci-fi story. Completing missions earned players credits, but a chunk of their payment was always taken out to cover repairs and ammo for their Armored Core. Earning money meant buying better parts, but failing a mission meantlosingmoney. Going into debt by at least 50,000 credits would trigger Human PLUS, restarting the game while upgrading the player’s character by meshing them cybernetically with their Armored Core. Sure, you lost some of your humanity, but you improved your shoulder-mounted weapon performance in the process.
These upgrades were quite significant, and made it easier for players to complete the game. Even better, when you bought the sequelsProject PhantasmaandMaster of Arena, you could import your save and bring along your arsenal and your Human PLUS upgrades into what were considered tougher games. Or at least youcouldon the original PlayStation. Currently, the versions in the PlayStation Plus Classics Catalog cannot import game saves from one another.
According to Forbes, the developer of these ports, Implicit Conversions, appears to be aware of the issue and will hopefully provide a patch in the future. Some special parts that should only have been accessible inProject Phantasmavia the save import feature were found in the game’s shop, meaning the developer must have been aware that these parts wouldn’t have otherwise been accessible. However, not all of these special parts are for sale, and there’s still no way to get the Human PLUS upgrades in that game orMaster of Arena.
While I hope a patch makes it possible to import saves in the future,Armored Coreis still absolutely worth playing for any curious PlayStation Plus subscribers. Here’s hoping we get the other 12 games in the franchise a little sooner."
"Rebellion’s stealth game demands you walk boldly out into the unknown
byMatt Patches
Rebellion’s stealth game demands you walk boldly out into the unknown
byMatt Patches
Forget the number of hours it takes for a game to “get good” — how am I spending the first15 minutes?
Call me impatient, but a game’s opening seconds, even those introductory moments as a character comes alive or a world opens up, are make-or-break for how far I am willing to soldier on into what could be 20, 30, or 100 hours of play. So what a relief it was to fire upAtomfall, the new stealth-driven survival adventure from Sniper Elite developer Rebellion now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox (via Game Pass), and feel immediately dunked into its radioactive mystery.
Atomfalltakes place in an alt-universe patch of northwestern Englandwhere a nuclear disaster has left buildings crumbled and society torn apart. There are paramilitaries operating walled-off towns and pagan cults stalking the open fields. A dash of retrofuture machinery gives the backdrop a Fallout flavor (intentional), while the mannerisms and encounters are delightfully British (“press X to pour tea”). There’s lots to discover, and enough jank to the physics to build an aura of danger — in “the zone,” you’re in the wild.
None of this is spelled out when your first-person avatar wakes up confused, underground, and faced with a decision to help or hurt an ailing doctor who dangles the first of the game’s many mysteries in front of you. You grab a backpack and a few supplies and rush out the door into the devastated but sunny Cumberland countryside, with only a few breadcrumbs scattered to let you know where to go next. My first time booting upAtomfallwas at 11 p.m. on a weary Wednesday night; I was terrified by the stillness of the land and thrilled to decide in which direction to run. For all its Fallout andSTALKERconnections,Mystcame to mind more than once.
Not too long before jumping intoAtomfall, I trudged through the opening hours ofAssassin’s Creed Shadows, the definition of the AAA open-world experience that offers so much at the end of the tunnel.A long, long, long tunnel. Dozens of foundational cutscenes aside, my initial time withShadowsfelt like booking a trip to Disney World then immediately beelining to the monorail. Even the tutorial-fueled cold open ofShadows, which finds up-and-coming samurai Yasuke plowing through baddies, felt so on rails as to grind my interest to a halt. Not every game needs a mystery to propel it forward (thoughShadowskinda has one), and I welcome a guided tutorial to intricate systems that will soon replace family birthdays and login passwords in my memory. ButShadows’ first two hours of play lacked the flicker of immediacy. After I adjust brightness and calibrate controls and shuffle through character creation options, I want to accomplish something right away — something more than just pressing buttons.
Instead of a preface laying out the whos and whats and wheres,Atomfall’s opening demands investigation. At first, the only clues are in the scenery — an ethereal light beaming from behind nuclear cooling towers, scintillating against the moorland like the Shimmer inAnnihilation— and a few hints from the doctor that suggest a direction. Typical on-screen prompts explain crafting, combat, and stealth, but knowing how the systems work inAtomfallrequires some experimentation. What’s worth making room for in your inventory? Live a little, and you’ll figure it out. How do you survive a spat with a local outlaw? Pray to god the cricket bat you just picked up is a decent weapon. How do you successfully trespass through a military encampment without tipping off the guards? That streammightmuffle your steps. Maybe.
Atomfall’s investigations leave a similar curiosity gap, relying on clues and coordinates to get you to the next milestone moment instead of obvious map landmarks. It’s not anotebook game, but I felt in total control of where my detective brain wanted to go next — or didn’t. There are a number of bunkers and other dimly lit death traps scattered around the hills of the radiation zone, and early on, when I felt bold enough to flick on my torch (or as the non-Brits say, flashlight), I descended down to ultimately meet my demise. The nuclear fallout has not been kind to every local.
I have many more hours to go inAtomfall, but it’s a relief that it didn’t take even an hour to feel absorbed by Rebellion’s pitch. The setup kicked me out the door. The gameplay dropped me into the unknown. Without a clue, I started walking. Having broken into a mine haunted by shadowy figures, hit the gate of a compound that may unlock the secrets of this disaster, met a vicar who begged me to keep a discovered murder a secret… I want to keep digging.
Rebellion is right to say thatAtomfallis“AA punching up.”The game is modest in size, but the scope seems to have created greater urgency in the pacing. Games of much smaller scale — a retro platformer, a pixel life sim — also ask you to hit start and learn as you go. There are AAA games with similar immediacy (Baldur’s Gate 3comes to mind), but many more that prioritize graphical polish and the vastness of their mechanics before getting around to the reason we all showed up.
Atomfalllands between the two for me, thanks to genre and a simple bit of cinema logic: show, don’t tell. If you see a door, you’ll run to it. Then you’ll keep running. You’ll figure out the rest — or die trying.
Atomfallis out now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

"This week’s games balance horror and joy
byTyler Colp
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
The new game releases this week waver between horrifying and charming. Sometimes the premise of a game is pretty sad on its face, but the stuff you do isn’t as bleak. That’s the case for a couple games arriving this week. However, that’s not true forThe Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, a game fully committed to misery. There are cheerful moments in it, though, so it technically counts. Just don’t go into it expecting to spend 40 hours riffing on Ellie’s guitar.
Koiradrops just before the rest of the games on the list arrive on Thursday. It’s a game about exploring a forest with a lost puppy, and if I think too hard about where that story might go I’ll cry. Then there’s Naughty Dog’s bleak, post-apocalyptic shooter where you can’t go 45 minutes without watching something awful happen.Sandalso comes out on that day and brings a fun twist to the extraction shooter genre: spider tanks. AndCaligoandSephiriaare two games that look more pleasant than they actually are. One of them lets you play as a bunny warrior, though.

"Nintendo’s full reveal will hopefully answer all of these unknowns
byMichael McWhertor
This story was first published in Switchboard, a newsletter from Polygon that delivers all the latest Switch 2 news, reporting, and rumors directly to your inbox.Sign up hereto get it weekly.
This time next week, we’ll know a lot more about theNintendo Switch 2. A newNintendo Direct showcasededicated to the top-secret handheld console will air on the morning of Wednesday, April 2. That presentation will offer a first look at new games, hardware details, and hopefully much more.
Ahead of the event, we have a long list of questions that Nintendo still needs to answer. Here are some of the biggest unknowns about Switch 2.
Some of the biggest questions we’re hoping will be addressed during the Nintendo Direct surround the new Joy-Con controllers. Will they have Hall effect joysticks, as previously reported? And does that mean stick drift is a thing of the past?
How will the rumoredmouse control features of the Joy-Conswork? More crucially, do Joy-Cons actually feel good as mice? Are players going to need a dedicated mousing surface, or will a coffee tabletop or couch surface suffice?
Importantly, how do the new, larger Joy-Cons feel in the hand? Will those bigger shoulder buttons work as well as we’d hoped? And what does thatnew “C” button on the right Joy-Condo?
The Switch’s Joy-Cons were a pretty radical reinvention for game controllers, both revolutionary and quite flawed. That’s why the full reveal of the Joy-Con (2.0) controllers will be so fascinating to watch, to see how Nintendo moves its design forward and fixes the original version’s shortcomings.
Officially, we only know of one Nintendo-developed game coming to Switch 2 at this point: a new Mario Kart game. But Nintendo has reportedly been building up a strong library of internally developed Switch 2 games, and while we have some ideas about which dev teams could be working on which franchises, Nintendo is excellent at keeping secrets and delivering surprises.
Arecurrent-gen Switch games being developed with Switch 2 in mind, meaning will they support higher resolutions and improved frame rates? (Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Editionmay have already answered this question.)
Frankly, I think we’re all wondering which Nintendo franchises will show up during the Switch 2’s first year. Will Nintendo have a new 2D or 3D Mario ready for launch?
Beyond franchises, perhaps the most exciting thing yet to be revealed is the Switch 2’s equivalent ofWii Sports,Nintendo Land, and1-2-Switch— a game or games that will show what the new system is capable of and what differentiates it from the original Switch.
Which third parties will show up for Switch 2? And how strongly? Both Microsoft and Ubisoft seem ready to step in and support Switch 2 with a long line of AAA games that couldn’t fit on a Switch, but seem like a perfect fit for Switch 2.
Microsoft has publicly voiced interest in Switch 2, meaning franchises like Halo, Call of Duty, Forza, and Fallout could make a strong showing on Nintendo’s new console. If Microsoft does fully embrace Switch 2, it could be a windfall not just for the Xbox maker, but for Nintendo fans, who will have a big, broad range of very good franchises to play on their new systems.
Ubisoft is a longtime supporter of Nintendo consoles out of the gate, and it has a back catalog of Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy games from the past decade it could repackage for the new and more powerful Nintendo handheld. Other publishers like Sega, Capcom, and Electronic Arts could follow with remasters and rereleases. Suffice it to say, AAA game makers have a potentially big new revenue stream with Switch 2, and I expect owners of the new system to be flush with choice.
That smorgasbord also includes indie games. Nintendo has shown strong support for independent game developers during the Switch era, with dedicated Indie World showcases, which I expect will continue on Switch 2. Are Switch indie devs like Team Cherry and Supergiant Games ready to drop their long-awaited sequels on Switch 2?
A late spring/early summer release for Switch 2 is looking more and more likely, based on the timing of Nintendo’s hands-on events for the console and Polygon’s own sources. We’ve heard that an early June launch is planned.
If that’s the case, a firm date should be announced at April’s Nintendo Direct. June is just two months away; retailers will need time to get up to speed and customers will need to get pre-orders in for Switch 2’s launch.
A bigger unknown, and one that feels a little fluid at this point, is price. While $399 seems like the sweet spot for Switch 2, a weak yen, fluctuating component costs, and price uncertainty related to tariffs threatened by the Trump administration could have an impact on Nintendo’s pricing decisions. Some analysts arepredicting a potentially higher price— upward of $499 — and if that’s the case, there will be one more question that’s yet to be answered: Will Switch 1 owners pay that much?

"Small print for Virtual Game Cards mentions ‘Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games’
byOli Welsh
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
In the small print ofan explainerabout its newVirtual Game Cardsystem for digital purchases, Nintendo appeared to confirm that some Switch games will get enhanced versions forSwitch 2— or at any rate, versions native to the Switch 2 console.
A footnote to the article reads, “Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system.” The note also implies that the Switch 2 will use the Virtual Game Card system as well, and will be able to exchange Switch 1 games with an original Switch.
The Switch 2 is confirmed to be fully backward compatible with its predecessor’s software, so it will be able to play (almost) any Switch game regardless. But Nintendo’s mention of “Switch 2 Edition games,” as opposed to “Switch 2 exclusive games,” suggests that some Switch games will get cross-gen versions that run natively on Switch 2 rather than through the backward-compatibility layer.
This opens the door to enhanced versions of back-catalog titles, such asThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, as well as upcoming Switch releases likeMetroid Prime 4: Beyond. It’s an expected move that has been made commonplace by the latest generations of PlayStation and Xbox consoles. But it’s still the first indication from Nintendo that it will go down this route for cross-gen releases.
It remains to be seen whether Nintendo will charge extra for Switch 2 Edition games. Sony did so for some PlayStation 5 upgrades of PlayStation 4 titles, while Microsoft elected to offer what it called Xbox Series X Enhanced versions of Xbox One games for free.
How the Switch 2 handles backward compatibility, and any potential performance enhancements for older games, is one of the bigger questions about the system ahead of itsfull reveal on April 2. This fine print answers one of our questions about it, but many more remain.

"What’s in pole position for gaming’s top prize? Let’s make some predictions
byOli Welsh
The 11th Game Awards, scheduled for Dec. 11, will come at the end of a watershed year for gaming that will see the launches ofNintendo Switch 2and (in theory)Grand Theft Auto 6. Both of those releases will likely loom large over theGame of the Yearcompetition at the leading awards ceremony for the game industry — the Oscars of gaming, as it were. But they are not the whole story. Even the first few months of 2025 have seen a number of surprisingly strong GOTY contenders come to light.
The Game Awards’ voting bodyis composed of a wide range of international games media (Polygon included), with a 10% contribution from fan voting. There area number of strong indicatorsfor what will perform well in the Game of the Year category. A high Metacritic rating (preferably over 90) is a must; role-playing games and action-adventures are strongly favored, as are games with strong narrative elements; indie and multiplayer games struggle harder for recognition than AAA single-player adventures. We used these metrics to correctly predict last year’s winner,Astro Bot. (We also got four of the six nominees right, and correctly called 14 other categories.)
Below, you’ll find our predictions for the most likely nominees, of which there are six each year, for Game of the Year 2025. Unlike the film industry, where most titles are known quantities well in advance, you never really know what kind of impact a video game will have, or how good it will be, until it’s out. With that in mind, this list only includes games that are already out. We’ll update these rankings throughout the year as new games are released. We’ll also list some likely upcoming contenders, and in future updates, we’ll predict some of the 2025 GOTY race’s dark horses, too.
Why it could win:Critical consensus is still the most reliable indicator of success at The Game Awards, and as the only game released so far this year with a rating over 90 on both Metacritic and OpenCritic, Hazelight’s co-op adventure is the clear front-runner in this regard. It’s got a legacy advantage, too: Hazelight’s previous game,It Takes Two, won GOTY in 2021, and since then has amassed amassive popular following. As a story-led action-adventure,Split Fictionalso belongs to a genre that the Game Awards jury has been known to favor in the past.
Weaknesses:PerhapsIt Takes Two’s win will count against it if jury members are looking for something different to reward. Also, whileIt Takes Two’s intensely personal story about divorce was unquestionably a strength,Split Fictionhas been praised more for its design than its abstract and overworked tale of writers adrift in virtual reality.
Why it could win:This could bethis year’sBlack Myth: Wukong: an ambitious hit game from a developer operating outside the gaming establishment, delivering on core gamers’ ardent desire for massive solo adventures made without compromise.Deliverance 2is a realistic medieval RPG with strong storytelling, and critics really liked it (its Metascore is 88). Another similar game might be the 2015 GOTY winner,The Witcher 3. This is right in The Game Awards’ sweet spot.
Weaknesses:Black Myth: Wukongdidn’t win GOTY— much to its producer’s chagrin. Just likeBlack Myth’s Game Science, Kingdom Come developer Warhorse is considered politically radioactive by some, after founder Daniel Vávra madepro-Gamergate commentsin 2015. Perhaps more to the point, the game is a challenging time sink that isn’t that broadly played among journalists and jurors, despite respectable sales.
Why it could win:Monster Hunter’s steady climb from co-op curio, through handheld sensation, to AAA champion climaxed with the huge sales and glowing reviews ofWilds. It’s slick, it’s gorgeous, and it’s sanded off Monster Hunter’s rough edges. (As a rule, the Game Awards jury isn’t keen on rough edges.)
Weaknesses:AlthoughWildsgestures toward a more conventional RPG storytelling style than previous Monster Hunters, this is still a deeply systemic game in which the equipment grind matters way more than players’ personal investment in the characters, and that’s not The Game Awards’ favorite look for a GOTY winner.
Why it could win:It only missed the deadline for the 2024 awards by a week or two, but MachineGames’ take on the indelible movie hero was swiftly acclaimed for all the things the jury likes to see: strong, performance-led storytelling, polished tech, high production values, a good mix of action and more cerebral play, and Troy Baker. It would almost certainly have been nominated for a GOTY 2024, and April’s PlayStation 5 release will be a big help in keepingGreat Circlein the conversation all the way up until the 2025 nomination process begins.
Weaknesses:PS5 release notwithstanding, 12 months is anawfullylong time to stay relevant in the race. The Game Awards do not typically reward licensed games. And the mid-80s Metacritic and OpenCritic scores are good, but indicate the critical consensus on this game is a little softer than it first appeared.
Why it could win:Obsidian Games’ traditional fantasy RPG is an interesting case. Its initial critical reception was on the soft side, but it has had a long tail and strong word of mouth, as players found its dependable, old-fashioned qualities — satisfying combat, excellent writing, and moreish loot — tough to turn away from. Genre-wise, as an undemanding and strongly narrative-focused RPG, it’s in a Game Awards sweet spot.Avowedis definitely undervalued, and though it will probably get pushed out of the likely nominees over the course of the year, it’s the definition of a dark horse.
Weaknesses:It would be very, very surprising for a game with a mere 80 Metascore to get nominated for Game of the Year. Surprising, but not unprecedented:Black Myth: Wukongmanaged it with an 81 Metascorelast year.
Why it could win:It might not be enough to save Ubisoft, but the whole gaming community heaved a sigh of relief when the first major Assassin’s Creed in four and a half years turned out to be good. This is AAA open-world gaming done right, with lavish production values and memorable characters.
Weaknesses:For whatever reason, the Game Awards jury is not that keen on Assassin’s Creed. 2018’sOdysseyis the only game in the series to score a Game of the Year nomination, and though it was nominated in four categories, it won none. Perhaps, like Call of Duty, the series’ heavily commercialized ubiquity is seen as a disqualifier by the judges.Shadows’ 81 Metascore is certainly too low to buck that trend.
Grant Theft Auto 6:It’s been such a long time since there was a mainline Grand Theft Auto game that The Game Awards weren’t around whenGTA 5was released. It’shard to see anything beating Rockstar’s behemoth— if, and it’s a big if, it makes its 2025 release date.
Metroid Prime 4: Beyond:Nintendo may well have multiple GOTY contenders in Switch 2’s release year, but the only one we know about for sure is Retro Studios’ very long-awaited return to the first-person sci-fi adventures of Samus.
Hades 2:Assuming it emerges from early access this year, Supergiant’s roguelike sequel will likely be leading the indie contenders for the year — out to avenge the original game’s perceived snub at the 2020 awards. (It’s eligible regardless, but the jury prefers not to nominate early access games.)
Death Stranding 2:Hideo Kojima is a Game Awards favorite and the originalDeath Strandingcontended strongly in 2019, although it ultimately lost toSekiro.Death Strandingwas divisive at the time, but in the years since, multiple rereleases have helped players get their heads around this singular vision, and with PlayStation’s full muscle behind it, the sequel is sure to make a big splash.
Ghost of Yōtei:No publisher has a better record at the Game Awards than Sony, and its other contender this year is this open-world samurai adventure — again, a sequel to a game (Ghost of Tsushima) whose reputation has only grown over time. If nothing else, this more rarefied, bespoke-feeling release will probably edge out the similarly themedAssassin’s Creed Shadows.
South of Midnight:The Game Awards jury is sure to love the culturally specific, character-forward storytelling of Compulsion Games’ occult adventure in the Deep South, which likely stands in for a delayedFable(and potentially replacesIndiana Jones) as Xbox Game Studios’ most likely contender. But its gameplay is an unknown quantity, and Compulsion’s record is a little patchy.

"Can’t get hit if you move faster than everyone else
byTyler Colp
Assassin’s Creed Shadowshas a weapon that breaks the whole idea of being a ninja, and thus the entire point of the game. With it, you can turn Naoe into an unkillable brawler that would make Yasuke hang up his sword. It’s so powerful that I’m pretty sure Ubisoft will remove it in a patch, so you should take advantage of it as soon as you can.
The best part? You can grab this weapon in Izumi Settsu, the region that the game starts you off in (shout-out to YouTube userJorRaptorfor highlighting it). A little north of your hideout, there’s a small camp called Tozuku’s Lair. The viewpoint in the Katano Foothills is nearby if you already have that unlocked. The camp has a few enemies to clear out first, and then you can loot the chest for a legendarytantocalled Igan Sunset.
Don’t worry about the stats on the Igan Sunset; just look at that legendary perk engraved on it. Whenever you use the unique Escape Strike tanto ability, time will slow to a crawl. It might not sound very useful, but trust me when I say it might ruin the game for you.
To use the Escape Strike ability, you need to unlock it on the tanto skill tree. The problem is that it’s only available on the second tier of unlocks, which requires you to gather up enoughknowledge pointsfirst. Hit up the orange icons (often hidden behind white question marks) on your map to collect these. I’d aim for simple ones like Shrines, Temples, and Kofun to save yourself some time. When you have enough, use twomastery pointsto unlock Leap Strike, and one mastery point to unlock Escape Strike.
Congratulations: You’re now effectively immortal! When you enter combat with your tanto out, you can hold R1 or R2 (right bumper or right trigger on Xbox) and press circle (B on Xbox) to dodge backward and trigger slow-mo. If an enemy tries to attack you, you can simply step out of the way and do another Escape Strike. And because you can also Leap Strike — which requires the same button combination while you hold your analog stick in a direction — you can freely ping-pong between enemies until they’re dead.
I’m pretty sure that if the Assassins knew about this technique, their long war with the Templars would’ve been over quick. Be warned, though: Those cursed with this knowledge will find it really hard to patiently sneak around as Naoe when they know they can’t be touched in a fight. I haven’t finished the game, but I have yet to find anything that can actually hurt me during battle. Just be sure toupgrade your hideout’s Forgeso you can engrave the Igan Sunset’s perk onto better tantos.
This is the kind of tactic I’d probably recommend avoiding until you’re ready to fully trivialize the whole game, or if you really like playing Yasuke as the primary brawler of the two. Part of the fun of playing Naoe is methodically clearing out a camp until only the big enemies remain and you can pounce on them from the shadows. I’ve only brought out the tanto when things have gone awry, but I won’t judge you for wanting to speed up Naoe’s revenge story with a little time magic.

"Personalized picks from Polygon to you

With so many games available at our fingertips — or in our backlogs — it’s sometimes hard to know what games are worth our time. Figuring out where to spend our precious free time can feel daunting, especially with more things vying for our attention. And if you’re busy with jobs, family, or other obligations, that free time shrinks even more.
But Polygon is here to help. Well, actually, this week I’m here to help. During our weekly open thread, everyone is welcome to comment to ask for tailored game recommendations. Want a long game to escape into this spring? Or some way to test out a new genre you’re interested in exploring? Or a game perfect for chatting while playing on Discord? I’ll do my best to make recommendations no matter what you throw at me — and I’m sure other commenters will too.
How will this work? From 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. EDT, I’ll be in the comments responding to anyone looking for game recommendations. If you’re looking for one, please share as much info about what you’re looking for as you can, including about what platforms you own or if you have a subscription service likeXbox Game Pass.
But there are a lot of games out there, and while I’ve dabbled in many genres, I’ll narrow the field down a little. I play a lot of multiplayer games, both cooperative and competitive. I have a shameful amount of hours banked inLeague of Legends,Overwatch, andMarvel Rivals. I also enjoy exploring vast worlds with my friends, whether that be through a multiplayer match ofStellaris, a rollicking round ofSea of Thieves, or the long-term effort of aValheimserver.
When I’m not feeling particularly social, I also enjoy a wealth of single-player games. They fit into two categories: huge, sprawling RPGs likeCyberpunk 2077orKingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and I also love weird little horror games and indie experiences that you can knock out in an hour or two likeArctic Eggs,The Beginner’s Guide, orI Am Your Beast.
Three bonus ingredients that will spice a game up for me are (1) a robust dolly dress-up system, (2) deep lore, and (3) weird humor.
So, what would you like to play next? Leave a comment below and I’ll do my best to find your next favorite game.

"From House Flipper 2 to Crime Scene Cleaner, these are the best of the best
byMaddy Myers
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Spring is here, and that means it’s time for spring cleaning! No, I’m not referring to my actual home, which I guess I’m also going to clean at some point, but we aren’t going to discuss that today. I am referring, of course, to the far more soothing experience of cleaning up a virtual space in a video game. There’s just nothing quite like the sensation of moving a mop icon on top of a digital dirt pile and clicking, clicking, clicking until it all disappears. If real-life mopping were that satisfying and simple, maybe I would actually do it (instead I own thisrobot mop, which isgreat, but again, that’s not why we’re here).
You might not know it, given how often I talk aboutmy love ofElden Ringorparrying inDark Souls, but cleaning games are one of my favorite video game genres — the perfect counterpoint to a tough FromSoftware title, if I may say so. Also the perfect end to a tiring real-life day! The five games on this list have seriously soothed my brain, and now I pass them on to all of you.
Where to play:PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Windows PCDespite the title,House Flipper 2(and its predecessor,House Flipper) is not so much about flipping properties for resale as it is about doing miscellaneous cleanup jobs in a small town. Beyond brief email correspondence and cellphone calls with your boss, you never really need to interact with anybody in-game; you just go to various locations and use different cleaning implements and power tools to make total shitheaps into sparkling-clean, move-in-ready living spaces. You earn digital currency as you go, so you can unlock more tools to work even faster, but take it slow — every mission is a meditative experience worth treasuring.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Windows PCThe title of this game makes it sound like you might be some sort of official crime scene cleaner for a police department, but nope. You’re playing as a civilian who needs cash badly to help his sick daughter with expensive medical treatments, and you end up working for the mob to clean up crimes. It’s lucrative, OK? Despite the grisly title and dark premise,Crime Scene Cleaneris absolutely a comedy game, with the protagonist constantly delivering sarcastic one-liners about his predicament. Plus, the crimes requiring cleanup have often unfolded in bizarre and fun locations to explore, such as a museum filled with dinosaurs’ remains… and now, human ones.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Mac, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox OneAt first,Unpackingseems like a charming little experience in which you do the titular activity that no one enjoys doing in real life but that feels strangely satisfying in this game, perhaps due to the cute interior designs and animation style on display. Over time, though, you’ll realize there’s a story here of a specific person moving from place to place and living an entire life, reflected in the things they need to unpack at each one. The result is poignant and sweet.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Mac, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XDepending on what type of brain you have,A Little to the Left’s cleaning-oriented puzzles will either leave you frustrated or extremely satisfied… or both. This game isn’t so much about clicking on messes to make them disappear; instead it’s a series of hyper-specific object-based puzzles, most of which involve simply straightening things up. Others are more like aesthetic mind games that require you to figure out an ideal orientation for a certain set of objects (should they be ordered by size, by color, by shape…?). I couldn’t always tell what each puzzle required me to do, but for most of them, it was obvious enough and gave me the nice brain buzz when I figured it out. You can skip any puzzle you get stuck on, thank goodness.
Where to play:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XThe cleaning game to beat all cleaning games,PowerWash Simulatoris also an incredible advertisement for power washers, which are actually as fun in real life as they are in this game. Real life doesn’t have the fun crossovers that this game does, though, where you get to clean up Lara Croft’s messy mansion or Shrek’s swamp. More and more DLC packs keep on getting released, soPowerWash Simis truly the gift that keeps on giving for fans of this genre.

"And you thought Lebron James in Multiversus was the wildest fighting games could get
byIan Walker
They actually did it. After teasinga mysterious collaborationwith Cristiano Ronaldo last year, SNK has announced the soccer player will be, not just a skin or promotional spokesperson, but a playable character in the upcomingFatal Fury: City of the Wolves. The fighting game launches in April.
Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of history’s greatest – and most controversial, due to multiple rape accusations made against him over the years — soccer players, both at the club level on teams like Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus, and internationally with the Portugal national football team. While odd on paper, his appearance inFatal Fury: City of the Wolvescan likely be attributed to his popularity in Saudi Arabia playing for the Al-Nassr football club since 2023, as SNK is currently owned by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s non-profit MiSK Foundation.
Ronaldo has also been known in recent years for arape allegationthat was first made public in 2017 when German website Der Spiegel published asettlementbetween the soccer player and an accuser who claimed Ronaldo raped her in Las Vegas in 2009. Ronaldo reportedly paid the woman a sum of $375,000 for signing a non-disclosure agreement.
The victim filed a civil lawsuit against Ronaldo in Nevada in 2018, charging the athlete’s team with violating the previous confidentiality agreement by denying the allegations publicly following the Der Spiegel report and requesting $25 million in damages. Her case wasdismissedin 2022 due to “bad-faith conduct” by her attorney, and a subsequent appeal wasdeniedthe following year.
Fatal Fury: City of the Wolvesis the first new entry in the pre-King of Fighters series in almost 25 years. Other playable characters include Andy Bogard, Mai Shiranui, and Joe Higashi as well as crossover appearances from Street Fighter cast members Chun-Li and Ken Masters. It launches on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on April 24.

Tucked in amongst a lot of dry business talk about sales milestones and long-term perspectives, CD Projektrecently confirmedto investorsThe Witcher 4won’t be released by 2026, pushing its potential launch window into the unimaginably far-off year of 2027 and beyond.
“Even though we do not plan to releaseThe Witcher 4by the end of 2026, we are still driven by this financial goal,” CD Projekt chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz said, referring to the company’s stated ambitions of pulling in a net profit of 2 billion złoty (around $515 million USD) from 2023 to 2026.
The Witcher 4wasfirst revealedsans release date atThe Game Awards 2024. A lengthy cinematic trailer depicted side characterCiri taking over as the series’ playable protagonistin place of long-time series face Geralt of Rivia.
“We’re kicking off a brand-new Witcher saga, this time with Ciri as the heart of the story!” game directorSebastian Kalemba said at the time. “It feels so good to finally be able to say those words — for the longest time we knew that we wanted Ciri to be the protagonist ofThe Witcher 4; it just felt natural to us and we believe that Ciri deserves it. In this game we want to explore what it means to truly become a witcher by following Ciri on her Path. This trailer is a taste of both that, and just how dark and grounded the world of The Witcher can be.”
The first entry ina new trilogy,The Witcher 4is one of three Witcher projects currently in development, a group that also includes a remake of the franchise’s 2007 debut and a multiplayer-inclusive project codenamed Sirius at Boston-based subsidiary The Molasses Flood.
Rumors indicate Microsoft is alsotargeting 2027for its follow-up to the Xbox Series X/S, which means fans may have to wait for a whole new console generation to roll around to get their hands on the long-awaited Witcher sequel.

"Hell, it’s about time

StarCraft, the classic real-time strategy game created by Blizzard Entertainment, is being turned into a miniatures game. Polish game publisher and plastics manufacturer Archon Studio madethe announcementearly Wednesday morning in a blog post, pegging the initial release for 2026. A series of board games set in the same universe is said to follow in 2027. More information is expected in a livestream presentation on April 3.
Originally released in 1998,StarCrafttells the story of the unending battle between the gritty Terran military, the high-tech Protoss, and the unrelenting hordes of the Zerg. Its outsized success cast the die for a generation of real-time strategy hits, and even helped to popularize the concept of esports. The game lives on, including on Xbox Game Pass for PC which includes access to bothStarCraft: RemasteredandStarCraft 2Campaign Collection.
Archon Studio burst onto the tabletop scene in 2019 with a successful campaign for hard-plastic terrain for dungeon crawling, tabletop role-play, and other applications. CalledDungeons & Lasers, the campaign raised the flag for what was at the time Europe’s only high-level competitor to Games Workshop, the tabletop juggernaut based in the United Kingdom. The studio has gone on to forge partnerships across the video game industry, producing successful campaigns for games likeWolfenstein: The Board GameandMaster of Orion: Ad Astra. It’s also turning heads with its remarkable pre-painted plastic products calledPrismacast, bits of plastic kit delivered on the sprue that look unlike anything we’ve seen on the market so far.
Nothing was revealed about the nature or the scale of the game itself. Archon Studio has scheduled a livestream for April 3 where more information will be provided.

"﻿If I have to buy another fucking Joy-Con, I’m going to scream
byCharlie Hall
Halfway through October 2021, my youngest daughter, just 7 years old at the time, came to me with concern in her eyes. TheNintendo Switchwouldn’t turn on, and its last few moments of operation were concerning. Something about a download that had just completed, she said, and a button that said “update.” That was the end of the line for that particular unit, but only the beginning of my troubles with a console that would proceed to try my patience until this very day — an experience that makes me loath to considerbuying the Nintendo Switch 2.
The Hall family had been victim to a technical snafu as old as mobile devices themselves: the dreaded low-power firmware update. That’s when a device, like an iPhone or a graphics card or a $250 red-and-black plastic hunk of shit, loses power while it’s upgrading its most important layer of software. Firmware refers to the pieces of code that tell a device that it’s a device and not a 398-gram brick, and as I took the tripartite console from my daughter’s tiny little hands — where it was cradled like a dead bird — I knew that it was a total loss. But that wasn’t the worst part.
Inside that black mirror of despair were dozens of tiny, furry neighbors — herdigital friends fromAnimal Crossing: New Horizons. The newisland backupfeature had only recently been introduced, and her idiot father hadn’t yet taken the time to perform the arcane rites required to save a Nintendo Switch game to the cloud.
Her friends were all dead, of that I was sure. So, too, was the bell-selling knickknack shop that she and her older sister had built from scratch before showing it off on the Polygon Twitch channel. My house, my wife’s house, thosedamnable ladders and bridges that took weeks to build, and, of course, the peach trees that we all loved so much… none of them were ever coming back.
Ultimately, it’s my fault. I’m the user here, and it was my error. But I get to beangry at Nintendofor not making something like backing up hundreds of hours of irretrievable gameplay, shared joyfully during the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, just a little bit easier, or — dare I say it — a feature that gets turned on automatically from the start.
Everything about the Switch is a quirk, and some of them are more obnoxious than others
But Nintendo doesn’t treat the cloud like other console manufacturers do. It doesn’t treat online storefronts like other console manufacturers do, either. Or onboard storage. Or game cartridges. Or online multiplayer. Or friends lists. Or televisions, for that matter. Everything about the Switch is a quirk, and some of them are more obnoxious than others.
While having our original Nintendo Switch replaced by a refurbished one set me back pert near $120, I’ve easily spent at least that much buying additional controllers over the years. Both of the Joy-Cons that shipped with our original Switch suffered fromJoy-Con drift, something that my children suffered through wordlessly for months before I realized it.
“What is happening to Mario?” I asked one day while watching the girls play in the basement.
“Oh, that’s just how the controllers work now,” said my oldest. I was incredulous. There is no scenario where I would accept anything other than absolute obeisance from a human input device, but here my kids were making do, trying to complete nefarious jumping puzzles with a joystick that was barely capable of walking a virtual avatar in a straight line. Suffice it to say that they eventually lost the taste for piloting the tiny red plumber — especially when it took the better part of two months to get our controllers back after being repaired under the warranty.
When the next two broke, I just threw them away. It wasn’t even worth a trip to the post office for me.
Today we’re in a better place, thanks. The girls both have healthy relationships with video game consoles like the Xbox Series X, with iPhones and iPads, and with Windows PCs, as well as a catalog of games that each of them can call home. But they remain literally afraid of the Nintendo Switch, a console that let them down multiple times for various reasons. I can’t even coax them to bring it along for road trips.
They won’t forget that experience, and I won’t either. And that’s why I’m waving off the Nintendo Switch 2. I’ve got enough to worry about in the year of our lord 2025 that risking a visitation from another wonky portable console isn’t even on my radar.

"Secret Door’s digital tabletop game is almost here
byMichael McWhertor
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Sunderfolk, the ambitious co-op tactical adventure game built on a love of tabletop games, is coming to consoles and PC on April 23, developer Secret Door and publisher Dreamhaven announced Tuesday. Curious players can try outSunderfolkwith a first look demo through Nvidia’s GeForce Now game-streaming service from March 25 through April 7.
Secret Door’s debut title is inspired by tabletop games likeGloomhavenand Dungeons & Dragons, and uses smart devices as a controller, à la Jackbox games.Sunderfolkis designed to be played by one to four players on a large TV screen or monitor, with the game itself running on a PC or console. Players interact with the game throughSunderfolk’s dedicated controller app, which will be free to download for Android and iOS devices.
Sunderfolk’s creators hope their game will bring players together by bypassing the complexity and setup times required for learning new tabletop games. “Our goal withSunderfolkis to leverage modern technology tomake game night something everyone can enjoy,” said Chris Sigaty, studio head of Secret Door and veteran of StarCraft and Warcraft game development.
InSunderfolk, players choose from one of six anthropomorphic heroes: an Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, or Rogue. Each character has their own strategic role and passive ability, and can be customized with weapons, armor, trinkets, and skills. Character abilities are represented by cards; players personalize their deck of skill cards as they progress through the adventure to create a well-rounded party. It is an incredibly fun and easy game to get into, and a great social experience, based on myhands-on time withSunderfolk.
Sunderfolkwill be available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Steam), and Xbox Series X on April 23. The game costs $49.99.
In addition toSunderfolk’s release date announcement, Dreamhaven and internal studio Moonshot Games also revealed a new project,Wildgate, a crew-based first-person shooter with ship combat.
Dreamhaven also announced Tuesday that it will publish competitive auto battlerMechabellum, which is currently available on Steam. Dreamhaven and developer Game River launched a Premium Edition ofMechabellumon Tuesday, which includes 18 exclusive skins, unique avatars, and special emoticons, for $29.99.
Finally, Dreamhaven announced that developer FuzzyBot’s action-RPGLynked: Banner of the Sparkwill exit Early Access on Steam with the 1.0 release of the game on May 22.Lynked: Banner of the Sparkwill be available on PS5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X for $24.99.

"Wildgate is something new from former StarCraft 2 and Hearthstone vets
byMichael McWhertor
Developer Moonshot Games, which is part ofthe studio founded by former Blizzard Entertainment CEO Mike Morhaime, revealed its long-in-development debut game on Tuesday. It’s callWildgate, which its creators describe as “a crew-based first-person shooter.” That description seems to be underselling Moonshot Games’ ambitions for the multiplayer action game.
Wildgate, likeSecret Door’sSunderfolk, is actually a complex but compelling mix of genres. It’s a blend of team-based, first-person shooter gameplay, resource gathering, ship-to-ship combat tactics, subterfuge, and extraction, all of which combine into something that looks intriguingly chaotic and unpredictable.
InWildgate, players take on the role of Prospectors who plunder for space wreckage in pursuit of a McGuffin called the Artifact. Winning requires either escaping from the anomaly known as the Reach through the titular Wildgate, or by eliminating all the other Prospectors you’re playing against. There appears to a wide range of tactics at play. Prospectors can send out probes to survey the Reach in search of treasure and hazards; go on mining and loot expeditions; invade opponents’ ships to sabotage them; and engage in nail-biting ship battles during escape attempts.
There will be a variety of Prospectors, each with their own abilities and tools, and a range of ships to choose from. The Reach is procedurally generated for every game ofWildgate, which should help keep the action fresh every time.
“Wildgatewas designed for anyone that’s ever wanted to go on a daring space adventure alongside a fearless crew,” said Jason Chayes, studio head of Moonshot Games, in a news release forWildgate’s announcement. “Players are invited to work together and confront evolving cosmic threats – whether they’re mysterious hazards of the Reach – or presented by rival Prospectors. We’re counting on you to bring your best-laid plans… and hey, even if they don’t pan out for the win, we’ve found that some of our favorite experiences are the ones we least expect.”
A preview playtest forWildgatewill be available April 10-14, Moonshot and Dreamhaven, the sister studio to Secret Door, announced. The full game is expected to launch sometime in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Steam), and Xbox Series X.
“Wildgate rewards cooperation and tactical mastery in a way that realizes Dreamhaven’s goal to bring players together and help them create lasting memories,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and co-founder of Dreamhaven, in a statement. “Since every match of Wildgate plays differently, there’s tons for you and your friends to discover as you explore the Typhon Reach. Ship-vs-ship combat brings an element of chaos that makes for an especially fun time, and we’re looking forward to players experiencing it for themselves during the playtest.”
Dreamhaven was founded in 2020 by Morhaime two years after the veteran game developerleft Blizzard Entertainment after more than 27 years with the company. Moonshot is led by producer Jason Chayes (Hearthstone,StarCraft 2), designer Dustin Browder (StarCraft 2,Heroes of the Storm), and artist Ben Thompson (Hearthstone,World of Warcrafttrading card game).

Movie theaters: Who needs ’em? If you’ve already got even a decent TV in your house, you may be looking to augment your home theater setup with a 4K Blu-ray player, which will unlock a markedly better viewing experience than streaming movies from Netflix. In that case, look no further than thePanasonic DP-UB820, which is once again on sale at Amazon as part of the company’sBig Spring Sale. It’s down to $387.35, representing a discount of 22% (or more than $100) off the near-$500 regular price.
The price has actually been hovering around this level for most of March, and this has become a semi-regular deal on what I consider to be the best option for physical media playback. Now, you don’t have to spend $400-$500 on a dedicated 4K Blu-ray player; cheaper ones are available, and you could also use a multipurpose device that happens to support 4K discs, like a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. But this higher-end model is one of the few disc players that’s compatible with all of the HDR formats you could possibly want: Dolby Vision and HDR10+ (neither of which is supported by game consoles for disc playback) as well as HDR10 and hybrid log-gamma.
That’s the main benefit of the UB820 over lower-tier 4K Blu-ray players likePanasonic’s own UB420, but it’s a big one. Even if your current TV isn’t compatible with Dolby Vision — Samsung doesn’t support the format at all, for instance — you might want to get this player so you’ll be set when you upgrade at some point in the future. Plus, it has Wi-Fi built in (unlike cheaper Ethernet-only models), and in the event you’re not using a soundbar or a home theater receiver paired with speakers, it sports analog outputs for 7.1-channel audio. I’ve owned a UB820 for a number of years, and I love the thing: On top of delivering a top-tier playback experience, the device is built to last, whereas most lower-end players on the market feel flimsy. If you’re serious about making the most of your4K Blu-ray collection, this is the way to go.

"The sequel to one of our favorite third-party controllers is on sale for the first time
byAlice Jovanée
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
You won’t want to miss the inaugural discount on the 8Bitdo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller atAmazon. Priced at $59.99 at launch back in February, you can pick up the Ultimate 2 for just $47.99 duringAmazon’s Big Spring Sale. Thanks to its relatively low price point and extensive features, the original 8Bitdo Ultimate controller quickly established itself as one of our favorite third-party controllers, and the sequel builds on that legacy.
The Ultimate 2 is aesthetically similar to the original with its Xbox-style layout, but has two new inputs next to the shoulder buttons in addition to the back paddles found on the original. The triggers have also been improved with better Hall-effect sensors, which allow you to fine-tune the travel distance via the 8Bitdo Ultimate app. However, the biggest addition to this controller are six-axis motion controls, a rare feature in third-party controllers.
The joysticks now feature an RGB light ring, but have also been improved with new tunneling magneto-resistance sensors, which are more accurate and power-efficient than the Hall-effect sensors found in the original controller.
The Ultimate 2 doesn’t have Bluetooth connectivity, but is compatible for wireless use with Windows and Android devices thanks to its 2.4 GHz dongle. And, just like the original controller, the Ultimate 2 also comes packaged with a dedicated charging stand, this time with RGB lighting built into the base.

"The console’s key games tell the story of a changing Nintendo
byOli WelshandMichael McWhertor
What games do you think of when you think of Nintendo’s Switch? There are several obvious answers; Nintendo’s in-house studios never fail to leave their mark on a system with a handful of brilliant games. Yet one of the most notable things about the Switch, as it prepares to cede the limelight toSwitch 2after eight years on the market, is that it has been less software-dependent than, perhaps, any Nintendo console since the NES.
Of course the Switch wouldn’t be the success it has been without its biggest games. In its first year,The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandMario Kart 8 Deluxehelped the console find a massive audience. Yet both started as games for Wii U, Nintendo’sleastsuccessful platform. The Switch really was a case of a console that carved out a space for itself by arriving with the right form factor at the right time. The games that worked well on it found a console that was uniquely capable of adapting itself to suit them and helping them find players, rather than the other way around.
The Switch began a new era for Nintendo as a platform holder that began to look a little more like the others, even if it continued to play by its own rules. The games that defined the console aren’t necessarilythe bestor the biggest. Shockingly, they don’t include a mainline Mario platform game. They’re the games that described what the Switch meant to players, and how it changed Nintendo — and the rest of the game industry.
Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ unprecedented success on Switch was a mixed blessing. It was in no small part a blockbuster hit due to the devastating worldwide pandemic that forced us indoors and into isolation around its release.New Horizonsgave many of its players a taste of connection and community when they couldn’t physically meet up with friends, family, and colleagues.
ButNew Horizonswas more than just a digital alternative to real-world socializing. It was a place where we made new virtual friends, found comfort in routine, and exercised control over our lives, albeit imaginary ones lived on our own private islands. The coziness of Animal Crossing was a refuge during a difficult stretch.
That’s not to say thatNew Horizonswasn’t an enjoyable evolution of the Animal Crossing experience on its own merits. It was. There was joy to be found in building and customizing a home — and even in paying it off — and exploiting the game’s quirks to amass riches. Millions of us delighted in daily interactions with Isabelle, Blathers, and the Nook boys, and waited with anticipation as new villagers visited our town, praying that we’d pull a “dreamy.” It was a brief taste of video game monoculture, fueled by the state of the world, and a defining moment in the Switch’s success. —Michael McWhertor
Breath of the Wildhas become so inextricably linked with the Switch that it’s easy to forget it was also released on Wii U, and in fact was announced as a Wii U game before we even knew what the Switch was. Nintendo’s decision to pivot it to a cross-gen release gifted the Switch what might be the greatest launch title of all time.
Beyond that, it marked a creative turning point for Nintendo as a game developer, and sent a clear message that the Switch was ushering in a new era for the company. The game’s bold, nonlinear, systemic design was a huge departure for the Zelda series, synthesizing many influences from beyond Nintendo’s Miyamoto-worshipping bubble into something that was distinctive and original, but also felt like it had been made in a world whereSkyrimandMinecrafthad happened. The sequel,Tears of the Kingdom, took things even further by giving players an astonishing, almost game-breaking level of creative freedom.
Breath of the Wildturned one of Nintendo’s oldest franchises into its most modern. It also outsold every mainline Mario game on the Switch, a first for the Zelda series. It was quite clear that Nintendo would never be the same again. —Oli Welsh
Switch was a platform for second chances. Many of Nintendo’s games that failed to break through on the poorly selling Wii U found new life on Switch, including the Splatoon franchise,Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, andCaptain Toad: Treasure Tracker. But none of those ports and rereleases have enjoyed the incredible success ofMario Kart 8 Deluxe, a souped-up version of the 2014 kart racer that has since gone on to outsell its predecessor eight times over.
Mario Kart 8 DeluxeistheSwitch game; two out of every five Switch owners have a copy. It was so successful for Nintendo that, five years afterDeluxelaunched, the company released 48 more courses and eight additional characters as DLC. In an equally important move, Nintendo included that DLC as part of its Nintendo Switch Online subscription, part of the company’s plan to offer more than just multiplayer connectivity and classic games.
It’s telling that the first game Nintendo has shown for Switch 2 is a new Mario Kart.Deluxenot only brought in all-new fans of the Mario Kart franchise, it helped get the storied franchise back on, ahem, track. —MM
Let’s be honest; the Switch is not the ideal platform to playThe Witcher 3. Nintendo’s console is manifestly underpowered for a game that was cutting-edge in 2015 and remained a technical showpiece when Nintendo’s console launched two years later. At the time, Nintendo was also not a natural home for such bloody, sexy, world-weary fare.
This is precisely why the Switch port ofThe Witcher 3is so important. It’s significant that anyone tried to make it, and incredible thatthey pulled it off. Nintendo had long left the world of AAA gaming behind, and even during the success of the Wii, big publishers tended not to bring their marquee titles over because they were too technically demanding or aimed at a perceived different market. When the Wii U flopped, many third parties deserted Nintendo altogether.
The Switch, however, was not just a huge sales success — with its appealing form factor and the undeniableBreath of the Wild, it had thrust Nintendo back into the hearts of the core gaming community. All of a sudden, third parties were clamoring to be part of it, and a few studios began to specialize in cramming AAA titles onto Switch’s aging mobile chipset and into the tight confines of its game cards. A wave of “miracle” ports began with2016’sDoom, and of these, the 2019 port ofThe Witcher 3was the white whale. Not long after, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X widened the technical gulf again to a point where the ports would start to dry up — but you can expect the floodgates to reopen on Switch 2. —OW
“Everyone is here!” Nintendo promised withSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate. The game maker not only kept that promise, it overdelivered with one of the most impressive expansions to any Nintendo franchise ever. In addition to stacking the game’s core roster with 69 playable characters, including every fighter who’d ever appeared in a Smash Bros. game and surprising newcomers like Castlevania’s Simon and Metroid’s Ridley, the game’s developers pulled off what felt like impossible licensing deals. Banjo and Kazooie. Kingdom Hearts’ Sora.Final Fantasy 7’s Sephiroth.Minecraft’s Steve and Alex.
The massive growth of the Switch and the fervor for more Super Smash Bros. seemed to feed off of each other. Led by tireless game makerMasahiro Sakurai, the yearslong development ofSuper Smash Bros. Ultimateresulted in the series’ biggest entry yet, so gargantuan that one has to question if Nintendo and Sakurai can ever top it.
And whileSuper Smash Bros. Ultimatewas a major step forward for the franchise,Nintendo’s approach to esportsand its games being featured at non-Nintendo-sanctioned events hasn’t evolved much during the Switch era. —MM
Who would have seen Labo coming? Nintendo’s DIY “build-and-play” line of accessories let Switch owners craft cardboard “Toy-Con” versions of real-world items like a 13-key piano, fishing rod, and motorbike — and evena VR headset— for an all-new play experience that evoked the wild accessories released during the Wii era.
In retrospect, it’s almost shocking that Nintendo Labo arrived just 13 months after the release of the Switch. What now feels like a late-life cycle attempt to reinvigorate the Switch with a gimmick was just another moment of unexpected innovation from Nintendo.
While interest in Labo died out fairly quickly (building the Toy-Cons was 90% of the fun), it was a reminder of the uniqueness and adaptability of the Switch Joy-Cons to act as more than just conveniently detachable controllers — an idea that Nintendo would later explore with the similarly creative and unexpectedRing Fit Adventure. —MM
It might seem strange to chooseScarletandVioletto represent Pokémon on this list. Of the Switch’s mainline Pokémon titles,SwordandShieldwere better received by fans and even sold better (by a hair’s breadth). But it’s precisely because of theirperformance woesanduninspired designthatScarletandVioletare, sadly, more symptomatic of the Switch era.
The runaway success of the Switch always represented a risk that Nintendo might rush too keenly to capitalize, letting its famous quality control standards slip in the process. As far as its internal studios were concerned, iron discipline was maintained, but Nintendo didn’t have as much success in keeping its partners at The Pokémon Company and developer Game Freak in check.
The Switch saw 12 Pokémon games released in six years, including four (soon to be five) major Game Freak titles; the developer releasedScarletandVioletand the superiorPokémon Legends: Arceusin thesame year. It was just too much, andScarletandVioletbore the signs of an exhausted studio trapped in a content grind. You really can have too much of a good thing. —OW
Pairing the greatest video game of all time with the hot genre of the moment forTetris 99felt both like a uniquely classic Nintendo move and surprisingly forward-thinking for the company. While other game makers chased variations on the battle royale shooter, Nintendo and developer Arika took a different approach, resulting in a frenetically fun, all-ages take on what is traditionally a violent genre.
Shadow-dropped as a bonus perk for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in 2019, the release ofTetris 99brought fresh buzz to the Switch. Its success spawned even more variations on the battle royale formula from Nintendo, withSuper Mario Bros. 35andF-Zero 99. (Arika also created a99-player battle royale version of Pac-Manfor Bandai Namco.)
Tetris 99’s most lasting impact, however, may be its role as a value add for NSO subscribers. Nintendo, having already mined most of its back catalog from the NES and SNES era forNintendo Switch Online’s classic games offerings, will need more games likeTetris 99to keep Switch 2 owners interested and subscribed to the service. —MM
The Switch era has run parallel with a surge in interest in Japanese-made RPGs, and it’s very much not a coincidence. Japanese publishers and developers naturally flooded to the console, which had huge sales in their home market, at the same time as the overseasanime boomcreated just the right cultural environment for these games to have an international moment. Nintendo saw the opportunity and lent a hand, often shining a light on Japanese-made games in its Direct broadcasts, and occasionally stepping in to co-publish games like Square Enix’s gorgeous throwbackOctopath Traveler.
Nintendo was well placed to benefit from this snowball effect with some of its own games, including the Xenoblade Chronicles series. But the ultimate example was 2019’sFire Emblem: Three Houses. Intelligent Systems’ tactical RPG series had always been beloved within its specific niche, but the audience the Switch had amassed for anime-flavored RPGs turned it into something bigger — a sort of viral hit, powered by players’ obsession over the game’s characters and relationships and its Harry Potter-style system of rival school houses.Three Housesshowed how the Switch was, and remains, one of the most fandom-friendly platforms around. —OW
While major third parties took a little longer to turn their oil tankers in Nintendo’s direction, the indie developer scene saw the potential of Nintendo’s machine almost instantly and rushed to take advantage. For several years, it was common for indies to release their hits on Steam and Switch first, and worry about PlayStation and Xbox later. The Switch’s humble tech was no barrier to these games, and the immediacy of their designs often suited portable play perfectly.
The two games that most symbolize the Switch’s indie era are 2018’sHollow Knightand 2020’sHades— both fantastically refined action games in popular genres that are tricky to get right (Metroidvania and roguelike, respectively). Both found huge audiences, thanks in part to the Switch’s enormous reach. Of the two, it’s probably Team Cherry’sHollow Knightthat is more closely associated with the Switch — if only because its long, long-awaited sequelSilksongwas first announced at a Nintendo Direct, and the increasingly desperate anticipation of new info about the game ahead of every Direct since has become a meme. —OW

Palworlddeveloper Pocketpair has one word on its mind, and it’s “beefy.”
During a conversation withIGNat the recently concluded Game Developers Conference, communications director John Buckley saidPalworldwon’t be coming to Switch because the open-world, crafting-focused Pokémon-like is “a beefy game.” A potential Switch 2 release, however, is “worth considering” if Nintendo’s next console is “beefy enough.”
“We haven’t seen [the Switch 2] specs yet,” Buckley said. “Like everyone else, we’re waiting. I’m walking around GDC hoping someone will tell me, but everyone I’ve spoken to says they haven’t even seen them. We did a lot of optimization for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with. Still work to do, but we’re really happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible.”
Palworldmadeheadlinesleading up to its January 2024 release due to its uncanny similarities with the Pokémon franchise both in monster designs and gameplay. The Pokémon Company eventually sued Pocketpair forpatent infringement, prompting an update toPalworld’s summoning mechanicsjust three months later. And while neither studio has said much about the legal proceedings in the months since,PC Gamerreports Buckley briefly addressed the controversy during his GDC talk.
“We did legal checks beforePalworldreleased and they were all cleared in Japan,” Buckley said. “So obviously when the lawsuit was announced we were like, ‘What?’ Pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge [Pokémon] fan, so it was a very depressing day, everyone heads down and walking in the rain.”

"Please enjoy Troy Baker whipping Nolan North
byMichael McWhertor
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
PlayStation 5 owners will finally get a chance to playIndiana Jones and The Great Circleon April 17, or April 15 in early access, developer MachineGames and publisher Bethesda Softworks confirmed Monday. The announcement comes with a great bit of comedy, as ubiquitous voice actors Nolan North and Troy Baker — whovoices Indy inThe Great Circle— discuss what it means to embody a video game adventurer in a new clip promoting the release date.
North, the famous voice behind the Uncharted series’ Nathan Drake, serves as something of a mentor to Baker in the video, enlightening his younger colleague about the weight of taking on the role of someone like Indiana Jones, or a character Indiana Jones-adjacent. And frankly, I’d like to see more from these caricatures. North’s pompous-ass version of himself is just as fun as Baker’s put-upon rendition.
Anyway, the news here is thatIndiana Jones and The Great Circleis finally coming to PS5 in April, just four months after the game’s release on Windows PC and Xbox Series X. While the official street date forThe Great Circleis April 17, pre-ordering the game will grant early access on PS5 starting April 15. Digital pre-orders are available now, with physical pre-orders opening March 25.
In addition to launching the PS5 version in April, MachineGames is adding two new whip abilities to all versions of the game: Open Season and Sleight of Hand. Open Season will inflict more damage to enemies on subsequent attacks if they’ve been cracked by Indy’s whip, while Sleight of Hand will let players disarm an enemy and cause their weapon to fly Indy’s way.
Indiana Jones and The Great Circleis an original adventure based on the character created by Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford. The story, set between the events ofRaiders of the Lost ArkandThe Last Crusade, sends Indy on a globetrotting mission as he battles Adolf Hitler’s forces, which are chasing artifacts of great power. Jones teams up with an Italian journalist named Gina Lombardi, who has a personal stake in their journey.
The latest game from the developer behind the modern Wolfenstein games was well-received late last year, andcould’ve been a GOTY contenderif not for its December release. OnMetacritic,The Great Circlehas “generally favorable” reviews, and onSteam, a “very positive” reception from players.

"Just a little one. As a treat
byOli Welsh
According toone very annoyed Ubisoft investor, citing a private report by investor service Mergermarket, Ubisoft has been holding secret talks with Microsoft, Electronic Arts, and other publishers who are interested in acquiring some of the troubled publisher’s franchises.
This is interesting in the context of Ubisoft’s current struggles; the floundering publisher hasn’t had a hit in a while, is losing the confidence of investors, and is “exploring strategic options” that include going private and breaking up the company. Thelatest reportssuggest Ubisoft is looking to create a new entity that will hold on to some core intellectual property. Things are so bad that even a stellar launch forAssassin’s Creed Shadowswon’t necessarily fix it all.
It’s also an interesting prompt for assessing the Ubisoft catalog. What properties does Ubisoft have that are worth buying, but that Ubisoft itself can do without? What can Ubisoft sell without throwing its soul into the bargain?
So, I propose a little thought exercise. You are Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming. You have spent many billions acquiring publishers like Bethesda and Activision Blizzard, and studios like Obsidian and Double Fine, in a seeming attempt to own all of gaming (if not to actually sell Xbox consoles). But you are not quite satiated yet, and the spectacle of a floundering French publisher conducting a yard sale of storied franchises is too tempting to resist. Maybe just a little one? As a treat?
What will you choose? For the purposes of this exercise, we’ll assume that Assassin’s Creed is not for sale; it’s Ubisoft’s flagship, and without it the publisher might as well just close up shop. To a lesser extent, the same goes for Far Cry. And we’ll also assume that all the Tom Clancy games are off the table. It’s true that some parts of the Clancyverse seem ripe for the picking — for example, Splinter Cell, a fondly remembered stealth action series (with strong links to Xbox) that Ubisoft is currently doing nothing with. But it seems unlikely that the Clancy estate would be interested in breaking these properties up — and there’s no way Ubisoft is letting go of Rainbow Six, which is one of its most reliable cash cows.
So, what’s left in the shop window to tempt a browsing Microsoft exec?
Well now. This one is quite tempting, isn’t it? A largely dormant action-adventure franchise, recently revived by a quality Metroidvania, but with a major reboot wallowing in development hell. You never really had anything to match Uncharted with. This could be it, maybe… although corporate might not like the optics of an American giant swooping in to acquire the most famous Middle Eastern gaming icon. Especially in… the current climate.
You never really had a platforming mascot to speak of, but this one is just soprofoundlyFrench it’s impossible to imagine it as a standard-bearer for the greenest, most American game console. Respectfully, it’s a hard pass.
The same ought to apply to Ubisoft’s funny little rabbit guys, but if you squint, they look an awful lot like Minions. And Minions arehugewith kids. Family franchises are a bit of a blind spot for Xbox. On the other hand, the only decent games the Rabbids have ever been in also starred Mario, and Furukawa-san over at Nintendo probably won’t be into it. (You need to call him, though, about putting every single one of your franchises on Switch 2 — it never hurts to ask!)
This is a multiplayer game you’ve never heard of about medieval warriors beating each other up. But there’s a note on the sticker that Ubisoft reckons it has35 million players? That can’t be right. Have your team pull the data on that one. Might be worth it, if it’s cheap. Who doesn’t like swords?
You actuallydohave Forza Horizon at home. So it’s a pass.
Oh man, you remember loving the original one on PlayStation. And didn’t they do that wacky one that was all about a ghost policeman possessing cars? That was cool. You have enough driving games, but this one’s a little bit different, a bit funky. Ask if they’ll throw it in with something else.
[You have a Kinect trauma flashback and curl up in a ball on the floor.]
You didn’t spend $7.5 billion acquiring The Elder Scrolls for nothing. Except, apparently you did, because the next one is never coming out, and Obsidian could probably churn out three Might and Magic games for you by next week. Still though… nah.
Somehow, despite buying half the game industry, you don’t really have any GTA-style open-world games, and to Ubi’s credit, Watch Dogs got quite good; you remember thinking the last one,Legion, was pretty fun. If theyreallywon’t let you have Assassin’s Creed (note to self: up offer by $0.5-1 billion), you could see yourself owning this. But then… it’s not actually GTA or Assassin’s Creed, is it? It’s not even Far Cry.
Nowyou’re talking. A franchise that was maybe never actually popular, but that has ascended into fanboy myth status. A directionless vaporware project that’s been stuck in development hell for somewhere between 10 and 20 years. But you couldsaveit, Phil. Think of the gamer cred! Think how cool your T-shirt reveal would be! It’s just so Xbox. It’s just soyou. Where’s Satya’s company card?

If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
The new game releases this week are a little bizarre. Whether it’s taking a pretty grim concept and putting it into a cute aesthetic or literally stepping into dreams, these games are playing with surrealism. It helps that a lot of them are tied to familiar genres, because the places they go might be a little uncomfortable.
Spilled!is a colorful little game about cleaning up oil and plastic. It looks chill and inviting, but your job is to save the world from all the waste. Over inAtomfall, the world is already gone, ravaged by a nuclear disaster. There are bright green fields warped by irradiated fissures and melted buildings. The nightmares continue inKarma: The Dark World, a horror game where you solve crimes by hopping into the heads of the suspects. And at the end of the week,InZoiarrives with its uncanny characters and hyperrealistic cities. It may be a chill life sim, but it can’t escape feeling a little disturbing with howperfecteverything is.
Here are our most anticipated game releases for the week of March 24.
Release date:March 26Platforms:Mac, Windows PCThis is a game about cleaning up the ocean with your fancy boat. There are oil spills, discard plastic, and fires to take care of in each level, as well as some cute animals to save.
Release date:March 27Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XIt’s that time again — Soulslike time. This game is a mix ofSekiroand other action RPGs, with tense combat and tons of weapons to wield. Unlike a lot of Soulslikes, however, it also has an easy difficulty option that makes it approachable for newcomers to the genre.
Release date:March 27Platforms:PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XWelcome to STALKER in the British countryside. This shooter is about surviving after a nuclear disaster. Everything is scarce all the time, forcing you to weigh your options when confronted with combat and even seemingly friendly NPCs.
Release date:March 27Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PCThis is a sci-fi game with Soulslike combat. You have a huge arsenal of weapons and spells to use against a bunch of otherworldly beasts. Don’t expect slow,Dark Souls-style combat in this one.
Release date:March 27Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis game sounds like a mix of a detective game and a psychological horror game. The world is controlled by a big corporation, and you play as a detective who can step into the minds of suspects. I’m sure nothing scary will happen with that.
Release date:March 28Platforms:Windows PC (early access)Here’s a life sim with a hyperrealistic look. You create a character and then pick a city to live in. From there, it’s your job to customize the city with food trucks and parks to keep everyone happy. The game is launching in early access, so expect a bunch of updates as time goes on.

"Sometimes you need a break from all the randos

If you have an internet connection and the right subscriptions,Monster Hunter Wildsallows you to play in a lobby with a whole bunch of other people online. But sometimes you just want to playoffline single-player.
For some, an online lobby can be super helpful. Stronger players can swoop in and help you defeat tough monsters and give you the support you need. However, that’s not always the experience a hunter wants, and many might prefer to take on each challenge by themselves.
This guide will show you how to play both online and offline single-player inMonster Hunter Wilds.
Before we get into all the ways to play offline, there is technically a way you can stay “online” but continue the game in a single-player.
To do so, go and find Alma, the character who manages the quest counter. (Finding her shouldn’t be too hard since she accompanies you almost everywhere in between assignments — however, you can also find her in any basecamp. She often sits by your tent in at each basecamp.)
Talk to her to access the Quest Counter and tab over to the “Change Lobby Menu” page. Once there, select the option, “Online Single Player” the setting will alter the game so you continue your adventure in single-player. If you play in this mode, other players will only be able to join you for the duration of the quest you’re on. (If you don’t fire an SOS flare, you will never see another player in this mode.)
For more information on how to play with other people, check out our onlinemultiplayerguide.
There is one sure way to make sure you playMonster Hunter Wildsoffline:Disconnect your console or PC from the internet.
If you’re using a PC, you can either unplug your ethernet cable or turn Wi-Fi off under “Network & Internet” in the system settings. But here’s how to do so on consoles.

I Hate This Place, the 2022 horror series from writer Kyle Starks and artist Artyom Toplin, wasone of my favorite comicsthat year. And now, as revealed in the Future Games Show, it’s a neon-colored isometric open-world survival horror game that I’ll probably be too chicken to play.
I Hate This Place— originally announced asFuck This Place, which is a way better title, but, like, I get it — starred Gabby and Trudy, a lesbian couple who see the cattle ranch they just inherited as their ticket to financial stability. Unfortunately, the family ranch is secretly a locus for every horror genre simultaneously: hauntings, alien abductions, a Strange Entity in the Forest, Secret Knife Killer Hiding Among You, the Place Won’t Let You Leave, Survivalist Cult Apocalypse, and so on.I Hate This Placewas kind of like… “Fast Car” meetsThe Cabin in the Woods.
The new game adaptation is being developed by Bloober Team (2019’sBlair Witch,The Medium), under the company’s new horror imprint Broken Mirror Games, and appears to focus on an original story set in the comic’s titular Place, potentially a prequel. “Players take on the role of Elena, whose fight for survival begins when she unwittingly awakens a malevolent force,” says a joint news release from Bloober Team andI Hate This Place(the comic)’s Skybound Entertainment. The game will feature “retro ‘80s comic book aesthetics,” where the original comic was set in the modern day.
“Each location is lovingly crafted to tell its own disturbing story through stylish visuals that blur the line between reality and nightmare in a world where everything wants you dead.” According to the news release, gameplay will feature “tense gunfights and melee combat that rewards ingenuity over brute force, all while crafting essential tools to survive the harsh and unforgiving wilderness long enough to reach safehouses before nightfall, with the day & night cycle having an impact on gameplay dynamics.”
I Hate This Placeis currently set to launch in Q4 of 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch. It’s available to wishlist onSteamand theEpic Games Store, and you could pick up the comic that inspired it onAmazon,Bookshop, or at your local store.

"A leaked image suggests Steam is coming to the Xbox PC app — and maybe consoles, too
byOli Welsh
Microsoft seems intent on tearing down the norms of game-industry competition between platforms. Not content with publishingprecious first-party games on rival consoles, it now looks as though Xbox is ready to link arms with the leading PC gaming platform, Steam.
The Verge reportsthat Microsoft briefly published an image on Thursday depicting a new, cross-device user interface for Xbox. A filter for “Steam” is clearly visible in the view of a user’s game library shown in the image.
The image was published in a blog titled “Opening a Billion Doors with Xbox” about Microsoft’s currentplatform-agnostic strategy. (Sample quote: “Our goal is simple: to make every screen in the world an Xbox.”) The image was apparently quickly removed by Microsoft after The Verge inquired about it.
The publication of the image seems to have been a mistake. Does it really indicate that Steam integration is coming to Xbox? And, in a world where every screen is an Xbox, what does that mean exactly?
It’s certainly not outlandish that Microsoft might seek to make users’ Steam libraries visible within the Xbox PC app in this way. The Verge’s sources said that Microsoft plans to make every game installed on a PC visible within the Xbox app, and other PC game launchers, like GOG, do this.
But there’s also a real chance that Microsoft is thinking of expanding Steam integration beyond desktop PCs. The image shows the new Xbox UI running on multiple devices: a laptop, a phone, a tablet, and an Asus ROG Ally handheld, as well as a TV. Xbox consoles are also pictured. This is consistent with Microsoft’s announced strategy tocombine Windows and Xbox experiencesin a new, unified UI that will reportedly feature on anXbox-branded PC handheld from a partner manufactureras early as this year.
Could Steam integration come to future Xbox consoles as well as desktop and handheld PCs? It’s far from fanciful to suggest it. Xbox chiefPhil Spencer told Polygon last yearthat he thinks console platforms should be more open, like PCs, and that he’s open to putting rival storefronts like the Epic Games Store — or, it follows, Steam — on Xbox consoles.
Windows Centralrefers to persistent rumors of a partnership between Microsoft and Valve to put Steam on the next generation of Xbox consoles — rumors that Polygon has also heard (but not verified). The next-gen Xbox consoles — a dedicated handheld, and a successor to the Xbox Series X — aresaid to be more PC-like devices, running on a Windows-based development environment.
Considering all that, it’s surprisingly easy to picture Steam as an integral part of Xbox in future. This latest image is likely a mock-up, and its publication was surely an unintended slip. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a sign of things to come.

"Bloober Team’s Cronos: The New Dawn looks scary good
byMichael McWhertor
After Bloober Team’s excellentSilent Hill 2remake, I’m willing to give the developer the benefit of the doubt when it comes to its brand of horror games. It certainly helps that its next effort,Cronos: The New Dawn, looks incredible and is giving off goryDead Spacevibes.
Cronos: The New Dawnco-directors Wojciech Piejko and Jacek Zięba make their inspirations pretty explicit in a new look at the sci-fi survival horror game.Cronosdraws on John Carpenter’sThe Thing, German TV seriesDark, and Terry Gilliam’s12 Monkeysfor inspiration, the duo say, as well as games likeDead SpaceandDark Souls.Cronosshares some familiar attributes fromDead Space, including terrifying human mutations as enemies, an over-the-shoulder shooting perspective, and a limb-severing mechanic — though Piejko says Bloober Team is taking a different approach to dismemberment than Visceral Games did.
In a follow-up to acinematic reveal trailer forCronos: The New Dawnreleased last October, Piejko and Zięba showed off some gameplay in a new dev diary Bloober Team released Thursday. The pair explain how protagonist the Traveller, who they liken to a deep-sea diver who plunges into the depths of time, is sent into the ruins of human civilization to extract survivors. The alternate-reality world ofCronoshas been ravaged by an event called the Change, which in the game’s fiction, destroyed our world in the 1980s.
Piejko and Zięba previously worked on Bloober Team’sObserverandThe Medium, so they have plenty of experience with sci-fi and psychological horror.Cronos: The New Dawnis an original property for Bloober, which is also working on a follow-up with Konami.
Cronos: The New Dawnis coming to PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X sometime in 2025. It’s a welcome new entry in the AAA sci-fi survival horror space, especially since theDead Spaceremake team is now working on the next Battlefield and EA’s Iron Man game.

"Quite the sticky situation we got ourselves here
byToussaint Egan
Remedy Entertainment is no stranger to unconventional ballistics. The Finnish game developer is well known for its eclectic, boundary-pushing approach to third-person shooters with titles such asMax Payne,Alan Wake,Quantum Break, andControl. But a co-op first-person shooter where you fight, among other threats, a sentient swarm of Post-it notes? That’s a new one.
On Thursday at Future Games Show, Remedy debuted a new trailer forFBC: Firebreak, the studio’s upcoming first-person shooter set in theRemedy Connected Universe. Taking place six years after the events of 2019’sControl, the game centers on Firebreak, a team of volunteer “first responders” who act as the first and last line of defense between the remaining members of the Federal Bureau of Control and the Hiss, the hostile supernatural resonance that’s possessed their former co-workers. FBC’s Firebreak team finds itself trapped inside the extradimensional office building known as the Oldest House, with the Hiss trapped alongside them, waiting to attack.
The trailer, titled “Paper Chase,” shows a three-player team working together to clear out an infestation of malevolent sticky notes that have overtaken the executive sector of the Oldest House, along with a swath of Hiss-possessed FBC employees. Using improvised weapons and tools including what appears to be an electrified pneumatic jump firearm, a high-pressure water cannon to blast away sticky notes obscuring a player’s field of vision, and an explosiveObject of Powerresembling a piggy bank, players move between various containment zones and safe rooms collecting ammo and items.
The trailer culminates with players fighting against a group of anthropomorphic masses of sticky notes before facing off against a massive monster referred to simply as “Sticky Ricky.” It’s impressive, exciting, and unabashedly bonkers.
Polygon attended a virtual press event on March 11 where Remedy showed off an extended playthrough of the mission featured in the trailer, as well as a presentation on the game’s core pillars led byFBC: Firebreakgame director Mike Kayatta.
“From day one, we asked ourselves this question over and over again anytime we had an idea we wanted to pitch out to the others in the team: Could this happen only inControl, and could this happen only at Remedy? Is this something that only us weirdos on the team were willing to put into a game with the Remedy label on it, and if the answer was yes, then we thought we were on the right track,” Kayatta said.
At its core,FBC: Firebreakis designed to prioritize pick-up-and-play potential, ditching the engagement stress of daily check-ins, monthly grinds, and battle passes that bifurcate experiences between casual and hardcore gamers. “However much you’ve played or your friends have played, no matter how good you are versus how good they are, it doesn’t matter,” said Kayatta. “We want to have some way of playing this game with anyone who wants to play it with us, and we’ll give you a lot of options to kind of create that experience.”
Those options boil down to three major factors at the outset of the game. The first are “jobs,”FBC: Firebreak’s in-game terminology for missions that players can choose to tackle. Each job is set in one of the sectors of the Oldest House with its own unique objective. The second is “Threat & Clearance Level,” which are essentially modifiers that players can select before embarking on a job that determines the combat difficulty (Threat) and the number of combat zones from one to three (Clearance). The Threat & Clearance Level you choose can afford for greater challenges and the possibility of greater rewards. Finally, there are Crisis Kits — weapon and skill loadouts that give players the ability to emphasize one of three unique play styles that players can switch between mid-job.
In addition to all these options, players can also collect and equip Research Perks that entail different abilities that modify your skills, à laControl’s Personal Mods, and become stronger when paired with perks of the same type. The result, in theory at least, is an interoperable core experience that emphasizes teamwork, creativity, and moment-to-moment spontaneity.
When prompted as to whether or not players would have to playControlin order to fully understand or enjoyFBC: Firebreak, Kayatta emphasized that Remedy’s 2019 action-adventure game is intended to be complementary to this new game, not compulsory. “It’s really important to us to kind of protect two groups of players with this game. One are theControlpeople. We don’t want you to feel as though you have to divert into a genre you don’t feel comfortable with to follow the story of these characters and to understand what happened. We also want to protect non-Controlplayers by making sure that they don’t need to have that backstory to fully understand anybody that we present them with.”
All post-launch downloadable content, such as new jobs, will be free for allFBC: Firebreakowners, with optional cosmetic items available to purchase. Cross-play will be supported, allowing those who own the game to play with one another regardless of whether they own the game on console or PC. While Kayatta and co. were cagey about the exact details of what Remedy has in mind for the game’s post-launch content map, it’s likely thatFBC: Firebreakwill at some point in the future bridge the gap between the events of 2019’sControland the upcomingControl 2, which is currently in production.
As a longtime fan of the studio, I’m impressed with what I’ve seen of the game so far and eager to dive back into the paranatural shenanigans of the Remedy Connected Universe whenFBC: Firebreaklaunches on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X this summer.

"The System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Edition comes to PC and consoles June 26
byAlice Jovanée
System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Edition(formerly titledSystem Shock 2: Enhanced Edition) will be arriving on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch on June 26, courtesy of Nightdive Studios. Announced at the Future Game Show Spring Showcase, the25th Anniversary Editionbrings a fresh coat of paint to the classic 1999 sci-fi horror game and will be the first classic System Shock title playable on consoles.
This effort isn’t nearly as extensive as the excellentSystem Shockfrom 2023, butSystem Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Editionstill features a massive graphics overhaul with updated textures and ultrawide support, in addition to new audio recordings and a litany of quality-of-life improvements to make the game more palatable for modern audiences. Nightdive took a similar approach to its Enhanced Edition of the originalSystem Shock, turning the previously obtuse title into what many consider the ideal way to play the 1994 game.
Over the past 25 years,System Shock 2has received aremarkable amount of community supportin the form of patches, higher-resolution textures, and other fixes. These mods offer an excellent version ofSystem Shock 2, but the process of getting everything running properly makes the experience relatively hostile to new players. The25th Anniversary Editionintegrates many of these improvements while optimizing aspects ofSystem Shock 2that haven’t been touched since 1999.System Shock 2is one of my favorite games of all time, and I’m excited for a new generation of players to experience the maiden voyage of the Von Braun when the game comes out in June.

"OK, technically it’s a remaster of old content — but it’s obscure old content
bySusana Polo
MystandRivendeveloper Cyan Worlds surprised fans of its three-decades-old-and-counting game franchise this week by dropping an entire new world you can explore for free into its most recent remaster of 1993’sMyst. The setting, Rime, is new toMyst(2020), though not to the franchise as a whole — it was originally designed 25 years ago, for Cyan’s first attempt at building a 3D version of the classic 2D puzzle game.
Cyan teased the addition Friday on X, witha cryptic postcomprised of code and an imitation broken .jpg image. But no alternate-reality game mechanic is safe from Cyan’s puzzle-hounding fanbase, and several clues corresponding to Rime’s 2000 gameplay were quickly uncovered. The developerconfirmed those suspicions on Tuesday.
Rime was not included in the original development ofMystin the 1990s, but was added as an extra explorable world with the release ofRealMyst: Interactive 3D Editionin 2000. The snowy setting expanded on the broader plot of the later Myst franchise, building more of a narrative bridge toRiventhan its creators had been capable of whenMystwas the beginning and end of the story.RealMystwas ported into Unity in 2014, with Rime intact, but when Cyan set about remasteringMystfor the high resolution and VR displays of the 2020s, the extra world fell by the wayside for the game’s Unreal Engine/VR compatible remaster in 2020.
The Rime update forMyst(2020) is now available to anyone who owns the game on PC, Mac, or Meta Quest, with updates for Xbox One and Xbox Series X coming soon, according to Cyan’s news release. The update is free on all platforms. And while Rime is a remastered throwback, Cyan also promises that the update includes “all-new narrative beats, lore and visuals.”
“A NEW AGE (with new surprises)!” said Cyan’s X postconfirming Rime’s return. And it should take about… five minutes for the Myst fandom to sleuth out all those surprises, if we had to estimate.

The standalone prequel toThe New Order,Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,is currently free for Amazon Prime subscribers through April 21.

All you need to add the game to your library is a validAmazon Prime subscription, and unlike Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, you won’t lose access if you stop being a member.
Wolfenstein: The Old Bloodis only the most recent addition to the catalog of titles available to Prime members for free.

"A Switch 2 sports announcement
byMichael McWhertor
Get ready to see a lot of Nintendo logos this summer, especially if you’re a fan of Major League Baseball. The Seattle Mariners announced Thursday that they’ve partnered with Nintendo as the team’s “first-ever official jersey sleeve partner.” That means that the Nintendo logo and theNintendo Switch 2logo will be featured on Mariners players’ sleeves, starting March 27.
Nintendo’s “racetrack” logo will appear on Mariners’ home jerseys, while the (much beefier) Switch 2 logo will appear on the team’s away jerseys. According to the Mariners, that will make the Seattle-based team the first in the MLB to feature different marks for home and away games.
“Nintendo and the Mariners have been inextricably linked since 1992,” Seattle Mariners president of business operations Kevin Martinez said in a statement. Martinez is referring to when Redmond, Wash.-based Nintendo of America purchased the Mariners in the early ’90s. (Nintendo sold its stake in the team in 2016.) “Now, each time the Mariners take the field, our jersey sleeves will help serve as a reminder of all that Nintendo of America has done for the Northwest community and the team.”
Logos of video game companies appearing on U.S.-based sports teams is incredibly rare. While gaming brands are commonplace in sports racing circles andin European football leagues, Seattle is something of an exception. Another local team, Seattle Sounders FC, featured an Xbox logo on its jerseys from 2009 to 2016.
Advertisements on MLB jerseys were all-but forbidden before before 2022. The league’s 2022-2027 collective bargaining agreement allows for a small shoulder patch with a corporate logo or image on one sleeve of players’ uniforms and batting helmets.
You can see the Seattle Mariners’ new Nintendo branding next week, when the team hosts the Athletics on opening day.
Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to launch sometime this summer. More details will be revealed in aNintendo Direct dedicated on Switch 2on April 2.

"The influential industry event names its GOTY picks

While the scale of December’s The Game Awards has given the trailer-heavy show the glow of the gaming industry’s Oscar equivalent, the annual Game Developers Choice Awards and Independent Game Festival Awards, held together each year at GDC, are closer to an Academy Awards-like event.

"Playground Games’ series offers some spectacular virtual sightseeing
byOli Welsh
What’s better than the idea of a road trip? It’s one of the most romantic and liberating forms of travel — combining go-anywhere freedom with the ability to quickly cover large distances and drink in the landscape as you travel. In the real world, though, clogged roads and energy efficiency concerns can dent your enjoyment; motor touring isn’t quite what it was in its mid-20th-century heyday.
Fortunately, we have a great virtual alternative. The Forza Horizon series of racing games is set in huge open-world maps based on stunning, real-world tourist destinations: Colorado, the Mediterranean coast, Australia, the British mainland, and Mexico. Each game compresses some of its chosen area’s most iconic scenery into one artfully rearranged map, studded with towns, sweeping freeways, and winding mountain roads. The artists and technicians at Playground Games have made sure it all looks absolutely gorgeous, too. The result is some of the best virtual tourism you’ll find.
This week on Polygon, we’re looking at games that feel like vacations for your brain in a package we’re callingRetreat Week.
Below, I’ve mapped out some of my favorite sightseeing tours from across all five Forza Horizon games. Sadly, due to the car and music licensing issues that beset so many racing games, all butForza Horizon 5have been delisted from sale. But they’re all backward compatible on Xbox Series X, so if you already own them, or can pick up physical copies, they’re still eminently playable, and all recommended. To make things easy, the routes all use the in-game GPS.
Some driving tips for your scenic tours: Remember, it’s not a race! You don’t need to use your fastest car — in fact, something from a slower class is probably preferable, so you have time to take in the scenery and won’t need to be so focused on not crashing. Choose a car with an engine that sounds good to you, go easy on the accelerator, and consider using manual transmission and shifting up early to keep the revs low and chill. Camera is a matter of personal preference, but if you use a third-person rather than in-car view, you can use the right stick to smoothly pan around and check out the view as you cruise. Tune in your favorite radio station — or turn it off entirely — and enjoy.
The first Forza Horizon game, from 2012, is set on a relatively compact map, inspired by the U.S. state of Colorado, yet it still has a real sense of scale as it sweeps from the red-rock canyons of the Southwest through open plains and autumnal woodlands to the drama of the Rockies. Whether you play it on Xbox 360 or in 4K on Xbox Series X, this is a beautiful-looking game with scenery worth drinking in.
Route 1: Downtown Carson to Red Rock Observatory
Start at the North Carson Horizon Outpost, then set a route to the Horizon Outpost in Red Rock Heights in the southwest corner of the map. This quintessentially American road trip takes you through a modern downtown then out onto the plains, with a view of the main Horizon Festival site to the east. Then you make a spectacular, winding climb up past russet-hued spires and cliffs of rock, and are rewarded at the end with a breathtaking view over the whole map toward the Rockies.
Route 2: Gladstone Creek to Finley Dam
Start at the Gladstone Creek Horizon Outpost, then set a route to the Rockstar Cliff Run race on the far eastern edge of the map. This mountain route cuts through a dramatically deep gorge, through a tall pine forest, and past a stunning waterfall, with an impressive, snow-capped peak towering over you all the way. It finishes by cutting down to a dam clearly inspired by the real-life Hoover Dam — a monumental slab of curved concrete backed by a glassy reservoir.
Recommended rides:I used my 1957 Ferrari 250 California for these drives, but if you want to honor the American auto industry, how about the 1970 Ford Mustang Boss 429?
While it still takes some pretty big geographical liberties, the second game’s map — which takes in a small corner of southeastern France and northwestern Italy — is designed with a little more specificity and realism than the others. As a consequence, it’s not the most varied or spectacular location in the series, but it makes up for that with a gorgeously evocative rendition of the area’s glamorous Mediterranean coastline and rustic landscape, dotted with historic medieval towns.
Route 1: Nice to Castelletto
Start at the Nice Masséna festival hub and set a route for the Il Tricolore Aereo event in the southeastern corner of the map. This istheclassic Mediterranean coast drive, starting in the chic metropolis of Nice and then winding under vertiginous cliffs, with a romantic sea view to the right, all the way to the charming port town Castelletto. Continue a little way past the event start point for a stunning view over the bay.
Route 2: San Giovanni to Tenuta Montellino
Fast travel to the San Giovanni festival hub and set a route to the lakeside castle of Tenuta Montellino, not far to the northeast. Take a minute to explore the cobbled streets of the medieval walled town of San Giovanni before you set off for the castle. On the way, you’ll take in a sweeping view over vineyards and rows of cypress trees, with the rugged Maritime Alps spread out in a petrol-blue haze on the horizon.
Recommended rides:For opening-of-TheItalian Jobvibes, it’s got to be the 1967 Lamborghini Miura. But if you want something a little less slippery in the bends on the winding coast road, a 1992 Lancia Delta HF Integrale won’t go wrong.
This is perhaps Playground Games’ most fanciful map, cramming in every conceivable biome from Australia’s vast landmass: Outback wilderness, subtropical rainforest, winemaking valleys, and surfing coastline. It’s pretty spectacular, and it’s also very off-road-friendly, so feel free to wander off the beaten track as you explore. Handily for our purposes,Forza Horizon 3also introduces Beauty Spots that highlight some of the game’s best views.
Route 1: Surfers Paradise to the Twelve Apostles
Start from the Surfers Paradise festival hub and set a route to the Ocean View Trail race starting line in the southeast. This is a straightforward bomb down the east coast with some dramatic off-road beach driving. It starts in a glassy, Melbourne-inspired cityscape, cuts through the rusting hulks of the Silver Sands Shipwrecks, takes in a stretch of the Great Ocean Road, and ends with a drive through the towering coastal rock formations of the Twelve Apostles. Carry on to the end of the beach and turn up to the Apostles Cliff Danger Sign for a great view back along the coast.
Route 2: Glass House Mountain to Ormiston Gorge
Start at the Glass House Mountain Beauty Spot, south of the center of the map, and set a route for the Ormiston Gorge Beauty Spot in the far north. You set off into the heart of the Maroondah rainforest, with its towering trees; as you emerge from the forest, be sure to check over your right shoulder for a great view of the blunt mass of the Glass House peak. Then you swoop down through farmland into the parched, rust-hued Outback, splashing through shallow riverbeds on your way to the deep gorge.
Recommended rides:An off-road vehicle is a good idea, and captures the rugged spirit of the map. The humble 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor, America’s workhorse, is a great pick. Alternatively, for local color, you can’t beat the 1974 Holden Sandman HQ Panel Van (with surfboard roof rack, of course).
Playground Games is on its home turf with this U.K. map, and it might be the studio’s greatest achievement. Balancing the spectacle of3with the authenticity of2, it’s a gorgeously romantic evocation of the British mainland. In its surprisingly accurate rendition of Edinburgh, it also has the best cityscape in the series by far.
Route 1: Glenfinnan Viaduct to Arthur’s Seat
Start from the Glen Rannoch Trail event in the northwest and set a route to the Holyrood Park Drift Zone over in the northeast part of the map. This stunning Scottish tour takes you under the Glenfinnan Viaduct, through stark Highland scenery, and down into Edinburgh, where you’ll blast past Edinburgh Castle and the Scott Monument before heading down the Royal Mile and up onto the rocky hillsides of Arthur’s Seat. If your car is up to it, go off-road at the end and climb up for a beautiful view over the city and the Firth of Forth.
Route 2: Broadway to Bamburgh Castle
Fast travel to the starting line for The Colossus on the map’s southern edge, and set a route for the Bamburgh Castle player house on the eastern coast. (The GPS will try to take you up the motorway — ignore this and turn right at the roundabout to head up the coast road instead.) This drive somehow takes you from a quaint Cotswold village watched over by an old windmill, through typical English countryside, to an impressive castle on the windswept coast of Northumberland.
Recommended rides:Choose a classic British sports car — this game has loads of them. Perhaps the 1965 Austin-Healey 3000 or 1964 Aston Martin DB5, or, if you really want to ride in aristocratic British style, the gigantic 1931 supercharged Bentley.
Forza Horizon 5’s huge Mexico map, dominated by the high-altitude Gran Caldera volcano, matches3’s Australia for sheer variety and spectacle. There are plenty of astonishing vistas to be found across its landscape of rainforest, sand dunes, scrubland, and verdant hills. And, like4before it, it benefits from the atmospheric seasons that change weekly, bringing monsoons and blazing heat.
Route 1: Gran Telescopio to Dunas Blancas
Fast travel to the starting line for Las Dunas Cross Country, on the summit of La Gran Caldera volcano, and set a route for the Buenas Vistas player house on the map’s western edge. The GPS will send you down the switchbacks, but ignore this and drive over the Event Horizon Danger Sign and down the side of the mountain on a vertiginous but straight track. You can then either follow the new GPS route or, if your car is up to it, just head for the destination marker and power over the dunes. This route takes you through an otherworldly landscape — starting from a stratospheric altitude, with view to match, and through the towering white dunes of Dunas Blancas, ending with a great view of the El Arco de Cabo San Lucas rock formations.
Route 2: Guanajuato to Ek’ Balam
Fast travel to the starting point for the Panorámica Sprint, and set a route for anywhere in Ek’ Balam in the southeast. This tour takes you from the popping pastel colors of the map’s main city, Guanajuato, through a fertile, humid farming region and into the southern rainforests, ending at the ancient ruins of Ek’ Balam, where you can freely explore.
Recommended rides:For the first route, a buggy or rally raid car like the 1969 Volkswagen Baja Bug would be perfect. For the second, why not chill out (and look great against the colors of Guanajuato) behind the wheel of a 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air?

"Nothing is true — except this starter advice
byAri Notis
Make no mistake:Assassin’s Creed Shadowsis an Assassin’s Creed game to its core. You probably have a general idea of what to expect. Sneaking past bad guys. Stabbing bad guys. Climbing tall structures and elegantly diving into hay bales that happen to be next to some bad guys (who you then stab).
Still, thanks to its massive scope,Assassin’s Creed Shadowshas so many moving parts even the most stalwart series fan can get tripped up.
Below, we’ve collected 33beginner’s tips forAssassins’s Creed Shadows.
1.Before you start:Immersive modeis actually really cool. Rather than one language track, you’ll hear characters speak in their natural tongue (Japanese, Portuguese, English, and so on).
2.Love Assassin’s Creed stories and lore? In that case, before you start, turn oncanon mode, which removes dialogue options. (But if you just want a solid RPG, you can ignore it.)
3.Assassin’s Creed Shadowscan be very visually dark — especially in caves and at nighttime. The screenshot below, for what it’s worth, is unaltered. We recommend turning the brightness up a few notches.
4.Assassin’s Creed Shadowsstars two protagonists (Naoe and Yasuke), but you won’tunlock Yasukefor a while. Like, areallylong while. Even if you’re rushing through themain story, give yourself at least 10 hours.
5.When you’ve eventually unlocked both characters, use Yasuke for combat and Naoe for stealth. For the most part. Naoe isn’t entirely useless in combat, for what it’s worth — just remember to use her kusarigamaweapon. And Yasuke can technically perform stealth attacks, depending on how you invest in his skill trees.
6.The differences extend to navigation, too. Yasuke can run through walls butcan’twalk on tightropes. Naoe can’t move heavy crates butcangrapple across lengthy gaps. And we implore you: At least once, try to do a leap of faith as Yasuke.
7.You can do most quests as either character. Though if you literally are unable to do a quest as one or the other, the game will tell you (either through a notification or through a character’s spoken dialogue, like, “I bet Yasuke can move these crates”).
8.If you’re not in combat or in a restricted zone, you’ll automatically heal back to full health.
9.But you won’t automatically restore any usedrations(that’s Assassin’s Creed speak for “potions”). Instead, you’ll have to find those at shops or in ration-specific loot boxes.
10.Increasing your total ration capacity isn’t a matter of shopping or upgrading equipment but rather… finding a specific NPC. Who doesn’t show up on your map. Yes. Really.
11.The autosave? Surprisingly good, actually! In our testing,Shadowsseems to autosave every two to three minutes, and logs the five most recent autosaves. Between that and the seemingly limitless number of manual saves (on Xbox Series X, at least), you can really save-scum your way through this game if you’d like.
12.You can recruitcompanionsto fight by your side, and even though they map to ability prompts, they actually stick around in combat for a few moments.
13.Also, there’s technicallyromance, but only for a few characters (that we’ve found so far).
14.If you’re riding a horse or other mount, stick to the roads. The countryside ofShadowsis peppered with steep mountains, and the horse controls are already janky enough on flat terrain — no need to introduce a 45º pitch.
15.Actually, just stick to the roads anyway. You’ll stumble upon more shrines, temples, castles, side quests, Hidden Trails, Kofun, and other optional activities that way. Plus, if you try to run through the woods in a straight line to your destination, your screen is gonna look like this:
16.When you first enter a new province, take the time to unlock a bunch of the synchronization points (the eagle symbols). Those are your fast travel spots, and the more you’ve unlocked, the more time you’ll shave off the back-and-forth travel required for the main questline.
17.You can’t fast travel out of restricted areas like enemy bases, camps, and castles.
18.Synchronization points are considered combat-free zones — even if they’re in the middle of a restricted area — so you can always fast travel to and from them.
19.As soon as you can, get the Ascension Boost skill in Naoe’s Shinobi mastery tree. It dramatically increases Naoe’s climbing speed with the grappling hook, which is the fastest way to unlock new synchronization points.
20.Remember the Assassin’s Creed golden rule: If there’s paint on a wall, that means “CLIMB HERE.”
21.Your level determines your base stats (health, attack, defense, and so on). Your knowledge rank determines what tier of skill points you can unlock in mastery trees. Yourmastery pointsare used to unlock those skills.
22.Spend time hunting down knowledge points to expand how many skills you can unlock. Completing Horse Archery, Kata,Kuji-kiri, andLost Pagesare some of the fastest ways to getknowledge points.
23.But don’t worry too much about mastery points. You’ll get a bunch of them just by leveling up (though if you want more, start by attacking castles).
24.You can automatically transmog all of your gear from the start. And after you come across a weapon or armor set for the first time, it’s unlocked as a customization option permanently. In other words, you don’t need to keep it in your inventory.
25.At the start, sell your loot; don’t break it down. The currency, mon, is more valuable than the upgrade materials you get for dismantling weapons and armor.
26.Don’t bother trying to upgrade gear until you’re at least level 20. You cycle through so much gear in your early levels that anything you upgrade, you’ll likely replace in a few levels anyway.
27.There’s a suggested level for each province, and you should largely follow the provinces in order from lowest level to highest, but don’t worry about out-leveling any activities. Province levels will scale with you.
28.When exploring a Kofun (tomb), light the candles as you go. Not only does it help illuminate the space, maddeningly dim as it is, but it also helps you keep tabs on which tunnels you’ve already explored so you don’t end up going in circles.
29.Liberally use yourscoutsto reveal objectives. Though scouts seem like a limited resource, you can restore them quite effectively as needed.
30.Yes, you can pet the dog:
31.And the cat:
32.But watch out for the kitten!
33.To send you on your way with a note of sincerity, though, it’s this: Do not sleep on the Codex menu. As you exploreShadows, you’ll unlock Codex entries about various aspects of Japanese history. Each one is written up in elaborate detail, with many featuring scanned or photographed artworks from real-world museums. On paper, sure, Assassin’s Creed games might tell stories about stabbing — but the root here is and always has been about stories that actually happened. It’s easy to miss this aspect of the game, buried in a menu as it is, but in this regard,Shadowsis as sharp as Assassin’s Creed has ever been.
Just startingAssassin’s Creed Shadows? Beyond our fullAssassin’s Creed Shadowswalkthrough, here are explainers onhow long to beatthe game and when youunlock Yasuke, plus if you should playcanon,immersive, orguided explorationmodes.

"Valve’s masterpiece still carries the platform on its back
byCameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
New Half-Life games make me do stupid things. WhenHalf-Life 2came out on PC, I trekked to GameStop to trade in my Xbox, controllers, and games. I had hoped to score hundreds in trade-in credit, but the associate discovered my console was soft-modded and quartered the quote as a result — barely enough to cover the game. It didn’t run very well on my parents’ eMachines desktop (as a console player at the time, I didn’t know what recommended specs were). I was very sad when a port of the game eventually came to Xbox.
Half-Life: Alyxlaunched on March 23, 2020, nearly five years ago. I actually had a solid gaming PC that could run it. However, I didn’t have a VR headset, which is a necessary component. I immediatelyhadto have one, ideally a model that wouldn’t leave a $1,000 crater in my checking account likeValve’s Indexwould. I ended up buying a refurbishedOculus Riftfor $250 or so, and over the course of a memorable week, I beatAlyx, then promptly returned the headset for a refund while my jaw was still on the floor from its incredible finale.
It wasn’t long until I bought the wire-freeQuest 2later in 2020, another questionable financial decision, but I kept this one. Then I replayedAlyxthe way that it was meant to be experienced, which is with roomscale movement — no headset-tracking base stations required. I could kneel down, turn around, and just generally feel like I existed in the world, without concerns of tripping over a cable tethering me to my PC.
These hoops were worth jumping through forHalf-Life: Alyx, and those of you who’ve played it would likely agree. I haven’t played a VR game since with as much graphical polish, as much atmosphere, or as much consideration for different play styles and varying levels of comfort with VR mobility. It’s also the best-paced game I’ve played in VR; it’s the only title I’ve wanted to keep playing beyond my “oh, I don’t feel so good” threshold, which is somewhere around the 30-minute mark.
While the end goal of most of its encounters is to shoot bad guys and creatures with guns,Alyxoffers more open-endedness to encounters and to exploration in general. Once you clear a room, you can practice thwipping and throwing items with your gravity gloves, play the piano, or gawk at the stellar quality of theliquid shaders in bottlesbefore you smash them on the ground. You can open cabinets, fridges, and more, stacking each item you pull out realistically on top of the others. Why you would want to do that is beyond me (also, I did this), but the point is that youcoulddo it.Alyxput you in charge of how you spent your time in VR, not the other way around.
It’s trite to say this five years after launch, butHalf-Life: Alyxfelt like a door being kicked open, revealing what’s possible in VR. And, with the backing of one of gaming’s most beloved developers, I considered its release a possible turning point for VR tech going mainstream. I just really wanted everyone to be able to try it.
VR headset adoption has grown exponentially since 2020, thanks to Meta’s somewhat affordable Quest lineup of headsets. ThePlayStation VR 2can now be used on PCs, no longer exclusively tied to the PlayStation 5 (and it’s $200 less than it was at launch,costing $399.99). But since owning a powerful, costly gaming PC is the other part of the equation, that growth hasn’t made it all that much easier for more players to try games likeHalf-Life: Alyx. I wish Valve would port the game to PS5 so PSVR 2 owners could play it there. But since it hasn’t happened yet, more than two years after the headset’s launch, I’m not holding my breath. Maybe Valve is prepping a version of the game for its oft-rumored wire-free VR headset “Deckard” that our pals atThe Vergehave written about. Or maybe it’s not.
While there have been other great VR-only games sinceAlyx(Horizon Call of the Mountain, Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR, Batman: Arkham Shadow, to name a few that swung for the fences), the virtual reality segment has struggled to keep up the pace with new, must-play games. That’s sad, though it makes me treasureHalf-Life: Alyxeven more. It was a huge gamble to release the long-awaited prequel to one of the most influential games in virtual reality, requiring hardware that very few had then, and still very few have today. To that end, every developer making VR games is knowingly making a huge gamble that may not pan out in their favor.
Sure, I wish thatAlyx’s story could be played directly on consoles and PC so that more fans can play the game, but without gravity gloves, that would spoil all of the fun. When or if that’ll ever happen isn’t for us to decide. So, go ahead, do a stupid thing and buy a VR headset just so you can playHalf-Life: Alyx, even if you return it right after (I won’t tell). The game is just$17.99during the Steam Spring Sale, which lasts until March 20.

"The historic setting is fascinating and impressive, and I’m still left wanting more
byGrant Stoner
A shinobi deftly runs across several rooftops after swiftly assassinating several guards. She opens a large castle gate for reinforcements. A hulking samurai walks through, leaving behind a trail of bodies. The two climb up the castle stairs before being greeted by four samurai. They unsheathe their swords, offering me a choice of which character to enter the duel with. Naoe steps forward, her hidden blade extended, ready to meet its target.
Assassin’s Creed Shadowstakes the series through the late Sengoku period of Japan, set roughly between the 1570s and 1600 C.E., during the time in which Oda Nobunaga attempted to unify the nation and Japan saw an increase in Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries. Much like the duality of the historical setting,Shadowsis always playing with multiple themes throughout its story. Revenge, heartbreak, and even a sense of belonging and purpose are present in every mission. The narrative ofShadowsis its best feature, one that kept me engaged throughout my 35-hour play session, and one that will continue to draw me in as I finish the campaign.
Shadowshas players swap between the two main characters — Naoe, the assassin, and Yasuke, the samurai — but only after the first 10 hours or so, when you unlock Yasuke. Naoe’s story sees her coming to terms with her background as a member of the Iga clan, coupled with her understanding of her role in the Brotherhood, the secretive era-traversing assassin guild. Her journeys throughout Japan reflect the vastness of the nation’s cultural and political landscape. She is fierce and deadly, assassinating high-profile samurai while simultaneously learning how to exist beyond the fields of her home.
In one of my favorite missions, Naoe discovered the art of chanoyu, a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Players are required to fetch an ornate gift for the host of the ceremony, memorize proper cup placement when drinking, and even choose a formal kosode to wear. Every decision you make during this mission impacts your conversation with the others at the ceremony, the guests clearly discerning that Naoe is out of her element. She is so singularly focused on her goal of revenge that the intricacies of chanoyu fall to the wayside. And once she locates her target, she shifts out of her disguise and into her shinobi identity.
Yasuke is also quite literally the definition of an outsider. Arriving with the Jesuits, Yasuke quickly gains Nobunaga’s attention because of his race. Both true to the game and the historical figure, Yasuke was the first Black man in Japan, and the only Black man in history to achieve the rank of samurai. And his missions inShadowsreflect the duality of his life as a samurai and a foreigner. During a flashback in the game, Yasuke is sent to study under the same sensei that trained Nobunaga. Three students beat him and mock him for his large size and his inability to properly wield a sword. After training dutifully, he kills the three in a duel, winning the favor of Nobunaga and becoming one of his samurai and trusted advisers. And yet, he is still disrespected by several members of Nobunaga’s council for being an outsider.
Even the world ofShadowsfeeds into the themes of belonging. Naoe is all but ignored as she wanders through cities and villages. People pay no mind to her as she recruits companions to her cause or gathers information on targets. Her sense of place comes from trying to establish a new home with those equally impacted by the plight of war. Yasuke, on the other hand, is feared and revered as he travels. Random villagers will walk up to him and bow, or say his name in excited tones. One of my favorite things to do when discovering a new location was to swap between characters and compare the reactions of townsfolk. It brought the world to life, something that is often missing with protagonists in other Assassin’s Creed games. You’re always meant to be hidden, a nobody. But it’s disappointing to explore these prominent historical settings and not feel like you’re part of these moments.Shadowsrectifies that.
Unfortunately, my adoration withShadowsbegan to falter after the novelty of the story and the initial exploration elements wore off. At its core,Shadowsadheres to the same open-world role-playing game formula we’ve been exposed to sinceAssassin’s Creed Originsin 2017. Main missions and side objectives follow a predictable flow: Go to a general area in a region, locate intel or a person of interest, find and eliminate the target, then rinse and repeat. The gameplay loop is admittedly fun during the first 15 hours, as players are introduced to the differing ways in which Naoe and Yasuke play — Naoe as the traditional stealthy character in every Assassin’s Creed game, and Yasuke as a powerhouse that can overwhelm heavily armored opponents — but that novelty can’t mask the repetitive objectives. Even side storylines, which reveal themselves as you progress through the story and discover new regions, play out the same way as main missions.
I often felt forced to complete side quests just to level up and get better gear because I didn’t want to be underleveled. However, this meant exposing myself to theexactgameplay sequence I just spent hours completing. For example, each castle has a select number of daimyo (samurai) to eliminate before collecting legendary loot. And they look and play exactly the same at every single castle you visit. While some side quests beautifully weave in Japanese history and folklore, like the hunt for yokai (spirits from folklore), there is no deviation in the way they’re completed. The design and development choices feel far more invested in ensuring accurate Japanese historical and cultural representation than in weaving entertaining gameplay throughout. Learning about the culture and time period is definitely a plus, but the setting can only do so much to draw me in before I’m inevitably bored.
Even the exploration of Japan is repetitive. While I loved interacting with the environment and encountering wild animals to paint through sumi-e, finding new sensei to train my skills through kata, and navigating through kofun (tombs) and Hidden Trails, they don’t do enough to level up your character.
Activities like discovering lost scrolls in temples, praying at various shrines, and looting castles are all introduced within the first several hours, and nothing about them changes. If you successfully loot one castle, you’ve essentially looted them all. But because they have legendary gear, precious materials for upgrading your hideout, and large amounts of experience points as rewards, you’re expected to continuously loot them as you progress. This is by far my biggest complaint withShadows. The RPG elements force you to play through repetitive side missions just to level up and complete main missions. It was unique withOrigins, but roughly eight years later, I find myself longing for a traditional, relatively linear Assassin’s Creed game.
These issues are compounded with the game’s perplexing accessibility. Ubisoft is known to regularly champion accessible features and inclusive design practices with its games, andShadowsis no exception. With options like Guaranteed Assassination, audio cues for mechanics like traversal and combat, and Auto Movement,Shadowsis an example of what players have come to expect with modern accessible titles. Even the combat is inclusive through the simplistic and accessible design, allowing me to play for long hours. However, the limitations of customizable controls on Windows PC left me frustrated and physically exhausted.
While it’s possible to customize every input, even stacking actions on the same button or key, the remapped inputs don’t always register, and they occasionally override each other. With my limited reach, I can access approximately nine mouse buttons and keyboard keys. I often require games to let me bind actions to the same key, likeEscape from Tarkovdoes.Shadowsdoestechnicallyenable this, as my grappling hook and assassination are bound to the same key, as well as interact and swap weapons — but no other functions behave this way. I’ve tried combining other inputs to the same keys with little success, and I can’t discern why some combinations work and others don’t.
These difficulties force me to use a virtual keyboard to make up for the lack of available buttons and keys, but even the virtual keyboard doesn’t properly function within the game. With every click, the game registers me attacking first before applying the desired input. For example, pressing H lets me heal, but my character always swings their weapon before the heal is applied. This isn’t necessarily an issue during combat, but can be problematic when I’m trying to remain hidden in the bushes or on top of rooftops. This even affects aspects like changing equipment. You are unable to change equipment when performinganyaction, and to open my inventory, I need to press I with the virtual keyboard. The only way I can successfully change weapons or armor is by being in an area that locks the game out of combat, like in your hideout or on observation platforms. This forces me to either wait for a family member or friend to press the key, continue playing until I reach a new lookout spot, or fast-travel back to my hideout.
The virtual keyboard also impacts the act of summoning my mount. Since I need to click X to call my horse, the game always registers me attacking first. I have yet to properly ride a horseanywhere, forcing me to either fast-travel around the map or run to new locations, which can be thousands of meters away. I’ve added approximately three hours to my overall playtime just from running across the map, since I can’t access my horse. And while you can customize every key, every option I already have is crucial to playing the game, forcing me to leave some functions unavailable without the virtual keyboard.
Assassin’s Creed Shadowsexplores a setting I’ve wanted to explore for years. It’s always made sense to bring the series known for its hidden organizations and ninja-like aesthetics to feudal Japan. And while I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the setting and story, so much so that I will be rolling credits well after launch, it’s marred by open-world RPG mechanics that continue to plague modern Assassin’s Creed games with repetitiveness.

"How is your backlog holding up?
byIan Walker
We’re halfway through March, which means Xbox Game Pass is about to addanother heaping helpingof gaming goodness.
The second half of the month will see co-op action-roguelike33 Immortalsenter early access, not to mention expansive role-playing gameOctopath Traveler 2(joining Game Pass Standard), the old-school bundleBlizzard Arcade Collection, another day-one drop inAtomfall, and modern classicsBatman: Arkham KnightandTunicfor those content to stick with the basic Xbox Game Pass Core subscription. Here’s the full list:
Xbox Game Pass is also losing a bunch of games on March 24, listed below. If you’re wondering what you should play before then, you can never go wrong withaYakuzagame, especiallyLike a Dragon, which is probably one of the best turn-based role-playing games of the last decade. I’d also be remiss if I didn’t recommendMonster Hunter Rise, which is a more traditional entry in the long-running series than the recently releasedMonster Hunter Wilds.

In thelatest issueofWeekly Famitsu, a poll listsPragmataas the magazine readership’s third most wanted game despite its indefinite delayalmost two years ago.
Pragmatareceived 466 votes, pushing it past big names likeMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater,Pokémon Legends: Z-A, andMetroid Prime 4: Beyond, all of which actually look like they may release within the next year. And this isn’t a one-off or fluke, either. Sinceits revealin 2020,Pragmatahas been a consistent figure in theseFamitsureader polls and in recent years has frequently ranked within the top three. In fact, you have to go all the way back toSeptember 2023to find an issue of the magazine where it wasn’t one of the 10 most wanted games.
While the numbers are surprising, they don’t provide much context. We’ve seen just brief flashes ofPragamataover the last five years thanks to some pretty cinematics and brief snippets of gameplay, so it’s hard to understand exactly what Famitsu readers find so exciting. I’ll admit to being intrigued by the game after its reveal, but its rocky history has relegated it in my mind to the same place asDeep Down, another cool-looking Capcom project that garnered a lot of attention but never saw the light of day.
As it stands, much of what we know aboutPragmatacomes from official Capcom marketing copy, which describes the game as “an all-new action adventure title that depicts a near-future dystopian world on the moon through a deeply profound story and setting,” descriptions which are echoed on thePlayStationandXboxstores.
Pragmatawas delayed from 2022 to 2023just six months after its revealbefore being removed from Capcom’s release calendar altogetherin 2023.
“It is with a heavy heart that we must further postpone the release ofPragmata,” the development team said at the time. “Our team is currently hard at work making the best game that we possibly can, but we need more time. We will continue to do our best to ensure that the final product is one that is worthy of your patience.”
IsPragmatajust anotherDeep Down, or might it make a return à la Fumito Ueda’sThe Last Guardianand surprise even its most stalwart supporters? Is Capcom maybe holding out for a next generation release? It’s hard to say with any certainty, but what is clear is thatPragmatamade a huge impression on the gaming public, and it would be a shame for Capcom to squander that kind of lasting excitement again.

"The 2000s were a wonderful time for movies, good and weird
byAusten GoslinandPete Volk
Toussaint Egan
We didn’t know how good we had it in the 2000s. Sure, some things were awful, but the movie industry was something special. Every year felt like it held something new and fantastic: the Bourne movies,Avatar,Gladiator, Lord of the Rings,Pan’s Labyrinth,Lost in Translation,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, andMulholland Drive, just to name a random handful. On top of that,There Will Be Blood,Michael Clayton,Atonement,Juno, andNo Country for Old Menwere going head to head at the Oscars. And as far as the eye could see, studios were funding ridiculously ambitious, ill-fated sci-fi blockbusters that no one really bothered to watch until they hit cable.
These movies arrived at the perfect moment to be fascinating without necessarily being all that good. Hollywood was ready to spend loads of money on original ideas, and afterThe MatrixandStar Wars: The Phantom Menace, sci-fi was having a moment. So, inspired by those movies, and smaller, more manageable examples like Alex Proyas’Dark CityandThe Crow, directors set out to make their sci-fi dreams a reality. The only problem was that CGI was nowhere near advanced enough for the worlds these creators wanted to build, especially not at the budgets they wanted to build them at. So, an entire microgenre of unashamed, strange blockbusters was born, with high aims, moderate budgets, buckets of creativity, a bit of star power to get the green light from studios, and only the loosest semblance of a script to hold it all together.
The recent release ofPaul W.S. Anderson’s tremendously fun filmIn the Lost Landsfelt like a perfect throwback to that era, with its complex mythology of a Christian cult and a ruined world full of magic — made up mostly of brown and gray CGI and anonymous metal beams. Anderson is a master of this particular type of movie (though audiences generally showed up for his Resident Evil movies), and his latest got us thinking with fond nostalgia on this bygone era of bizarre and unique movies.
In that spirit, we put together a list of some of the very best of the 2000s’ (and early 2010s’) overly ambitious sci-fi movies, each one of which bombed — commercially, critically, or both. Despite their failings, though, the “flopbusters” on this list have stuck in our heads and hearts for nearly 20 years, and that alone is a feat worth celebrating.
Most 2000s thing about it:Ice Cube’s character is named “Desolation Williams.”Where to watch:Free with ads on the Roku Channel, or for digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Fandango
All of John Carpenter’s movies have a delightful B-movie flair to them. ButGhosts of Marstakes the cake in the category. It’s a pseudo-Western on Mars with an all-star cast, including Ice Cube, Pam Grier, and frequent flopbuster star Jason Statham.
The premise is great and allows for a lot of Carpenter narrative creativity: When a freight train on a mission to pick up a prisoner (Ice Cube) returns with only one survivor (Natasha Henstridge), she is interrogated about the series of events, unfolding through a series of interweaving flashbacks.
The performances are strong, and Carpenter scores the movie well as always, but the real strength ofGhosts of Marsis right there in the title. The Martian atmosphere is extremely spooky, and the red tones of the planet’s surface are gorgeous, an effect created by dyeing the gypsum mine they filmed in with red coloring. —Pete Volk
Most 2000s thing about it:Gun Kata.Where to watch:Free on Hoopla, or for digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Fandango
This entire trend in Hollywood owes its life, and its budgets, toThe Matrix, but few movies on this list took that inspiration as seriously asEquilibrium. The movie is a pretty blatant rip-off, but I say that with nothing but love in my heart for it.Equilibriumtakes place shortly after the end of World War III, in a city where emotion and art have been outlawed entirely. However, when John Preston (Christian Bale) suddenly finds a book of poems by W.B. Yeats, he discovers his own emotions and decides to fight back against and destroy the fascist government that has stripped people of the ability to feel.
To do all this rebelling, Preston has to call upon his mastery ofEquilibrium’s most incredible invention: Gun Kata, a gun-based martial art that is equal parts extremely silly and totally sick. All ofEquilibrium’s shootouts and fights scenes involve Preston pulling off incredible feats with guns, doingMatrix-style wire work while shooting dozens of rounds a second out of his semiautomatic pistols, or beating people to death with retractable gun spikes. It’s all bizarre and incredible, and in certain ways feels like a precursor to the John Wick style that dominates action movies today. The exceptionally ridiculous Gun Kata action, combined with one of the bigger and more well-thought-out worlds on this list, makesEquilibriuman absolute flopbuster classic. —Austen Goslin
Most 2000s thing about it:Matt Damonturned downthe lead part because he had just done an amnesia role withThe Bourne Identity.Where to watch:For digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Fandango
Even many of my fellowJohn Woodie-hards won’t go to bat for this one. The movie that led to Woo’s temporary exile from Hollywood filmmaking,Paycheckis based on a Philip K. Dick story and follows a highly skilled engineer (Ben Affleck) whose work is so secretive that he gets his short-term memory wiped after every job. But when a job goes wrong, he has to try and retrace his own (forgotten) steps to get to the bottom of a mystery.
I remember seeing this movie for the first time on cable when I was in high school, and I fully believe that’s the best way to watchPaycheck(on TV, with commercials… high school might be harder to recreate). And yes, it does have one of John Woo’s trademark doves. —PV
Most 2000s thing about it:The fact that the best version of the character only exists in theXbox tie-in game.Where to watch:Prime Video or Starz
Perhaps the best example of this trend,The Chronicles of Riddickis a sequel toPitch Black, a wonderful sci-fi slasher that’s something likeAlien, except if the xenomorph was played by Vin Diesel and he was sort of a good guy. But while the first movie is low-stakes and even lower-budget, the second movie blows the whole thing out to a universal scale.
While we last saw him as a space outlaw on a backwater planet, when we next catch up with Richard B. Riddick, he’s pulled into a conflict with an intergalactic empire. The series pulls off its turn toward space opera surprisingly well, building out a whole spacefaring civilization that feels straight out of Warhammer 40K, complete with massive armor and weapons, a giant capital city, and incredibly convoluted lore. All of this is presented with a terrific blend of seriousness and camp, and while Riddick caring this much about the fate of the universe never quite makes sense, it is one of the most entertaining examples of Hollywood’s sci-fi excess you can find. —AG
Most 2000s thing about it:Roger Ebert called it “an assault on all the senses, including common.”Where to watch:Max, or for digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Fandango
If there’s anything that makes more sense than video games as Paul W.S. Anderson adaptation material, it’s a Roger Corman movie. The 2008Death Raceupdates the great premise of Corman’s cult classic — prisoners compete in a deadly race to try and earn their freedom — and amplifies the vehicular action with some terrific car stunts and flips. You will truly feel the presence of Hollywood car action maestro Spiro Razatos, best known for his work on the Fast and Furious franchise.
So many of Anderson’s movies would fit in this category: the (very good!) Resident Evil movies,Alien vs. Predator, andeven some of his newer moviesthat don’t belong to this specific era. A key element of the mid-2000s flopbuster is a lack of embarrassment over the nerdy stuff in the material, and throughout his decades making video game adaptations and other seemingly silly projects, Anderson has never once flinched. He knows what you’re here for, he knows what he’s here for, and he delivers.
All the 2000s flopbuster notes are here: plenty of CGIto build out the largely gray environments of the prison and the racetrack(but also for some grisly deaths), a villain whose plan makes no sense and whose motivations seem to flip on a dime, and a goofy, violent, fun time in a surprisingly well-realized dystopia. —PV
Most 2000s thing about it:The villain dresses like The Prodigy’s Keith Flint with a big ol’ biohazard symbol tattooed on his back.Where to watch:For digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, YouTube
If your idea of a good time is listening to Malcolm McDowell ominously monologuing over a faux-John Carpenter synth score and post-apocalyptic motorbike rallies that function like Burning Man meets Cirque du Soleil, then boy, do I have a movie for you!Doomsdaywas critically panned when it was released back in ’08 as a derivative and uninspired riff onMad MaxandEscape from New York. And while this is true, it does very little to detract from its appeal as a damn satisfying, albeit very cheesy, action movie.
Rhona Mitra kicks all kinds of ass as Major Eden Sinclair, a special ops soldier with a drone camera for an eye who is sent on a mission into a quarantined Scotland in search of a cure for a deadly super virus. Don’t focus too much on the plot. Instead, just soak in the gloriously over-the-top violence, gladiatorial spectacle, and at times shockingly striking cinematography and lighting. Hell, the climax even essentially boils down to an all-out road war, complete with leather-bound, man-eating ravers and slow-motion explosions. What’s not to like? —Toussaint Egan
Most 2000s thing about it:Action/horror vampires.Where to watch:Free with ads on The Roku Channel or on the CW app, or for digital rental/purchase on Amazon or Apple TV
Vampires were all the rage in the 2000s, and while it’s tempting to credit Twilight with the whole thing, it’s important to remember that it really started withBladein 1998, then the Underworld movies (which would be on this list had they not made as much money and as many sequels as they did) kept the bloodsuckers alive long enough for Bella and Edward to give them a second life. Amid all of that, though, were half a dozen or so smaller vampire movies of various genres. But not a single one of the vampire movies from this era was as big or bold asDaybreakers.
Daybreakerstakes place in a post-apocalyptic world ruled by vampires. Ethan Hawke plays a vampire hematologist who’s trying to solve for the fact that now that vampires rule the world, the world’s running out of blood to drink. In the middle of his research, he comes across a former vampire named Elvis (Willem Dafoe), who thinks he has a cure for vampirism that could save humanity, and maybe the vampires, too. From there, the movie turns into a pretty great little action thriller in a fascinatingly drawn world. ThinkChildren of Men(a movie that could also be on this list but is simply a little too good for it) but with vampires and Willem Dafoe. —AG
Most 2000s thing about it:The Neveldine/Taylor style of chaos cinema editing.Where to watch:Peacock, or for free with ads on Pluto TV
During their six years making movies together, onetime filmmaking duo Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor made some of the most chaotically shot and edited movies of the century. This is a good thing: The Crank movies, their Ghost Rider sequel, andGamerare all among the most visually distinct movies of their generation, with a palpable energy underneath the frantic editing style.
In this one, prisoners on death row compete in a third-person shooter where they are the characters, controlled by gamers behind the scenes. The most popular and successful prisoner in this game (Gerard Butler) works alongside the teenager controlling him (Logan Lerman) to attempt to gain his freedom.Gamerwas also ahead of its time when it comes to itssatire of people’s time in virtual worlds, and features a delightfully over-the-top villain performance from mid-Dexter-era Michael C. Hall (that casting choice is a runner-up for most 2000s thing aboutGamer). —PV
Most 2000s thing about it:A band of militant post-apocalyptic priests who are the good guys (also action/horror vampires).Where to watch:USA Network, or for digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Fandango
Perhaps the wildest movie on this whole list,Priestis going to take some explaining. The movie is set in a world where humans and vampires spent hundreds of years at war, almost completely destroying the Earth’s surface. Finally, humans banded together in a theocratic society under the rule of The Church, which creates a specially trained group of warriors called Priests who can defeat the vampires.
When they do defeat the vampires, The Church rounds up the surviving monsters and puts them in special reservations, but then immediately begins to enact tyrannical totalitarian control over the remaining humans. To escape this, many humans move outside the safety of The Church’s walled city, where they’re more susceptible to bands of roaming vampire survivors. Living outside the walls long after the end of the last war, one particular Priest (Paul Bettany) finds his niece has been kidnapped by vampires, and he has to cross the post-apocalyptic landscape — mostly made out of gray CGI slop — to return to his vampire-killing ways. It’s among the most ambitious and fun premises on this list, and it mostly results in an excuse for some pretty kick-ass vampire-killing action, all of which makes this an excellent addition to the flopbuster canon. —AG
Most 2000s thing about it:A soundtrack consisting entirely of industrial music.Where to watch:Max, or for digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Fandango
Another update of an existing franchise, the 2012Dreddis a crisp sci-fi action movie equal partsThe Raid(which happened to shoot almost simultaneously) and ’80s sci-fi throwback. Karl Urban stars as the violent Judge Dredd, on an assignment with his rookie partner (Olivia Thirlby) to take down a drug kingpin (mid-Game of ThronesLena Headey, another strong casting-from-TV choice in this era that also qualifies as a runner-up for most 2000s thing about this movie) who rules over a skyscraping high-rise.
The verticality in the 200-story building allows for tense and at times shockingly violent action augmented by the visual effects (especially the slow-motion sequences), and the lead performances are all strong. There are plenty of gray tones within the movie, fitting with the era, but the kinetic direction and strong performances hold it all together. Of note: Pete Travis is credited with directing the movie, butUrban has made it clear screenwriter Alex Garland is the one who really directedDredd. —PV

"This week’s games branch out in some new directions
byTyler Colp
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
The new game releases this week may look a little familiar, but all of them attempt to push their genres or series in new directions. We’ve got a dark game about a plague outbreak where you’re finally a certified doctor instead of someone taking up the job out of necessity; a 33-player action game with large-scale battles that resemble raid fights in an MMO; and a baseball game with — wait for it — a roguelike board game mode.
Oh, and there’sAssassin’s Creed Shadowsat the end of the week, with a story set in feudal Japan and a whole base-building system. But that will come afterPathologic 3, which starts the week off with another macabre story of death and decay. Then there’s33 Immortals, a game where you join up with a whole legion of players trying to survive against hordes of monsters.MLB The Show 25promises a bunch of new additions to the series, including that roguelike board game mode. And if sports aren’t for you,Reignbreakeris a game that mixes medieval weaponry with a bit of cyberpunk. It argues that your everyday javelins haven’t gone far enough and introduces “motorized” javelins that explode and launch across the screen like a bullet.
Here are our most anticipated game releases for the week of March 17.
Release date:March 17Platforms:Windows PCA plague has festered in a small town and you’re on the hunt for immortality in this narrative-focused game. With the help of some time travel, you have to do everything you can as a local healer to keep the town from being swallowed whole.
Release date:March 18Platforms:Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis is a co-op action roguelike where 33 players pour onto the battlefield and try to survive against God’s armies of monsters. Battles are modeled after MMO raid fights and require you to rally everyone together to overcome them.
Release date:March 18 (early access March 14)Platforms:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series XThe only major MLB simulation franchise returns with a new year, three new cover athletes, and a lot of new features.Fielding has been revamped, the Road to the Show mode now starts in high school, and Diamond Dynasty has a new roguelike game mode that I can’t wait to dig into. —Pete Volk
Release date:March 18Platforms:Windows PCI’m pretty sure this roguelike action game invented the sequel to javelins. They’re called motorized javelins and they spin, explode, and skewer the robotic monsters chasing you in every level. Put down your swords and your hammers; it’s time for the javelins.
Release date:March 20Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XAssassin’s Creed finally makes its way to feudal Japan. The story is split between two characters this time: Naoe is an assassin and Yasuke is a samurai. You get to recruit a whole network of spies and build a hideout like it was The Sims. This game has it all.
Release date:March 20Platforms:Windows PCSome call it “full-contact” racing, but really it’s racing where the cars smash into each other. This game is entirely built for that, with tons of customization and a whole physics engine made to simulate what happens when metal slams into metal. Now, wrecking your car isn’t necessarily the best way to win a race, but it’s certainly the most fun.

"Cozy gaming is great, and these games add something new to the formula
byCass Marshall
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
It’s nice to be cozy. I’m a huge fan of being wrapped up in a big blanket, sipping hot chocolate, and leisurely walks under colorful autumn trees. Cozy games are also great, and they’re an increasingly popular genre. While I’ve spent hours preparing the perfect farm inStardew Valleyor exploring Bahari Bay inPalia, it can be fun to subvert the genre and play a cozy game with a twist on the formula.
These games are still cozy, but there’s something else added to make things a little uncomfortable, uneasy, or unpredictable. These games might have a greater message or a threat hidden amid its soothing, comfy vibes. A garnish of anxiety, fear, or danger can elevate the rest of the game’s cozy elements, making for a great experience all the way through.
Where to play:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XWanderstopis a game about an adventurer named Alta who falters in battle and finds herself working at a humble tea shop instead. Alta gathers the herbs to create tea, boils pots of water, and chats with customers. There are no registers, no tips, no cash exchanges — tea shop owner Boro isn’t running a commercial business, but making a tea shop for his community out of sheer love of the game. There’s plenty of cozy to be found in Alta’s routine of gathering leaves and setting them out to dry. It’s also fun to sit for tea with Boro and decorate the shop. But at its heartWanderstopis a story about burnout, recovery, and healing.
Where to play:Windows PCInCrime Scene Cleaner, I play a hardworking man picking up some extra work from the mob. I don’t carry out wet work myself, but I show up afterward to clean things up. It’s easy to fall into a soothing rhythm of mopping floors, pressure-washing walls, and shoving broken glass or bullet casings into the trash. It’s certainly a little macabre to haul dead bodies out to the truck and clean up the blood splatter, but it’s easy to fall into a rhythm. The tone of the game is more silly than morbid, and if you enjoyPowerWash SimulatororHouse Flipper, you’ll likely enjoy this one too.
Where to play:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XWhat could be more relaxing than sailing a little boat across the harbor, catching fish, and selling them to the friendly locals? Just make sure you don’t sail at night, or investigate any of the mysterious incidents that keep cropping up around the remote archipelago known as The Marrows.Dredgeis wonderfully creepy and calming in turns, and the more the player scratches at the surface, the more Lovecraftian mystery there is to discover.
Where to play:Mac, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox OneOK, hear me out on this one.RimWorld is notorious for being a difficult survival simulatorwhere the player is forced into making morally compromised choices, but there are also periods of peace and stability. The player controls a sci-fi colony, slowly building a few survivors into an actual settlement. The game is a story simulator, so the colony is affected by random events — a psychic drone may cause mental stress on all male colonists, a raider band might strike in the night, or a bad wound could develop an infection and kill a crucial player. Luckily,RimWorldoffers robust settings, allowing the player to either embrace the chaos and random chance or turn things way down and simply enjoy watching their civilization grow and prosper.
Where to play:Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XInCult of the Lamb, you play as the titular lamb as they battle against oppressive gods and build their own cult from the ground up. I cannot stress enough that the art style for this game is adorable, capable of inspiring someone to go “Aww!” even as they sacrifice a little frog guy to their dark cause. While the roguelike dungeon crawls are fun, the real meat of the game lies in the cult management mechanics. Players will have to keep their followers safe, free from illness, and engaged in the collective faith. It’s up to you how you achieve that goal — or choose to delve into wanton sacrifice and slaughter.
Where to play:Android, iOS, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox OneTo the untrained eye, one might think the scary part ofGraveyard Keeperis the plethora of skeletons. Actually, it’s the fact that the game is a riff on capitalism. The player takes control of a medieval graveyard, expanding their grounds and improving their services over time. This job is further complicated by dungeon dives, alchemical breakthroughs, and resource management. It’s a genuinely funny little game that also presents challenging choices that will test your sense of ethics.
Where to play:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XTeamwork makes the dream work, and there’s no partner you can trust like your spouse. InRavenous Devils, the player controls both husband and wife as they settle into a new life together with a new tailor shop/bakery combination business. Percival works upstairs, while Hildred bakes and serves customers. I mean that quite literally, as the duo have found a cheap way to figure out supplies. Percival murders customers, Hildred slaughters them, and both businesses benefit from the influx of cheap clothes and meat. It’s a dark twist on an otherwise delightful cooking game, especially since the police can check Percival’s shop for any evidence of his many murders.

However, once protagonist Tara settles into her cottagecore home and begins training as a witch, she discovers a disturbing thread that leads to unsettling revelations. While the game remains relatively lighthearted, there are some fun mysteries and creepy cultlike incidents to investigate.

From there, the player can mine, fish, chat with townsfolk, and settle into their new life. There’s just one big problem: One of those friendly villagers is a murderer, and there’s something strange and supernatural about Ashenridge. Developer Perfect Garbage has partnered with Blumhouse Games, and while there’s no release date, the premise of the game is extremely intriguing.
Where to play:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XSome people find the act of disassembling and organizing a big project to be meditative, andHardspace: Shipbreakeris a fantastic example of this. Yes, the wrong move could lead to an explosive result, and it’s possible to die in some truly terrible ways. But with the right settings, I find it relaxing to simply cut through hulls, tear ships apart, and watch numbers go up as I perfect my technique. There’s still a massive debt hanging over my head, and lots of commentary on capitalism, but I can’t help but find pleasure in a job well done and a ship stripped down for parts.

Silent Hill f, the first main-series entry in over a decade, is still on its way. Konami hasn’t mentioned it forquite some time, but anew trailershown during aSilent Hill Transmission streamon Thursday confirms it’s still very real.
The new trailer, which borrows imagery from what we saw of the game inthe first trailer, follows a young girl living in a small Japanese town during the 1960s — a first for the series. Fog engulfs the town and the girl starts to see flowers before running into a shambling woman. More monsters show up and we see the girl picking up a pipe to defend herself against something off-screen, with a spore-covered house behind her.
Silent Hill fis being developed by a Taiwan-based studio named NeoBards Entertainment with help from Japanese developers. The stream had more details on the game’s production, with appearances from writer Ryukishi07 and character and creature designer Kera. On the stream, Konami dug into its setting and how it used reference photos and sounds to help create the game’s rural town, and discussed the psychological themes it wants to explore with its young protagonist.
The trailer doesn’t have a release date, but it confirms thatSilent Hill fwill be released on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. You can also wishlist it now onSteam.

"I hope you like your soap improved and clingy
byCass Marshall
PowerWash Simulatoris a surprisingly cozy game, giving the player a pressure washer and a truly grimy and grubby environment to clean up. The game has been so successful that there are crossovers with other pop culture titans, likeWarhammer 40,000orTomb Raider. On Thursday, developer FuturLab announced a self-published sequel with improved visuals, a new campaign, and new hygienic gadgets to try. The game is expected to be released later this year on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox.
FuturLab released a short teaser trailer for the game, which doesn’t show too much in the way of new features, but it looks like the game will have all the satisfying spray action we have come to expect from the predecessor. What’s really exciting is the addition of split-screen multiplayer, so contractors can play with pals in person or online.
“The original game’s design was all about eliminating anything that detracted from the pure satisfaction of taking something dirty and making it clean.PowerWash Simulator 2is all about adding in even more avenues for players to achieve that same sense of satisfaction, with new tools, features and quality of life improvements,” says Dan Chequer, Design Director at FuturLab, in a press release.
Players will get to see more of Muckingham, the original game’s setting, as well as travel out to places like Sponge Valley, Power Falls, and Lubri City. The press release also promises more effective soap, shared campaign progress online, and a customizable home base. While no release date was announced, FuturLab is expected to share more information in April.

"How often does it just tell you to ‘git gud’?
byIan Walker
Microsoft is preparing to add “artificial intelligence” — acomplete misnomerthat everyone continues to use nonetheless — to its video game platforms via the upcoming Copilot for Gaming program. An “early preview” is coming to mobile for Xbox Insiders soon, but we got ourfirst lookat how the gameplay assistant may function on the March 13 episode of The Official Xbox Podcast.
“This AI-driven sidekick is designed to be your personalized gaming companion, helping you get to your favorite games faster, coaching you to improve your skills, and connecting you better with your friends and communities,” Jeff Rubenstein, director of Xbox editorial, explained on Xbox Wire. “Copilot for Gaming will be there when you need it but out of the way if you don’t.”
A couple of the proof-of-concept Copilot for Gaming examples shown on The Official Xbox Podcast include suggesting items to create inMinecraftbased on what’s in the player’s inventory and providing an on-screen strategy guide for defeating a siege engine inAge of Empires IV.
The big question mark about Copilot for Gaming — and really anything that presents itself as “artificial intelligence” — is how it’s getting its information and from where. This technology isn’t learning in any real sense, but simply acting as a personalized search engine sifting through the terabytes ofillicitly obtaineddata OpenAI uses to train its GPT-4 large language model. Copilot for Gaming could very well be pulling info from any number of guides from sites like Polygon, Kotaku, and IGN or even tips shared on Reddit, ResetEra, and GameFAQs.
It’s also hard to take Microsoft at its word that one of Copilot for Gaming’s goals is “connecting you better with your friends” when The Official Xbox Podcast host Ethan Rothamel eagerly envisions a future where he won’t have to help guide his mom, who picked up gaming during COVID, through levels ofHuman Fall Flatanymore. Why share any sort of connection with your loved ones, especially those not previously predisposed to gaming, when you can pawn them off on an AI assistant instead?
Polygon is in the process of asking Microsoft about these concerns and will report back when we learn more.

"And its announcement is imminent
byOli Welsh
A full remake of Bethesda’s classic 2006 role-playing gameThe Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivioncould be announced imminently — and could even be released within the next couple of months, according to new reports.
TheOblivionremake has long been rumored, and was included in alist of Bethesda projectsdating back to 2020. That list leaked in 2023 when the Microsoft presentation it formed part of was included in leaked court documents.
Now NatetheHate, a well-connected insider,has saidthe game will be announced in March or April, and released “likely sooner than the original June target.”VGC corroborated this reportand went a step further, suggesting the game could be released as early as April.
Various reports have suggested theOblivionremake is being developed, at least in part, by Virtuos, which is currently assisting Konami with development ofMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a remake ofMetal Gear Solid 3.
According to a recent report byMP1st, citing a leak by a former Virtuos employee,Oblivionhas been fully remade in Unreal Engine 5, and the new version of the game substantially overhauls several gameplay systems, including stamina, sneaking, blocking, and archery. Blocking is supposedly inspired by Soulslike games, while the stamina system is reportedly more lenient in combat encounters.
Oblivionwas a hit when it was released on Windows PC and Xbox 360 in 2006, bringing the Elder Scrolls series to a wider audience and setting Bethesda Game Studios up for the supernova success ofFallout 3in 2008 andThe Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrimin 2011. In the continuing absence of even the smallest morsel of information aboutThe Elder Scrolls 6, a chance to revisit Cyrodiil would be most welcome.

"Ubisoft previously said Valve’s handheld wasn’t powerful enough
byOli Welsh
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
Ubisoft has announced thatAssassin’s Creed Shadowswill be supported on Steam Deck at launch, despite previously saying that Valve’s handheld was not powerful enough to run the upcoming blockbuster.
In aposton the official Assassin’s Creed X (formerly Twitter) account, Ubisoft said, “Many of you have been asking about Steam Deck. We are happy to say that we are supporting Steam Deck at launch and are currently awaiting the level of classification from Valve. More info to come soon.”
By “level of classification,” Ubisoft is referring to whether Valve will tag the game as Verified or merely Playable on the handheld. To attain Verified status, games must run well on default settings, plus have controls and an interface that are well configured for the device. But Ubisoft seems confident enough to make Steam Deck support official.
It’s a surprising move, because as little as a month ago,Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ technology director Pierre Fsaid in a tech Q&Athat the game “will not be compatible with Steam Deck, due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC.”
Assassin’s Creed Shadowsis very much a cutting-edge, AAA production. It is not being released on last-generation consoles and thePC system requirementsdon’t even allow for ray tracing to be turned off. Getting it running well on the capable but relatively humble Steam Deck will not be an easy feat for Ubisoft’s engineers.
Until recently, the Steam Deck has been able to keep up with most recent releases. But this deep into the console generation, with support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One becoming a rarity, the three-year-old device is struggling to run new releases likeMonster Hunter Wilds— and it’s questionable whether it has a big enough user base for developers to actively support it. In that context, Ubisoft’s decision to support the device withAssassin’s Creed Shadowsis laudable, if not brave. It will be interesting to see how well the game performs on Steam Deck.

"Defense wins championships, which the 2024 Yankees found out the hard way
bySamit Sarkar
Fielding is perhaps the unsung hero of every baseball video game. There probably aren’t many MLB The Show players who ask themselves, upon first firing up the new game each year,What’s new on defense?But of course, it’s just as important a pillar of the sport as pitching, hitting, or baserunning — as my beloved Yankees found out when they frittered away a five-run lead in Game 5 of the 2024 World Series, in what is perhapsthe most mind-boggling, soul-crushing, Lemony-Snicket-ain’t-got-shit-on-this collapsein the 120-year history of the Fall Classic.
MLB The Show has now existed as a video game franchise for just about one-sixth of that time period — it began with 2006’sMLB 06: The Show, making this year’sMLB The Show 25the 20th entry in the series — and for its entire run, the same person has led the gameplay team at developer SIE San Diego Studio. That has made the franchise a renowned model of consistency, but it also presents some challenges. Namely: With such a well-established, solid foundation, are you forever stuck tinkering on the margins?
“Every year, we’ll say, ‘Oh, we’ve added hundreds of new gameplay animations.’ And people will say, ‘Well, the game looks the same,’” said Sony’s Ramone Russell, director of product development, communications, and brand strategy at Sony San Diego, in an interview with me last month. These players are not entirely wrong, of course — when an annual sports game gets a few hundred items added to an animation library that numbers in the tens of thousands, players will likely need to spend a significant amount of time on the virtual diamond before their eyes catch something they’ve never seen before.
Part of the trouble when it comes to representing fielding in a video game is not just that it’s tough to make it as fun and engaging as pitching or hitting. It’s also difficult to convey the differences in skill between a league-average defender and a Gold Glove winner, at least in a way that doesn’t simply annoy players. In order to do that, the developers have to take some controloutof players’ hands. Russell said there’s effectively a dice roll under the hood, based on certain in-game attributes that each fielder possesses, that helps determine how likely it is that any given player will be able to get to a particular batted ball. (Cue MLB The Show players wailing at their TVs when a seeing-eye grounder trickles into the outfield, just out of a defender’s reach.)
This is actually a change that Sony San Diego made forMLB The Show 24last year, but the game didn’t communicate it to players in any way. Now there’s a visual indicator of how good a jump your infielder got on a ball: blue for the fastest reaction time, green for an average one, and yellow for the slowest. The gameplay connection here is that the fielding animation you see corresponds to the reaction time. Even if three shortstops with varying skill levels can each get to the same hypothetical ground ball, an elite defender will be able to field it more cleanly than the others, and transition to a throwing animation more smoothly and quickly; meanwhile, the lower-level fielders may stumble a bit as they pick up the ball, delaying their throw enough to allow the runner to reach base safely.
The developers’ goal is to make it “easier to see the difference between below-average, average, great, and amazing” infielders, according to Russell. “And hopefully you won’t get as mad when your shortstop misses this ball. You’re like,Why did he play that animation and miss that ball?It’s like,Oh, I see this yellow thing. That means he got a bad jump, and he got a bad jump because his fielding rating isn’t as good.”
As soon as Russell demonstrated how this system works inMLB The Show 25, I saw its potential to make my favorite mode, Road to the Show, more rewarding. I do get a lot of joy and fulfillment out of the career mode’s basic rhythm, which follows the languid pace of a baseball season. It’s the simple pleasure of jumping into another game and stepping up to the plate for another at-bat — a new opportunity to prove myself and raise my game — that keeps me going. But the grind can feel abstract at times, with such a gradual progression from promising prospect to big-league All-Star.
This year’s fielding feedback icons offer something concrete to work toward. The jump that an infielder gets is tied directly to their reaction attribute (REAC), which has tiers that correspond to probabilities on the field: If your player’s REAC rating is under 50, you’ll literally never see them get a great jump. But when you raise it to that threshold, it unlocks that possibility (albeit with a relatively low chance). Once you improve the attribute to 70, they’ll have, say, a 40% chance of getting a great jump. And an infielder with a 99 REAC will have the fastest possible reaction time on every ball hit in their direction.
I plan to spend hours upon hours inMLB The Show 25’s Road to the Show mode, as I do every year. But this time around, I’m particularly looking forward to raising my created player’s fielding abilities — something I’ve rarely thought about in the past — and anticipating the rush of satisfaction upon seeing that blue glow beneath his feet for the first time.
MLB The Show 25is scheduled to launch March 18 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X.

"Looking for a dragon game? We’ve got you
byNicole Carpenter
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.
What’s a dragon game? That’s any game that’s got dragons in it — typically, a game that prominently features dragons. While some dragons in dragon games are less prominent, they are no less important. Dragon games can be a part of any genre, be it the ever challengingElden Ringor the cozy life simulatorLittle Dragons Café. Whatever sort of game you’re looking to play, there’s probably a dragon game that fits within that genre.
And I’m an expert at this because, of course, I love dragons. A couple years ago, I read the nine books inNaomi Novik’s Temeraire series, and I was hooked.I’d never been a big fantasy reader— until then. I set off the following yearlargely reading only books that featured dragons. Eventually,the obsession seeped into the video games I played, too.
As for this list, there is one obvious choice of a dragon game, one that most people likely know:The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim, so I’m leaving it off. But do know, it’s an all-timer for dragons — and, if for some reason you haven’t played it yet, give it a try. But if you’re looking for something different, something that maybe you haven’t heard of or hadn’t realized was a dragon game, keep reading.
Where to play:Windows PCFields of Mistriaisn’t necessarilyaboutdragons, but its March 10 update made its dragon even more prominent. Caldarus, the town of Mistria’s dragon guardian, leads the player and imbues them with magic to assist in bringing the town back to life.Everyone’s wanted to date him, and, well, they might be able to now.
Where to play:PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XYes, you do often have to fight dragons inElden Ring, but the creatures aren’t just treated like pure beasts.Dragons inElden Ringare full, three-dimensional beingsthat have the same rich lore that the rest of the world benefits from. It’s one of the best dragon games for dragon lovers, if you go looking for its engaging, detailed lore.
Where to play:Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PCLittle Dragons Caféis for the dragon warriors among us who are looking for a slower, cozier life than that ofElden Ring. A brother-and-sister duo running a small restaurant are given a dragon egg and tasked with running the business while raising the dragon. It’s a little rough around the edges, but if you’re looking for a slower pace and to raise a dragon, you’ll want to give it a go.
Where to play:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XIf you want to play as a dragon,Age of Wonders 4’sDragon DawnDLC is what you’re looking for.Age of Wonders 4is a 4X turn-based strategy game where you’re building a fantasy empire. TheDragon Dawnexpansion builds on that, except you play as the dragon ruler of a dragon empire, making both enemies and allies with the dragon elders that are at war.
Where to play:Nintendo SwitchYes,The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdomis a dragon game. It might not be known for its dragons, but dragons it has,and they’re actually super important to the game’s narrative. InTears of the Kingdom, you’ll see dragons floating above the clouds, and you find one of the dragons’ tears — imbued with memories — fallen around Hyrule. Plus, the designs are gorgeous; Nintendo’s created some of the best-looking dragons in games.

"Hideo Kojima plays Dr. Yoshimi Tokui
byNicole Carpenter
Control’s Ultimate Edition got a new update on Monday, which adds new content to the game five years after its launch. That new (for many) content includes a cameo fromDeath StrandingdirectorHideo Kojima, who plays Dr. Yoshimi Tokui. “The mission is playable when you pick up the Dr Tokui Tapes collectible in the Extrasensory Lab of the Research Sector,” Remedy Entertainment community manager Vida Starcevicwrote in a post on theControlwebsite. This mission was previous only available to players on the PlayStation 4 Digital Deluxe edition.
Kojima seemingly recorded the lines for theControlmission in 2019,according to a post from his personal assistant. Kojima and Remedy Entertainment director Sam Lake swapped cameos;Lake made a cameo inDeath Strandingas Veteran Porter. Both games were released in 2019, and both topped plenty of game of the year lists,including Polygon’s.
As for the rest of the update,Controlplayers got three new outfits, which were previously preorder exclusive items. There were also some graphics and DLSS updates, as well as bug fixes. One of those general updates was to the audio on some cinematics and end credits, where there was apparently some mixing problems. “It wasn’t the Hiss, it was us,” Starcevic wrote. “Sorry.”
So far, the update is only for PC players. Remedy Entertainment expects to release the update on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X “in the near future.”
Both Lake and Kojima are working on follow-ups to their 2019 releases;Remedy Entertainment is working onControl 2, while Kojima’s Kojima Productionsis working onDeath Stranding 2: On the Beach.

"Slime Heroes has good ideas but rough execution
byMichael McWhertor
Pitched as a cute, approachable “Souls-lite,”Slime Heroescombines two of my favorite things in video games: adorable slimes andDark Souls-style gameplay. Despite some good ideas,Slime Heroes’ recipe doesn’t quite work. Yes, it’s cute, but it also feels frustrating, clumsy, and unfinished.
Slime Heroescasts the player as a colorful, customizable blob who fights way above its weight class in an attempt to save a fantasy world from a spreading corruption. Played from a top-down isometric perspective, my slime has a variety of attacks at its disposal: a light attack, a heavy attack, and a jumping smash attack that adorably transforms my slime into a smashing fist or an anvil. I quickly earned spell-like skills that let me throw projectiles or summon a whirlwind that sucks in my enemies.
My slime can also find equippable weapons, like swords and spears, out in the world. (These weapons are also composed of slime.) And like any good video game protagonist, my slime can wear hats (and other accessories) that grant it super speed, health regeneration, or extra vitality.
Being a “Souls-lite,”Slime Heroesadopts various concepts from games likeDark Souls. In addition to light and heavy attacks for all weapons, my slime can dodge to avoid taking damage, a move that’s limited by a stamina meter of sorts. When my slime perishes — the remaining ooze spells out things like “ouch,” which is cute — it respawns at the last safe point I visited,Slime Heroes’ bonfire equivalent. And upon death, the shards I’ve collected from enemies I’ve defeated wait for me at the location of my defeat. These souls… er, shards can be spent on various slime upgrades.
Slime Heroesbuilds on solid concepts established by more than a decade of Souls games, but developer Pancake Games comes up short on adapting them in a cute, kid-friendly setting. Combat feels mushy and too simplistic to remain engaging. After battling a handful of the same dull enemy types again and again, I opted to simply scoot by many of them, bypassing combat when I could. Platforming has a similarly spongy feeling; it just doesn’t feel great to move through this world.
There is one very good idea at the heart ofSlime Heroes, though. As I progressed through its fantasy world, I unlocked skills that could be combined in clever ways. A skill like Whirlwind, which creates a vacuum-like tornado, can be combined with a skill like Projectile, so that my slime shoots a moving whirlwind. Or I can combine that Whirlwind with a Breath attack, causing the tornado that I summon to spit out columns of Breath attacks. What’s more, I can combine special effects with each skill, allowing me to add life-steal effects, fire, ice, and other modifiers for a massive number of unique combinations.
You can even summon familiars that fight on your behalf and modify them to fire meteors, resulting in screen-filling magical effects. Experimenting with these combinations can be fun, and I’d love to see other games built onSlime Heroes’ skill effects.
Unfortunately, the user interface forSlime Heroesmakes swapping skills, their primary and secondary effects, and their bonus special effects into something of a chore. Much of the UI is clunky, just part of an overall lack of polish on the game that’s incredibly disappointing.
It’s hard to recommendSlime Heroesto anyone looking for their next Soulslike fix. Kids might like it for its cute, well-animated characters, though I can see it being overly frustrating for an unskilled player;Slime Heroesdoesn’t do a good enough job with guiding players on what to do next or where to go. But it is kid- and new player-friendly in other ways, thanks to two-player couch and online co-op (a feature I didn’t get to test), and accessibility options that lower enemy damage and boost damage dealt by the heroic slime of its story.Slime Heroescan be really, really easy if you tune it right.
That’s not enough to makeSlime Heroesrise above its shortcomings. There’s good intention here, and some very cute visuals, but it’s missing what makes other Souls games great: finely tuned game mechanics.

"Codenamed ‘Keenan,’ per report
byNicole Carpenter
In 2024,Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer told Polygonhe couldn’t stop thinking about what an Xbox handheld could be. Months later, Spencer told Bloomberg Microsofthadindeed been thinking about it,but that it’s a piece of hardware that’s still years outfrom becoming a reality. That plan seems to have shifted:Windows Central reportedMonday that Microsoft will debut a handheld gaming device in 2025 “if plans are met,” with hardware that’s being developed by a partner — something akin to Valve’s partnership with Lenovoto bring the SteamOS to the Legion Go S.
Microsoft’s own proprietary handheld is still in the works, according to Windows Central, and is expected to be years away, reportedly part of the corporation’s next-generation plans for 2027 alongside the Xbox Series X successor. Polygon has not independently confirmed the launch of an Xbox handheld — either in 2025, or in 2027 with a next-generation console — but we’ve reached out to Microsoft for comment.
The reported 2025 “partner handheld” is codenamed Keenan, per Windows Central, and “will look unmistakably ‘Xbox’ […] complete with an official Xbox guide button, and Xbox design sensibilities.” Details, otherwise, are slim, leaving lots of questions on what exactly the handheld is or could be. Is this a reskinned iteration on theASUS ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, or another handheld? Something more unique to Xbox?
“I want my Lenovo Legion Go to feel like an Xbox,” Spencer told Polygon last year. “I brought [the Legion Go] with me to GDC. I’m on the airplane and I have this list of everything that makes it not feel like an Xbox. Forget about the brand. More like: Are all of my games there? Do all my games show up with the save that I want?”
If Spencer has any say, the upcoming Xbox handheld, regardless of who manufactures it, will certainly attempt to have that Xbox feel.

The new game releases this week are proof that cute animals make everything better. Shooters? Better if you’re an animal. Boba shop management sim? Great, now let me play as a penguin. Samurai game set in 19th-century Japan? Sounds like it needs a cat. There are games this week that don’t have animals, but we all know they’d be even better if they did.
Cheaters Cheetahis an FPS where you use cheats that people get banned for in other games, and you also play as bipedal cheetahs. It’s a ridiculous premise that I’m surprised I haven’t seen before. Following that,Rise of the Roninwill be released on PC. Everyone waiting forGhost of Yōteimight want to check it out for a little samurai action. And then there’sWanderstop, a cozy-ish game that’s also about burnout, dropping on the same day.
Here are our most anticipated game releases for the week of March 10.
Release date:March 10Platforms:Windows PCYou wouldn’t cheat in a multiplayer FPS, would you? Of course not. But in this game, the cheats are the whole point. You get access to broken things like the ability to see enemies through walls, auto-aim, and a bunch of other typically unfair things. A former cheat developer even worked on this game!
Release date:March 11Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PCThis open-world action RPG is making its way to Steam this week. You play as a ronin searching for his lost partner in 19th-century Japan. It’s a mix ofSekiro-style combat with a unique “vendetta” mechanic based around defeating enemies who have previously bested you.
Release date:March 11Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThis game is set up like a tea shop management sim, but it’s actually about burnout and not wanting to run a business at all. You’ll brew tea and decorate your shop while contemplating whether any of it is worth it as Alta, a championship fighter in limbo.
Release date:March 11Platforms:Windows PCWe’ve all dreamed of being a little penguin running a boba tea shop, and this game has made it a reality. You get to make drinks, meet friends, grow plants, and fight off your enemies with a boba cannon.
Release date:March 13Platforms:Nintendo Switch, Windows PCThis is a cute little mystery game about a writer looking for inspiration. The game is making its debut on the Nintendo Switch this week, and seems perfect for anyone looking for something lighter than your typical detective game.
Release date:March 13Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PCNothing good can happen in a dark room where everyone has a flashlight and a gun. This multiplayer game is all about deceiving your opponents and sneaking through a mansion full of traps and other hazards while trying to be the last one standing.
Release date:March 13Platforms:PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series XThe action RPG where you get a hoverboard and a bunch of cool powers is making its way to the PS5. You’ll slay monsters in dungeons and solve puzzles by manipulating the environment. There’s also a ton of outfits to wear, and we all know fashion is the true endgame of any good action RPG.

"This delightful fusion of Silent Hill, Persona, and light-gun shooters is now out on consoles
byMichael McWhertor
I had no idea what I was getting into when I jumped into the world ofSorry We’re Closed, a narrative-driven survival horror adventure that pairs the grime and decay of Silent Hill with the stylish, sexed-up demons of Persona games. But the artists behindSorry We’re Closedhave managed to remix some of my favorite gaming memories into something unique and surprising.
That even includes pairing Resident Evil-style tank controls and fixed camera angles with arcade light-gun shooters. Somehow all of these disparate gameplay influences come together in a nearly magical way.
Sorry We’re Closedfocuses on Michelle, a struggling, heartbroken Londoner who has an unlucky encounter with a sleep-paralysis archdemon known as the Duchess. This experience sends Michelle on a journey of discovery, during which she becomes immersed in a world of angels and demons in conflict; this experience ultimately unlocks magical powers within her. Cursed with mystical vision through a third eye, Michelle can see through the veil of the real world into the demon world and converse with its residents.
The Duchess has pursued Michelle as part of the archdemon’s mission to find love, and she’ll stop at nothing to convince her heartbroken prey to give in to these advances. Rebuffing her archdemon suitor, Michelle works with her friends (some of whom have secretly been demons this whole time) to break free of the Duchess’ curse and chase down the archdemon’s former flames/victims.
Michelle’s Evil Eye vision comes into play both narratively and in gameplay. With the press of a button and a snap of her fingers, Michelle can see other layers of her world, uncovering secret doors, hidden objects, and the corporeal forms of ethereal figures.Sorry We’re Closeduses this vision for environmental puzzles as well; a painting of eyes on a wall in the real world is revealed to be a smart-mouthed eye demon that blocks a pathway, and obstructions like an indestructible metal box can be revealed in the demon world as wooden boxes that can be smashed with an ax.
These Evil Eye powers also factor into combat. In the real world, you’ll face monsters that can be killed with multiple swings of an ax or riddled with bullets. But if Michelle flicks on her Evil Eye, she can see into the hearts of her enemies, attacking their weak point to slay them quickly. Michelle’s otherworldly vision only extends so far, though. There’s a trade-off between fighting enemies inefficiently in the real world at distance and allowing them to get closer so Michelle can kill them quickly but incur more risk in the process.
Combat and movement can be a bit clunky inSorry We’re Closed. While exploration is done in third-person view, combat switches to a sometimes disorienting first-person view. Here, the developers draw influence from light-gun games like Time Crisis or House of the Dead, pushing the player to attack rapidly and chain together combos. Pulling off a series of perfect attacks charges up a weapon called the Heartbreaker, a powerful rifle that deals massive damage to enemy demons.
Combat encounters inSorry We’re Closedclicked with me, but I can see them being a sticking point for some players. Fortunately, failure inSorry We’re Closedis rarely frustrating. The game has a manual save system with frequent save points and generous autosaving. While rationing bullets and health items — water bottles, because it’s important to stay hydrated — is a concern, the game is less punishing than many other survival horror games. (Accessibility options can also make the game much, much easier.)
Beyond combat and exploration of the game’s demonic worlds, Michelle spends a good deal of her time conversing with friends, frenemies, and the angels and demons she can see through her third eye. There’s a rich cast of characters, many of them relatably flawed people trying their best to find love or heal from trauma. These characters (and monsters) are all beautifully realized;Sorry We’re Closedoozes style with its mix of horny, elegant, and wonderfully weird misfits. It’s lovely to see a horror game with bright, flashy pops of color.
Sorry We’re Closedhas been out on PC platforms since November 2024. Developer à la mode games and publisher Akupara Games have since brought the game to consoles (Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X) and upgraded the original release with new features. For survival horror fans looking for a queer-romance-infused spin on retro Resident Evil-style gameplay,Sorry We’re Closedcomes highly recommended. You might just fall in love, which is exactly what the Duchess wants.
Sorry We’re Closedwas released Nov. 14, 2024, on Windows PC and March 6 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

"﻿Want some tea?
byNicole Carpenter
A few years ago, a sound bite went viral on TikTok: “Darling, I’ve told you several times before, I have no dream job. I do not dream of labor.”As writer Caitlyn Clark put it in Jacobin at the time, it’s no surprise that the statement resonated with people: a “tighter labor market,” Clark wrote, put increased pressure on workers over the past several years. It’s an increased strain that’s put more and more money in the pockets of the richest among us, yet it hasn’t created better workplaces or a better world for the rest of us. And I’ve been thinking about this phrase — “I do not dream of labor” — as I play developer Ivy Road’sWanderstop. Though the foot on protagonist Alta’s neck is not one of a corporation, but of an individual drive to succeed at all costs — certainly influenced by culture at large — she is ultimately worn down so severely that she can no longer continue. She’s forced to rest, to engage in a less laborious life. But her new life does, indeed, involve labor.
Wanderstopbegins with prolific and successful fighter Alta failing. It’s her first major failure — something she vowed would never happen to her. She had gone to a forest in search of a woman who can train her up, bring her back to her peak form, but the journey didn’t go as planned. Where she lands, instead, is a tea shop. The affable tea shop owner, Boro, plucked her from the forest after she collapsed, no longer able to wield her sword. She doesn’t want to stay, but she also can’t leave: Every time she tries, she collapses. She can’t hold her sword. And so, she does stay. People start to trickle into the tea shop and its surrounding clearing, so she makes them tea.
At this point, Alta probably does dream of labor — the labor of training and fighting for redemption. But over the course of roughly a dozen hours, she begins to let go of that compulsion. Alta trades one type of labor for another: one that’s more caring, slow, and, yes, healing.Wanderstop’s tea shop does not operate for profit. The land around the shop provides everything necessary to make a cup of tea, aside from the tea-making contraption itself. This is whereWanderstoppulls in its cozy gaming elements — the comforting repetition of a farming simulator, with a little twist, is the backbone of its gameplay. Working as Alta, I must plant seeds in specific formations to produce different sorts of plants to harvest both seeds and fruits; the seeds keep the farming running, and the fruits I use to brew tea. I explore the forest for tea leaves, sweep up piles of dead greenery, and snip invasive vines. The tea leaves get dried, and then I can make tea for the different people who pass by.
Each of these people stays briefly at the tea shop, their own stories playing out with every interaction. At first, Alta is desperate for labor — begging people to let her make them tea. But that attitude shifts with each cup of tea she makes as she grapples with her dark past, something she’s long blocked out. Her new form of labor, the act of foraging for ingredients, growing essential fruits, and brewing tea to serve to others, is what’s healing her; she’s engaging in her community in a useful, thoughtful way. Her labor makes a difference not only for herself, but for others, too. Separated from an exploitative system, her work means something more. Beyond the narrative,Wanderstoplargely succeeds at engaging with this ideology through its gameplay. I’m not necessarily rewarded in any way for brewing tea for people in the clearing, other than learning their own stories and preferences. This doesn’t unlock tools to do the job better or faster; I brew tea the same, complicated way each time, using a big ol’ contraption that requires several steps of manual labor.
There’s no real time limit on appeasing these customers; they’ll stay for as long as necessary to get their cup of tea. If you wanted, instead, to brew a dozen cups for yourself or Boro, that’s quite all right. Maybe you’d rather play around with decorations, or test out new combinations of patterns to grow other plants. That’s OK, too. ButWanderstopis a game, and there are still plenty of game-y elements that do detract from its themes. It’s pretty aggressive with its notification icons, for one, so it’s always immediately clear that there’s a new customer to serve or something another wants to tell you. For instance, there’s an early character who’s an eager knight placed under a curse. After one interaction, he sets back out into the forest to complete some task — but in my playthrough, he returned not even a minute later ready to push his own story further, a big yellow exclamation mark over his head as he rushed back toward me. The urgency of these sorts of interactions is entirely at odds with everything else in the game. There’s a meaningful friction in the narrative that makesWanderstopmemorable, but that friction isn’t replicated in the slightest with the gameplay. I can understand why, because adding that friction, be it simply through more time spent waiting or removing notification icons, risks players becoming frustrated and quitting. But it’s a friction that the game could have benefited from to better serveWanderstop’s unique framing.
This all comes back to the idea of dreaming about labor — or not. I don’t dream of labor within the system we live under now, but that doesn’t mean I don’t dream about labor at all. The future I dream of isn’t one without friction, but one that ensures a slower, happier life for my community, even if that means doing the work.Wanderstopfeels the most meaningful when it focuses on that.
Wanderstopwill be released March 11 on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. The game was reviewed on Steam Deck using a pre-release download code provided by Annapurna Interactive.

"Nintendo’s on the verge of a tricky console transition
byMichael McWhertor
This story was first published in Switchboard, a newsletter from Polygon that delivers all the latest Switch 2 news, reporting, and rumors directly to your inbox.Sign up hereto get it weekly.
Last week’sPokémon Presentswas more than a peek at what’s next for the Pokémon franchise. The showcase revealed new details on Switch gamesPokémon Legends: Z-AandPokémon Champions, but it also got to some of thebiggest questions about the future of the original Switch, including:
Nintendo has previously said that it’s working togive users a “smooth transition” from Switch to Switch 2, thanks to the widespread adoption of Nintendo Accounts. Depending on how smoothly that goes, the next-gen transition toSwitch 2should let Nintendo Account holders carry over their digital libraries, subscriptions, and personal information.
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has also said that the company is trying to produce as many Switch 2 units as possible for launch, both to meet consumer demand and deter resellers. The same is true on the software side; Nintendo is reportedly working to develop a robust launch lineup of exclusive games for Switch 2.
Nintendo has only a handful of first-party Switch games on its slate, includingMetroid Prime 4: BeyondandXenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, the latter of which drops this month. Whether the company has anything substantive in store for Switch 1 beyond those two titles is unclear; there have been persistent rumors that Nintendo’s sitting on various Legend of Zelda and Metroid Prime remasters for the original Switch, but Nintendo hasn’t confirmed any additional software for its current-gen console.
In February, Furukawa addressed the state of the Switch lineup going into 2025, but his response to questions about further games for the 8-year-old system was pretty open-ended.
“Since many people are playing Nintendo Switch, if we are able to develop appealing software, we would like to continue releasing new titles,” Furukawa said in translated remarks. “On the other hand, exclusive games are crucial when launching new hardware. With this in mind, we will consider various ways for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 to encourage as many consumers as possible to enjoy our games.”
For a look at what Nintendo might be planning in the future, we can look at its past.
When the original Switch was released in 2017, Nintendo was coming off the success of the 3DS and the failure of the Wii U. With more than 65 million 3DS systems in customers’ hands when the Switch launched, Nintendo wisely supported the 3D handheld for years into the Switch’s life with games likeMetroid: Samus ReturnsandWarioWare Gold.
It was a very different story for Wii U. With just 13 million of those consoles sold by 2017, Nintendo made a clean break; the final game it released for Wii U wasThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which launched concurrently with the Switch version.
The Switch being an instant hit (and Wii U practically dead) incentivized Nintendo to fully embrace the next generation back in 2017.
With more than 150 million Switch consoles sold to date, we can expect Nintendo to continue to cater to that platform’s existing audience, at least for a little while. There are still plenty of Wii U, 3DS, and GameCube-era games that could get upgraded Switch versions to keep the system humming along with “new” Nintendo games.
Nintendo has pledged backward compatibility for Switch games on Switch 2, so any future games released for the original Switch should be supported by its successor.
What’s less clear is Nintendo’s cross-generational strategybeyondbackward compatibility. Will the company release native Switch and Switch 2 versions of games likeMetroid Prime 4(à la previous cross-gen releasesTwilight PrincessandBreath of the Wild), or is the long-in-development Metroid game being built to play well on Switch and play better through backward compatibility on Switch 2? The latter seems more likely, or at least less complicated for Nintendo.
Nintendo certainly doesn’t want to fall into the trap that its console competitors have found themselves in this generation. Sony and Microsoft have supported the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One well into the life cycle of their successors, resulting in very few truly “next-gen” game experiences and a generation of consoles that never really felt like they had their moment.
So don’t expect Nintendo to support the original Switch for too long. Its focus seems clearly on Switch 2, and a clean break is likely coming soon. Maybe not in 2025, with a handful of Switch games still on the horizon — but soon enough to let Switch 2 stand on its own.
The best way to stay up to date on all things Nintendo Switch 2.
