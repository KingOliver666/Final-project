    "title": "825 Forest Road Review",
    "publishedAt": "2025-04-05T13:09:52Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/825-forest-road-review-shudder",
    "full_text": "825 Forest Road is now streaming on Shudder.\n\nWriter and director Stephen Cognetti is ready to be known as more than the “Hell House LLC Guy.” Unfortunately, his latest movie won’t help him accomplish that goal. 825 Forest Road ditches the found-footage Halloween scares of Cognetti’s directorial debut and its sequels for a more traditional approach to horror. Unfortunately, it's nowhere near as engaging or inventive as those four (and counting) trips to the cursed Abaddon Hotel. 825 Forest Road is a tangle of feeble lore, jumbled storytelling jumps, and an upsetting mannequin who’s scary, but can’t quite escape the shadow of the terrifyingly mobile clown dummies that stalk the Hell House movies.\nThe ingredients of his past success are all in place: 825 Forest Road brings a malevolent force and unsuspecting victims to the central location of the title. Chuck Wilson (Joe Falcone), his seamstress wife Maria (Elizabeth Vermilyea), and his artistic younger sister Isabelle (Kathryn Miller) leave tragedy behind to make a fresh start in the small town of Ashland Falls. But Ashland's darkest supernatural secret eventrually comes a-knocking at Chuck's front door: Her name is Helen Foster (Diomira Keane), and untimely deaths are her calling card. Cue the stock possession-horror thrills as the trio’s spacious yet surprisingly affordable home is infested by a vengeful spirit that Helen eventually channels into Maria's disturbing antique mannequin, \"Martha.\"\nThere’s no visual imagination to be found in 825 Forest Road. Ashland Falls is portrayed like any other humble American community, no different from the settings of the 50 other scrappy little haunted-house movies you’ll see this year. The character Cognetti brought to Hell House LLC's monstrous attraction doesn’t extend to 825 Forest Road, either – with its architectural stuffiness and generic production design, the house might as well be an unoccupied model in the middle of a new housing development. And without the found-footage hook, the filmmaking lacks pop, sucking the life out of Chuck's residential nightmare.\nCognetti also miscalculates the durability of his storytelling, splitting 825 Forest Road into three repetitive chapters focused on a different member of the family. We follow Chuck, Irene, and Maria as they interact with Helen throughout the same sorta-spooky events, but the momentum is choppy at best – nothing revealed along the way is thunderous enough to be rewound multiple times. Cognetti struggles to bring his concept to life, whether it's Helen's underbaked backstory or the counterintuitive motivations that peg Chuck's crew as mindless cannon fodder. A few valiant efforts are made to prop up the exposition – like introducing the town's underground paranormal discussion group – but if the devil's in the details, he's on vacation.\nI'll admit: Martha the mannequin – with her crackly,  papier-mâché complexion and habit of turning up where you least expect her – makes an effective antagonist. As Helen taunts the befuddled residents of 825 Forest Road by puppeting Martha around the house, Cognetti calls back to his nerve-shredding usage of Hell House LLC's bald-and-painted clown prop. The ghastly figure makes a good jump scare (when she’s not a shoddy digital effect), but 825 Forest Road is never scarier than when Martha gains mobility, scampering about like one of Donna Beneviento'sResident Evil Villageminions. So much of 825 Forest Road is a struggle, but not when Cognetti reminds us why Hell House LLC garnered a ravenous following addicted to blood-pumping terrors. If only the Martha material had a more powerful, lingering effect.\nThe rest of 825 Forest Road stumbles through the motions. The performances are a serviceable crop, but the cast doesn’t give you anything that'll stay seared in your memory. Cognetti recycles a few tricks from his Hell House LLC experiences, but they're less impactful without the intimacy found-footage can provide. Then there's the death blow of the final act, an anticlimax that fades to black at the worst possible moment. The kernel of an idea in 825 Forest Road never puffs into something tastier – it’s the hardened shell at the bottom of Cognetti’s bowl of savory found-footage frights. Perhaps the upcoming Hell House LLC: Lineage will prove a better method of closing the door on this chapter of his career.\n825 Forest Road is an unimposing ghost story that resembles a first draft begging for revisions. Hell House LLC director Stephen Cognetti is able to string a few solid scares together here, but overall, his first feature-length excursion beyond the grounds of the Abaddon Hotel is a forgettable bore. There's nothing vital or remarkable about this run-of-the-mill haunted-house movie – its spirit-conjuring villain, Helen Foster, deserves better, frankly. You'll get your kicks from a manic mannequin come to life, but those moments have all the fleeting adrenaline rush of a pinprick."

    "title": "How to Watch My Hero Academia in Order",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-31T21:58:32Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/my-hero-academia-anime-and-movies-in-order",
    "full_text": "My Hero Academia came out at the perfect time, releasing just a couple of years before Infinity War, at the height of superhero dominance of pop culture. While Marvel movies were delivering world-ending stakes, the simplicity and relatively small scope of My Hero Academia felt new and refreshing even if it was familiar — especially to anyone who watched Sky High in the mid-'00s. The show is just a very effective battle shonen with everything you'd expect from a series in the genre, including memorable characters, themes about friendship and self-improvement, a sense of escalation, and stunning animation.\n\nBut most importantly, the show has an interesting portrayal of a world of heroes where superpowers impact every single aspect of culture and society. Like most shonen, there is plenty of supplementary material, like movies and original video animation (OVAs) and even spin-offs that expand the world of the anime. Whether you're just getting into the show or you want to see what you've missed along the way, here's how to watch My Hero Academia (including the movies) in order.\nAdapting Kōhei Horikoshi's manga of the same name, My Hero Academia has been airing for seven seasons across almost a whole decade. In addition to the main show, there have been nine OVA's that expand the story, either with silly little side stories or adaptations of one-shot manga, as well as four movies.My Hero Academia: Vigilantes, which just started airing, is the first and only anime spin-off so far.\nHow about canon, though? Well, anything that doesn't directly adapt the manga, like the movies and most of the OVAs, aren't technically canon. Sure, they're fun and the movies do often tease some new power-up that is to come in the anime later on, but they're not necessary to the story.\nAlmost everything MHA, including every season of the show, most of the OVAs, and all four movies, is streaming on Crunchyroll. Thebest anime streaming service, Crunchyroll offers anad-supported free tieras well as aseven-day free trialof its Premium membership, which starts at $7.99/month. In the U.S., all seven seasons of My Hero Academia are streaming on Hulu, while the first four seasons are on Netflix. The My Hero Academia movies are also available as physical releases.\nYou can also check out our guide onhow to read My Hero Academia chapters onlineas well asIGN's reviews of individual My Hero Academia episodes.\nThe first My Hero Academia OVA that was released feels like a blast from the past, an episode that is entirely about the students of class 1A and the teachers reeling from the USJ Incident from the first season. Now, the students are finally set to resume training, and they make groups as they are assigned to rescue each other, then face a fight against a villain.\nBecause the episode was only released in Japan at the annual Jump Festa fan convention celebrating the various Shōnen manga magazines, the OVA is full of funny fourth-wall breaks and nods to the audience.\nTeacher Aizawa is a little bit unorthodox. In this second OVA, he decides to throw his students headfirst into a training exercise with students from the Isamu Academy High School – which spirals out of control when one of the students (named Romero in a touching tribute to the father of modern zombies) uses his Quirk and turns a whole bunch of people into zombies. What was meant to be a simple exercise about survival turns into a proper zombie apocalypse. The OVA has some hilarious moments like seeing the panic in Deku's eyes when he sees All Might in his weakened state, only for everyone to think he's a zombie.\nWhile this OVA could have technically kicked off the timeline, it's best enjoyed as a prologue to the Two Heroes movie it released alongside. This is as close as we got to a proper All Might prequel, and it is delightful to watch All Might rise from a grieving student who just lost his teacher to becoming the ever-smiling Symbol of Peace we know and love.\nThefirst My Hero Academia moviesets the winning formula that would follow in every movie in the franchise since. What starts out as a fun getaway vacation where Deku accompanies All Might to visit an old friend of the hero ends up as a big test to Deku as the floating island is taken hostage by a villain. This is the movie for All Might fans as we learn a bit more of his origin and his time in America.\nWhy does every Class 1-A training exercise end in disaster? This time around, the entire abandoned mall that the teacher decided to set this training in starts to collapse and the training exercise quickly becomes a fight for survival. These episodes are really for those who don't like that the main story moved away from the school part of the story too quickly, and delivers the kind of Saturday Morning Cartoon-type school shenanigans of the earlier seasons.\nThis is by far my favorite My Hero Academia movie to date.Heroes Risingshowcases Class 1-A working together as proper heroes without relying on a mentor, a cool location, and also a cameo from the best hero, Godzillo. Most importantly, this movie is a treat for Bakugo and Deku fans, giving us more insight into their relationship and dynamic. It also has the best climax of any of the movies by having Deku and Bakugo work together and deliver a phenomenal joint attack.\nThis is another short OVA, and one that actually adapts a one-shot from the manga. It is mostly a comedy sketch about Hawks that ties into the next movie, but what makes it stand out is its stunning animation.\nThis movie has the highest stakes of the movies up to this point and a cool visual style, but what really makesWorld Heroes' Missionspecial is the introduction of best boy, Rody. He instantly becomes one of the best characters in the franchise and seeing his dynamic with Deku is fantastic. Timeline-wise, this is the one place My Hero Academia gets a bit funky, as the anime deviates from the manga.\nWhat if our favorite heroes had to stop a criminal whose power made everyone around him laugh uncontrollably? That's the simple but sweet premise of this OVA, which is one of the funniest episodes of My Hero Academia. The villain is essentially a Joker type who makes everyone laughs and he is a treat to watch, even if the episode itself doesn't offer much that we hadn't seen before.\nA baseball episode! A classic trope of the anime medium, and one that My Hero Academia does spectacularly. Sure, there are few surprises to be had, but that's fine, because the fun is just watching the wild display of Quirks used for something as mundane as a sports match.\nWhat if My Hero Academia turned into Yu-Gi-Oh? Bored during Winter Break and sequestered in their dorms, the 1-A students pass the time by playing a new heroes card game. It's essentially an excuse to show the characters battle each other (in a VR recreation of the card characters battling it out), but it is great \"what if\" fun – like seeing All Might fight… a dog.\nDeku is a huge hero nerd, that much audiences have known from the start, but sometimes the anime seems to forget about it. That's where A Piece of Cake comes from, adapting a one-shot manga that's all about the 1-A students discovering Deku's journal with extensive notes about their Quirks, and having wild reactions to his tips, suggestions, and silly drawings. It's a fun rest in what's otherwise a rather bleak chapter in the story, and a fun side story where the kids get to be kids (possibly for the last time).\nThelatest My Hero Academia moviehas some jaw-dropping visuals and a great final fight. The story introduces fascinating characters, including an anti-All Might villain as well as a new protagonist that has great chemistry with our main heroes.\nMy Hero Academia is reaching its end. Thefinal season of the showwill begin airing this October, but for those who aren't ready to let go of this universe, fret not. There are bound to be more OVAs or movies in the future.\nIn the meantime, we do have the spin-off series, Vigilantes, to enjoy. The My Hero Academia spin-off takes place five years before the events of the main series, has a darker and more mature tone, and features appearances by some fan-favorite characters.The first episode of My Hero Academia: Vigilantes is now streaming, and the season will consist of 13 episodes total.\nRafael Motamayor is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything anime and animation."

    "title": "Warfare Review",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-28T13:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/warfare-review-alex-garland-will-poulter-noah-centineo",
    "full_text": "Based on an actual incident from the Iraq War, Warfare is an especially effective and visceral depiction of modern combat. Only those who were there can say whether it’s a 100% realistic recreation of those events: Co-directors Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza have been careful to note that the grueling images they’ve put onscreen are the “memories” of Mendoza and his fellow U.S. Navy SEALs, who were trapped in a Ramadi apartment during a surveillance mission gone awry in 2006. Memories, of course, can be skewed or have their own gaps or inaccuracies. But there’s no arguing that the recollections dramatized by Warfare are undeniably engrossing – no matter how difficult and upsetting they are to watch. And they are difficult and upsetting to watch: Warfare is arguably among the most extreme “war is hell” movies ever made by an American studio.\n\nAfter spending the past decade working as an advisor on projects including Jurassic World, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Garland’s 2024 filmCivil War, Mendoza brings an uncommon level of personal experience to Warfare. Garland’s filmmaking prowess is crucial here as well: Part of what makes Warfare so effective is how it plays (and sounds) like the kind of blunt, dread-filled horror movie the28 Days Laterscreenwriter andAnnihilationdirector made his name on.\nAfter a quiet set up, all hell eventually breaks loose for Ray (played onscreen byReservation Dogs’ D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai) and his platoonmates. And when it does, things get truly horrifying. Warfare shows that no matter how well trained and skilled you are, there’s no controlling the chaos of an armed ambush or your reaction to a nearby explosion. The moment when things truly turn sideways for the group is absolutely brutal, filled with disturbing imagery of the dead and terribly injured and the shock on the faces of those who survive.\nIf this doesn’t exactly sound like the type of fun or excitement we might typically seek from a night at the multiplex – well, it’s not. Warfare is the type of technically impressive – and well worth seeing – movie that’s challenging by design. The idea is to put you in these men’s shoes as best as a movie can. In this regard, Warfare has an impact that I found hard to shake.\nEssentially told in real time, and mostly set within a single building, the methodically-paced build-up shows the SEALs – played by familiar faces from various MCU projects, celebrated FX series, Netflix dramas and more – hunkered down in the apartment they’ve commandeered from an Iraqi family. Scenes of them handwriting notes, urinating in water bottles, and stretching after long spells of crouching behind a sniper rifle accomplish Warfare’s goals of immersion. These lived in, mundane, and even tedious early moments play out in the ever-present shadow of lethal danger – and the fear that, any moment, a bullet (or bullets) could come flying into the apartment.\nThat nerve-rattling atmosphere is intensified by Warfare’s incredible sound design. Devoid of any musical score, the combat scenes go sonically wild and surreal: Sound designer Glenn Freemantle drops the volume low and the audio becomes distorted when the characters can barely hear, but there are also moments that are so loud, it’s almost too much to endure. And that’s clearly the point: Eventually, one of our main characters, having been injured in a particular ghastly manner, begins screaming at the top of their lungs in nonstop agony, and it’s nearly unbearable. But it’s also necessary to get across what these people are suffering through.\nWhen it comes to depicting the Iraqi civilians caught in the middle of all this, there issometime spent with the two scouts accompanying the SEALs on their mission, who express their rational, validated fears about what could occur. Warfare doesn’t shy away from the stark reality of how awful and traumatizing things are for the family living in the apartment, either. These people have the terrible luck of living in a place taken over by American soldiers who show no outward hesitation when it comes to endangering innocent lives – children included. With those soldiers providing our main point of view, it’s frustrating that we don’t get to know the family in any detail, or truly explore their viewpoint. Still, it’s clear that Mendoza and Garland are aware that for the inhabitants of the apartment, the SEALs themselves are like something out of a horror movie, and they don’t attempt to sugarcoat it.\nCasting here is crucial. These are simply defined characters without a trace of backstory or motivation, and Warfare asks us to invest in themquickly. Garland and Mendoza do a terrific job, stocking their cast with recognizable, up-and-coming, acclaimed actors like Will Poulter, Noah Centineo, Cosmo Jarvis, Kit Connor, Michael Gandolfini and Joseph Quinn. (Though there is some irony that many of these actors are, like Garland, Brits telling a deeply, unfortunately American story.) They’re able to convey the humanity and vulnerability within these guys – and let us understand, for instance, why someone who is usually clearly very capable suddenly freezes up in the face of such overwhelming odds. Charles Melton is also well cast as the leader of a second group of SEALs we meet later on, exuding the determination and gravitas this character needs to provide.\nWarfare is the kind of film where you’re sitting holding your breath, tensed up, for much of the run time. (94 minutes, in case you’re wondering whether or not it’ll be too much to endure.) Which means the rare moments of comic relief – including one darkly funny moment of accidental physical comedy in the midst of chaos – have all the more impact, thanks to the necessary release of tension. It’s easy to imagine this was the case for the characters’ real-life inspirations, too. Because if war is hell, you take a chuckle where you can get it.\nA darkly effective sensory overload, Warfare does a strong, stripped-down job of placing us into the midst of a notably intense and confined few hours of surveillance and combat. A strong cast of rising stars sells their characters’ mixture of fear and determination, while phenomenal sound design plays a big role in the immersiveness as we’re given a window into just how nightmarish and disorienting a combat experience like this can be."

    "title": "In Mortal Kombat 1, the T-1000 Has a Skeleton, Intestines, a Heart, and A… Soul?",

    "full_text": "Mortal Kombat 1’s T-1000 update has added the iconic Terminator 2 villain to the fighting game, and with it revealed how the developers at NetherRealm have handled its liquid metal form in the face of the series’ trademark Fatalities.\n\nThe gory fighting game franchise is famous for slicing and dicing characters in all sorts of gruesome ways, ripping out organs and even complete skeletons. Some characters tear the very soul from their hapless foe’s body, or break bones every which way possible.\nBut none of this should work on the T-1000, right? The T-1000 is made entirely out of a liquid metal called mimetic polyalloy, meaning it can reform into any shape it touches of the approximate size. And that’s exactly how the T-1000 works in Mortal Kombat 1, with his moveset, Fatalities, and Brutalities all in keeping with the character’s movie rules.\nOf course, when it comes to damage being done to T-1000 in the game, some of those rules had to be broken. But as players have discovered, the developers at NetherRealm have done a fantastic job creating a custom look for the T-1000 when it’s on the receiving end of Fatalities and other devastating attacks.\nX / Twitter user@daehnnypublished a series of videos showing how the T-1000 reacts to being torn to pieces. We see that in Mortal Kombat 1, the T-1000 melts as it does in the movies.\nMileena will eat anything!pic.twitter.com/FNkvtKFRut\nBut we also see that in Mortal Kombat 1, the T-1000 has a skeleton of sorts and even an intestine. And, not to get too philosophical, but in the world of Mortal Kombat 1, the T-1000 has a soul.\nBut he does have a soul!pic.twitter.com/nDexvb6RVN\nThere are some cool visuals at play here, with a dissolve effect for the T-1000 that makes the character look a little more unique than it would otherwise.\nI like how the skeleton dissolves in the endpic.twitter.com/w53f00DGlu\nApparently Quan Chi spells work on any kind of machinepic.twitter.com/DdJxYmB2BQ\nAnd yes, it turns out even the relentless T-1000 has a heart.\nTurns out even he is capable of loving. T-1000 has a heart#confirmedpic.twitter.com/KilRsllwam\nThere are also unique effects for when the T-1000 is on the receiving end of a Fatal Blow, and we see the character turn to liquid form when it's \"dead,\" which is a cool detail.\nand this is how the Fatalities look:he turns completely silver when he’s supposed to be dead, such a neat detailpic.twitter.com/Z3KTMhbTD8\nOf course, none of these Fatalities and Fatal Blows would actually kill the T-1000 were Mortal Kombat 1 playing by the rules established by the films. But then, Mortal Kombat 1 has never really made much sense. It’s about over-the-top, laugh-out-loud violence, and there’s no reason the T-1000 shouldn’t get in on the fun.\nMeanwhile, Mortal Kombat 1 players have been working out the T-1000’s Brutalities, and there are some cool Easter eggs in there, as well as references to Terminator 2 itself.\nSpamming some input will turn T-1000 into liquid form after brutality, I'm unsure of the input but i managed to trigger it a few times.@thethiny@iScreamFGC@interlokopic.twitter.com/BJEueaOKLN\nT-1000 is the final DLC character in the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about the 5 million-selling Mortal Kombat 1’s success.\nParent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things,the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat.\nAnd just this week, NetherRealm offered a first look at skins based on the Mortal Kombat 2 movie that are coming to Mortal Kombat 1 at some point in the future.\nHere's is a sneak peek at the MK2 movie skins in Mortal Kombat 1 🐉Koming later this year.pic.twitter.com/51Bkq6wGbX\nIn September, Mortal Kombat development chiefEd Boon said NetherRealm had decided on its next game three years prior, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "full_text": "Kirby has been a steadfast Nintendo mascot for 33 years, ever since the character debuted in 1992’s Kirby’s Dream Land for Game Boy. In addition to being a Smash Bros. staple, Kirby and his ever-evolving powers of inhalation have starred in over two dozen games, culminating in the series’ best-selling game to date, Kirby and the Forgotten Land.\n\nAs we near the end of Nintendo’s current console generation, we’ve compiled a list of every Kirby game on the Switch as well asnew Kirby gamescoming to the Switch 2.\nSix Kirby games have been released on Nintendo Switch, while 11 more retro Kirby games are playable withNintendo Switch Online. The franchise debuted on Switch in 2018 with Kirby Star Allies; its latest release, Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe, arrived in 2023. A new Kirby game,Kirby Air Riders, will be releasing for theNintendo Switch 2in 2025.\nKirby’s Switch debut came in 2018 withKirby Star Allies. The action-platformer is played with a party of four (multiplayer or local AI) and sees Kirby combine abilities with allies to solve puzzles and enhance combat.\nSeries developer HAL Laboratories and Nintendo brought the pink puff back the following year for the free-to-playSuper Kirby Clash. Like Star Allies, Clash is played with a team of four that can be controlled by other human players or AI. Unlike Star Allies, this is not a platformer but rather a standalone boss rush mode; it features a hub world for changing equipment and selecting quests, though the heart of the game is the series of boss fights that serve as those quests.\nA sequel to the 3DS game Kirby Fighters Deluxe (an expanded version of the subgame Kirby Fighters found in Kirby: Triple Deluxe),Kirby Fighters 2is exactly what it sounds like: a fighting game starring Kirby. It supports up to four players and features Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede, Bandana Waddle Dee, Gooey, and Magolor as playable characters.\nThe series’ standout game on Switch,Kirby and the Forgotten Landis a post-apocalyptic adventure in which Kirby gets sucked into a wormhole that appears above Dream Land. The Forgotten Land is the series’ first fully 3D platformer, complete with puzzles and Kirby’s signature ability-based combat. It’s the series’ best-selling game to date, selling more than 7.5 million copies by the end of March 2024. There's even a Switch 2 version of this game currentlylisted to be available for preorder.\nKirby’s Dream Buffetis a dessert-themed multiplayer game released in 2022. It features three four-player game modes: race, minigame, and battle royale. The modes can be played separately or together as part of Dream Buffet’s Gourmet Grand Prix.\nThe series’ latest game,Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxeis a remake of the 2011 Wii game Kirby’s Return to Dream Land. The action-platformer came to Switch with improved visuals, a new easy mode (Helper Magolor), three new abilities (Sand, Mecha, and Festival), and an all-new two-hour adventure called Magolor Epilogue: The Interdimensional Traveler.\nReturn to Dream Land Deluxe supports local co-op for up to four players, with each player taking control of either Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede, or Bandana Waddle Dee.\nThere are 11 Kirby games available with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Those with a regular subscription can play nine Kirby games from NES, SNES, and Game Boy, while those with the more expensive Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription get access to two additional games: Kirby & The Amazing Mirror (GBA) and Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards (N64).\nHere’s the list of Kirby games playable with Nintendo Switch Online, ordered by initial release date:\nAnew GameCube librarywill also be available in the NSO + Expansion Pack membership on Switch 2, which may include Kirby Air Ride.\n\nThe era of Kirby on Switch may be coming to a close, but the character's journey on the Switch 2 has just begun.Kirby Air Riderswas officially announced during theApril 2025 Nintendo Directas a follow-up to the 2003Kirby Air Ride racing gameon GameCube.

The R-rated action comedy stars Quaid as a man who feels no pain, so it's starting to seem like 'The Boys' veteran goes out of his way to get covered in fake blood.\n\nIn herreview for IGN,critic Lena Wilson states that “Novocaine offers more depth than its gimmicky 'man who feels no pain' premise may lead you to believe,\" with \"clever storytelling and character writing that reminds us of a time when seeing movies in theaters was just plain fun.”\nIf you're planning to catch Novocaine in theaters or want a sense of when the movie will be available to stream, check out the details below.\nNovocaine just released in theaters.

    "full_text": "Scarlet Witch actress Elizabeth Olsen has suggested she will not be in eitherAvengers: Secret WarsorAvengers: Doomsday.\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe fans had hoped to see The Scarlet Witch return following the events ofDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.\nWarning!Spoilers for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Agatha All Along Season 1 follow.\nScarlet Witch apparently died at the end of the 2022 MCU film andfailed to make a dramatic return in Disney+ show Agatha All Along, much to the disappointment of fans.Olsen had saidshe’d be up for playing Scarlet Witch once again, “if there’s a good way to use her.”\nThen,MCU boss Kevin Feige issued a tease that got Scarlet Witch fans excited. “We had Agatha Forever on Disney+ just now, and that series was great for us,” he said. “Since then, there have been a lot of questions about Wanda on fans' minds... So all I can say is that we're excited to find out when and how the Scarlet Witch might return.”\nIf that return to the MCU does happen, it apparently won’t be in Avengers. Speaking toThe Hollywood Reporter, Olsen insisted she won’t be in London for the filming of the Russo brothers’ two upcoming Avengers movies, Doomsday and Secret Wars.\nWhy? She wants to focus on her non-Marvel movies right now. Doomsday and Secret Wars will soon start shooting in London via back-to-back productions, whereas Olsen is about to film a pilot for FX drama Seven Sisters.\nIs this a ruse? Could Olsen be offering a diversion in her response to The Hollywood Reporter’s question? It wouldn’t be the first misleading misdirection from a member of the MCU’s cast. Perhaps everyone wants Scarlet Witch’s involvement in Avengers to be a big surprise if and when it happens, and ruling it out in interviews will help.\nHere’s what we know: Iron Man actorRobert Downey Jr. is set to return as Doctor Doom, andBenedict Cumberbatch returns as Doctor Strange in Secret Wars. Elsewhere, we have vague rumblings about who will turn up in the film, with everyone from The Fantastic Four to the Thunderbolts rumored to be in the cast.\nAll eyes will be on London to see which MCU stars are in town when the filming takes place. Expect plenty more reports from eagle-eyed fans to hit the internet in the coming months.\nThe MCU rumbles on regardless.Thunderbolts*comes out in May 2025, TV showIronheartis out in June, and Phase 6 kicks off withThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsin July.\nEarlier this month,the Russo brothers said they see Avengers 5 and 6 as a “new beginning”that will lay the foundation for whatever comes next in Phase 7 of the MCU.\n“The only thing I’ll say about the movie is this: we love villains who think they’re the heroes of their own stories,” Joe Russo said. “That’s when they become three-dimensional and they become more interesting. When you have an actor like Robert Downey, you have to create a three-dimensional, well shaped character for the audience. That’s where a lot of our focus is going.”\nAvengers: Doomsday is currently set to arrive in theaters May 1, 2026 and Secret Wars arrives about a year later in May 2027.\nLate last year, Feige teased the introduction of X-Men characters in the \"next few\" MCU movies. Feige told an audience at the Disney APAC Content Showcase in Singapore that fans would see “some X-Men players that you might recognize” in the next few MCU movies, but he stopped short of saying which characters or what movies.\nOn bringing the X-Men into the MCU, Feige added: “I think you will see that continues in our next few movies with some X-Men players that you might recognize.\n“Right after that, the whole story of Secret Wars really leads us into a new age of mutants and of the X-Men. Again, [it’s] one of those dreams come true. We finally have the X-Men back.”\nFeige has also said the X-Men will be an important part of the MCU’s future following Secret Wars. \"When we were preparing for Avengers: Endgame years ago, it was a question of getting to the grand finale of our narrative, and then we had to start all over again after that,” Feige said. “This time, on the road to Secret Wars, we already know very well what the story is going to be until then and afterwards. The X-Men are an important part of that future.”\nIn October, Marvel Studios added three untitled movie projects to its 2028 release schedule: February 18, 2028; May 5, 2028; and November 10, 2028. It seems increasingly likely one of these movies is X-Men.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

    "full_text": "The future of the MCU is starting to take shape. DirectorsAnthony and Joe Russohave teased howAvengers: DoomsdayandAvengers: Secret Warswill differ from their last two projects in the franchise, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.\n\nDuring an interview with Brazilian outletOmelete, the directing brothers revealed that they see Avengers 5 and 6 as a “new beginning” that will lay the foundation for whatever comes next in Phase 7 of the MCU.\n\"The greatest thing that ever happened is we got to get immersed in a 20 movie arc and see an ending to that arc,\" Joe Russo said. \"What's compelling about these two new Avengers movies is they're a beginning. It's a new beginning. We told an ending story [with Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame] and now we're going to tell a beginning story. Who knows where we’ll go from there?\"\nThe pair also opened up about how they ended up back in the Marvel world tackling another Avengers story. “We didn’t know what our road forward was in the MCU after we finished Endgame,” Anthony Russo explained.\n“What happened was, a creative idea just came to us and that ended up feeling like the right idea. It motivated us to do it again. We feel like we have something fresh, we feel like we have a story that’s important and needs to be told. We have an amazing group of collaborators again, some old and some new. We’re very excited.\"\nHe also noted that Doomsday is a “difficult” movie because of the “expectations on it” to help bring theatergoing back to its pre-pandemic glory. That said, the Russos also revealed it was Marvel producer Kevin Feige’s ideato bring Robert Downey Jr. back for Doomsday.\n“That conversation was had a while ago, and Robert tried to talk us into doing it and we said no,” Joe said. “We just didn’t have a story, we didn’t have a way in, so we were resistant for a while. And then one day, [Endgame writer] Steve McFeely called us and said, ‘I have an idea.’ ”\n“The only thing I’ll say about the movie is this: we love villains who think they’re the heroes of their own stories,” Joe Russo closed out the interview. “That’s when they become three-dimensional and they become more interesting. When you have an actor like Robert Downey, you have to create a three-dimensional, well shaped character for the audience. That’s where a lot of our focus is going.”\nAvengers: Doomsday is currently set to arrive in theaters May 1, 2026 and Secret Wars arrives about a year later in May 2027, so unfortunately, we’ve got a lot of waiting to do before we can see what the Russo brothers are cooking up.\nLate last year, Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige teased the introduction of X-Men characters in the \"next few\" MCU movies.\nFeige told an audience at the Disney APAC Content Showcase in Singapore that fans would see “some X-Men players that you might recognize” in the next few MCU movies, but he stopped short of saying which characters or what movies.\nOn bringing the X-Men into the MCU, Feige added: “I think you will see that continues in our next few movies with some X-Men players that you might recognize.\n“Right after that, the whole story of Secret Wars really leads us into a new age of mutants and of the X-Men.

The X-Men are an important part of that future.”\nIt sounds like Phase 7 of the MCU will be dominated by the X-Men, then, but in the short term, Storm appeared inWhat If...? Season 3, marking the character’s first appearance in the wider MCU.\nIn October, Marvel Studios added three untitled movie projects to its 2028 release schedule: February 18, 2028; May 5, 2028; and November 10, 2028.

    "title": "Captain America: Brave New World’s Real Budget? You’ll Never Know… and This Is Why",

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/captain-america-brave-new-world-real-budget-box-office",
    "full_text": "It’s no secret that the latest Marvel film,Captain America: Brave New World, didn’t exactly light the world on fire in terms ofcritical response, fan response, or box office. In fact, on the latter front some folks have been doom-watching as Brave New World limps along, making money each weekend since its release, but not really makingMCU money.\n\nThe thing about Hollywood movie budgets is it’s always difficult to track how much money actually went into a film. Yes, budgets will be cited by “studio insiders” and the like, but there’s no real way to know how accurate those figures are unless you’re a number-cruncher on the inside - in this case at Disney or Marvel. And sometimes damage control and image perception will impact the budgets that are reported. Damage control and image perception? In Hollywood? Who knew!\nIn the case of Captain America: Brave New World, which as of this writing has been out for four weekends and earned $371 million worldwide (according toBox Office Mojo), there was definitely damage control to do. Amid increasingdoom-and-gloom reportssurrounding the MCU overall, there’s also the apparentlytroubled production historyof the film to consider, which was said to include difficult test screenings, expensive reshoots, and even the addition of a new villain character (Giancarlo Esposito’s Sidewinder) to the plot.\nThe Brave New World budget that has beenreported by trade outletslike Variety and The Hollywood Reporter is$180 million, but that seems low considering the reported (at least)22 days of reshoots, and indeed, some well-sourced industry observers indicate that the final budget was significantly higher. According toThe Hot Mic, the budget was in the range of $300 million, while Joanna Robinson and Dave Gonzalez, who wrote the bookMCU: The Reign of Marvel Studios,have said their sourcespeg the movie as costing closer to $380 million. Bear in mind there’s also the matter of P&A (prints and advertising) costs, which would be in the tens of millions at the very least if not higher for an MCU blockbuster (Variety pegs P&A for Brave New World at$100 million). And then there’s the revenue split that the studio has to share with theater owners!\nSo take the $300 million figure as an example. If that was the total cost for Marvel, then the common wisdom in Hollywood bookkeeping is that the film would need to make $600 million before the studio has even broken even. That clearly will not happen in theaters as the film is slowing down substantially and nearing the end of its theatrical run.\nHere’s how Captain America: Brave New World currently ranks at the box office as compared to the highest- and lowest-grossing MCU movies.\nHighest Grossing Movies:\nLowest-Grossing Movies:\nNow all this said, things get much hazier when it comes to the value of having, say, Captain America: Brave New World always available as one of the titles on your streaming service. Or when you can keep selling merchandise based on these characters. Or when you’re setting them up for their next big Avengers movie, which is likely to make way more money than Brave New World has.\nThis is Hollywood magic, folks, only not the good kind. As underwhelming as the bulk of the post-Endgame MCU has been, there’s a safety net component to being part of a shared universe. It’s also why budgets vs. box office comparisons are both unknowable and not the real issue. While an MCU movie can tank, it still serves the purpose of keeping the series moving and hence is easier to excuse in the grand scheme of things. A standalone movie with no franchise ties, however, has to stand on its own two feet. This is why things are that much harder for the Mickey 17s of the world these days.\nIs releasing a stinker like Brave New World the cost of doing business for a shared universe mega-franchise these days? You gotta keep the factory line running, as Lucille Ball learned all those years ago. And if that means every now and then stuffing your face full of chocolate that you don’t really even want, at least you know it comes out in the wash in the end."

    "full_text": "Streamer Valkyrae’s cameo alongside other famous content creators was cut fromA Minecraft Movie, it was confirmed over the weekend. Addressing the situation, Valkyrae, real name Rachell Marie Hofstetter, told fans she would “much rather not have that 30 seconds than be sued.”\n\nLast year, Valkyrae namechecked A Minecraft Movie star Jason Momoa when asked for her “worst celebrity or streamer experience.”\nIn avideo interview, Valkyrae alleged: “I just saw him mistreat some of the crew. And it was pretty disappointing. It was after a very intense scene, and it was a very emotional scene, so maybe he was still in character. I don't know. But I just was surprised at how he treated some of the crew.\n“He was just really mad at them that they weren’t doing something right. It was setting up the shot and stuff, and he was angry, like really mad, and like yelling. So I was like, man, this is not a good work environment. I would not be happy working under these conditions.\n“I would have to say that was the worst celebrity thing I’ve seen.”\nFast forward to the weekend just gone andA Minecraft Movie’s record-breaking release, and Valkyrae’s cameo appears to have not made the cut, although some fans believe they have spotted a blink-and-you’ll miss glimpse at the streamer in the background of a certain shot.\nIn alivestream on Twitch, Valkyrae touched on the situation around A Minecraft Movie. She kept her cards close to her chest, dancing around the reason for her omission, but did confirm her cameo was meant to be 30 seconds long, and insisted its removal had nothing to do with Minecraft or the people behind it.\n“Let’s just say I’m not gonna touch too much on it,” Valkyrae began. “But as much as you guys saw the other creators that were in it, would have been the equal amounts that you saw me in it, which is like 30 seconds. So it’s okay.\n\"I would much rather not have that 30 seconds than be sued. So it’s all good, okay? It’s all good.\n“It really was a wonderful 10 days in New Zealand for that 30 seconds, and I’m really glad I got to visit New Zealand.\n“I feel like things could have been so much worse, you know what I mean? That’s all I’m going to say about it, okay. That’s all I’m going to say.\n“It’s not even Minecraft. It’s not even their fault. Don’t even worry. Don’t worry.”\nIGN has asked Warner Bros. Discovery for comment.\nThe upshot of all this is Valkyrae is not in A Minecraft Movie, which you’d imagine would have soured her on the film itself. Not so. “No, the movie did not suck,” she said on stream. “I thought it was good. I actually thought it was good.”\nWe’ve got plenty more on A Minecraft Movie, includinghow rowdy fans are creating wild scenes in the cinema, causing some to say it’s ruining their experience.\nIGN’sA Minecraft Movie reviewreturned a 6/10. We said: “Napoleon Dynamite director Jared Hess puts a surprisingly specific and funny comic spin on A Minecraft Movie’s kid-friendly adventure, especially in its less antic first half.”\nIf you’ve seen the film, be sure to check out IGN’sA Minecraft Movie Ending and Post-Credits Scene ExplainedWith Director Jared Hess and Minecraft's Torfi Frans Ólafsson.\nPhoto by Gregg DeGuire/Variety via Getty Images.

    "full_text": "Tim Burton may not have directed a Batman movie in over 30 years, but his DC Universe is still going strong. Michael Keaton got the chance to reprise the Bruce Wayne role in 2023’s The Flash, a movie that (briefly) ported his Batman over to the DCEU. But even now, the Burton-Verse continues to expand through new comic book and novel spinoffs likethe recently announced Batman: Revolution.\n\nIt’s gotten to the point where the question of how to watch and read the entire Burton-Verse is a surprisingly complicated one. But don’t worry, we’re here to help. Read on for a full breakdown of how the various Tim Burton Batman movies, novels, and comics fit together.\nYou can also check out our full guide towatching all the Batman movies in order.\nCounting the yet-to-be-released Batman: Revolution, there are currently seven projects set in Burton’s Batman universe - three films, two novels, and two comics. That lineup includes 1989’s Batman, 1992’s Batman Returns, and 2023’s The Flash, as well as the books Batman: Resurrection and Batman: Revolution and the comics Batman ‘89 and Batman ‘89: Echoes.\nThis lineup also excludes 1995’s Batman Forever and 1997’s Batman & Robin, which are no longer considered to be part of Burton’s Batman universe. We’ll get into the reasons why a bit later.\nAlthough you can stream Burton’s Batman movies on Max and read the Batman ‘89 comics on DC Universe Infinite, it never hurts to go the physical media route these days. If you’re looking to buy the Burton-Verse movies and books, here are some good options:\n*Each blurb contains a broad overview of the plot and mentions the heroes/villains who appear in that film or book.\nThis is the original movie that started it all. Burton’s first Batman movie pits Michael Keaton’s Dark Knight (still early in his superhero career) against Jack Nicholson’s Joker. The movie inspired a summer of “Bat-Mania” and proved there was a healthy appetite for darker, more mature superhero movies in Hollywood.\nThis novel by John Jackson Miller is set in the aftermath of the first movie, as Batman deals with the remnants of the Joker Gang and confronts the rise of the shape-shifting villain known as Clayface. The book is designed to bridge the gap between Batman and Batman Returns, including introducing Christopher Walken’s character Max Shreck and giving readers more insight into the collapse of Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale’s (Kim Basinger) romance.\nMiller is returning for a second novel set between the events of Batman and Batman Returns. This time, Revolution will introduce the Burton-Verse’s version of Riddler, a lowly newspaper copy editor named Norman Pinkus who laments the fact that no one appreciates his aptitude for solving crimes. Pinkus will turn to a life of crime and capitalize on the city’s growing resentment toward the wealthy elite of Gotham.\nBurton and Keaton both returned for this film sequel, which is set a few years after the events of the first movie. This time, Batman goes up against Michelle Pfeiffer’s Catwoman and Danny DeVito’s Penguin as Gotham City endures a hellish holiday season. Despite initial plans for a third Batman movie, both Burton and Keaton ultimately dropped out of what became 1995’s Batman Forever.\nDC’s Batman ‘89 comic serves as a direct sequel to Batman Returns and is set three years later. The six-issue comic, written by Batman screenwriter Sam Hamm and illustrated by Joe Quinones, draws inspiration from Burton’s abandoned plans for a third Batman movie. The book sees Billy Dee Williams’ Harvey Dent become Two-Face, while also introducing a version of Robin modeled after Marlon Wayans (who at one point was attached to play the role in Batman Returns). Michelle Pfeiffer’s Catwoman also makes a return appearance, paying off on the tease from the end of Batman Returns.\nClick here to learn more about how Batman ‘89 adds to the Burton-Verse.\nJust as Batman ‘89 is essentially Burton’s Batman 3 in comic form, Hamm and Quinones reunited for a follow-up that acts as a hypothetical fourth Burton movie. Three years after the events of Batman ‘89, Keaton’s Bruce Wayne has gone missing, leaving Robin and the new Batgirl to deal with the threat posed by Scarecrow (modeled after Jeff Goldblum) and Harley Quinn (modeled after Madonna).\nWhile only hardcore Burton-Verse completionists need to worry about this one, it's worth mentioning that Robert Wuhl briefly reprises the role of intrepid reporter Alexander Knox in the first chapter of The CW's Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover. That episode briefly shifts focus to Earth-89, where Knox is seen reading a newspaper in a park as red skies form over Gotham. It's one ofnumerous live-action DC cameos in the crossover.\nWhile it didn’t fare well critically or commercially, The Flash at least has the distinction of giving Bat-fans some closure on the saga of Keaton’s Batman. Keaton himself returns to play a much older Bruce Wayne, after Ezra Miller’s Barry Allen mucks about with the DCEU timeline and inadvertently trades one Batman for another. Meeting The Flash and learning about the threat of Michael Shannon’s General Zod is enough to coax Batman out of retirement for one last, high-stakes mission.\n1995’s Batman Forever and 1997’s Batman & Robin were once considered sequels to Batman and Batman Returns, despite the fact that neither Burton nor Keaton returned for these projects. The presence of supporting characters like Pat Hingle’s Commissioner Gordon and Michael Gough’s Alfred maintained some degree of continuity with the previous films. However, these two sequels are generally regarded as being inferior to their predecessors, as well as being far different tonally.\nWith the release of The Flash, DC now officially treats Batman Forever and Batman & Robin as being set in a separate version of the DC Universe. The Batman ‘89 comics now act as the definitive, canon sequels to Batman Returns, revealing what happened to Keaton’s Bruce Wayne between the events of Returns and The Flash.\nWarning:this section contains spoilers for The Flash!\nThe Flash wasn’t always intended to be the end of the road for Keaton’s Batman. At one point, the character was being positioned for an ongoing role in the DCEU (before WB cut that cinematic universe’s future short). Reportedly,a previous version of the movieended not with Batman dying in battle against Zod in the Flashpoint timeline, but with both Keaton’s Bruce and Sasha Calle’s Supergirl crossing over into the restored DCEU. That’s where WB’s canceled Batgirl movie comes in.\nKeaton wound up reprising the role again in Batgirl, which reportedly cast him as an aged, Batman Beyond-esque mentor to Leslie Grace’s rookie Barbara Gordon. J.K. Simmons also returned as the DCEU Commissioner Gordon, while Brendan Fraser played the villain Firefly.\nThe Batgirl movie made it well into post-production beforeWB infamously pulled the plug and canceled it as a tax writeoff. It became a major casualty in the studio’s evolving plans for the DC line and the pivot toJames Gunn and Peter Safran’s DCU. Barring any major leaks, Keaton fans will never have an opportunity to see what will likely be his final Batman performance.\nFor more on the future of DC movies, find outwhy Gunn needs to keep Robert Pattinson’s Batman out of the DCUand brush up onevery DC movie and series in development.\nJesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

    "publishedAt": "2025-04-01T20:29:40Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/the-one-piece-film-red-4k-steelbook-movie-deal-april-2025",
    "full_text": "One Piece as a franchise has been getting a lot of extra attention lately. There's thelive-action versionof the show on Netflix, some highly anticipatedLEGO One Piece sets, and even a recentcollaboration with the NBA. Whether you're new to the series or have been around since the very beginning, there's never been a better time to be all-in on One Piece, especially with new episodes arriving next week as the animereturns from its six-month hiatus.\n\nWhile the series seemingly has an endless amount of episodes – more than 1,000 to be more precise – One Piece has no shortage of movies either. The latest film in the franchise, One Piece: Red, was released back in 2022, but Amazon has only recently dropped the price of the 4K steelbook to a reasonable price. You can also find the same deal at the Crunchyroll store right now.\nSince this steelbook was first available on Amazon, it has notdropped below $29.79as its lowest ever price. The discount that is happening now is largely thanks to theCrunchyroll storeoffering a price reduction alongside theCrunchyroll Anime Awardsthat are starting in April. If you're hoping to add this steelbook to your One Piece collection, right now is the best time to do so.\nOne Piece Film: Red is the most recent movie in the series and probably not the best place for a newcomer to jump right in. There are are actually a total of 15 One Piece movies in the franchise and they all fit in various points in the timeline. This particular movie takes place after episode 1030 on theOne Piece timeline, so you have a long ways to go if you're just starting on The Romance Dawn Arc. If you're ready to start the ultimate anime marathon, One Piece is available on pretty much everyanime streaming site, includingCrunchyroll.\nIGN reviewed the latest One Piece movie when it first came out. We like it enough to give it a 9 out of 10 in our review. Here's a quick breakdown of what we thought of the film:\n\"One Piece Film: Red breaks the mold of the typical anime shonen film, capturing the magic of the series. It’s confidently a musical, too, with J-Pop star Ado providing several fantastic earworms as Uta Shanks doesn’t get as much screen time as fans may hope, but it’s still satisfying to spend more time with him. It’s not the movie that will convert non-believers into fans – it feels more like a lost episode than a cash grab for newcomers – but by heavily integrating itself with the main series and understanding the humor that makes it shine, Film: Red ranks at the top of One Piece’s features.\"\nIf you want to stream this movie online rather than purchase a physical version, there are currently two main places you can watch it online with a subscription. The first ison Netflix, which has pretty much all of One Piece available to stream. The second option is a Premium Crunchyroll subscription, which does offer a free trial for new subscribers."

Over the years, the Apple-owned platform has grown into a powerhouse of original TV shows, likeTed LassoandSeverance, as well as movies likeKillers of the Flower Moon. While it may not release new content at the same pace as something like Netflix, Apple TV+ is only a fraction of the price and comes bundled with just about every new Apple device purchase, making it easier than ever to check out its growing library. Below, we'll break down what Apple TV+ is as a service, how much it costs, and how to sign up for a free trial.\n\nApple TV+ offers a 7-day free trial for all new subscribers. Simply head over to theApple TV+ homepageor app and you'll be greeted with a button that says \"Accept Free Trial.\" NewiPhones,iPads, Apple TVs, and Mac computers also come bundled with a 3-month Apple TV+ trial, which requires manual activation through the Apple TV app on the device. In both cases, once your trial ends, your subscription will automatically renew at the standard monthly rate of $9.99/month.\nApple TV+ is an award-winning streaming service featuring Apple Originals — exclusive series, movies, documentaries, and more, with new content added every month. While it was a bit barebones when it launched in 2019, Apple TV+ has grown its library to over 180 series, with breakout hits like Ted Lasso, Severance, and Silo, as well as over 80 original films, including Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. Apple TV+ was also thefirst streaming service to receive an Academy Award for its original film CODA, which released in 2022.\nWhile Apple TV+ may not boast a massive library like Netflix, it's long maintained a \"quality over quantity\" approach when it comes to its original programming with something that will surely appeal to just about anyone, regardless of age.\nApple TV+ is one of the least-expensive streaming services at $9.99/month.Since there's no ads by default, there's no ad-supported or limited tiers to worry about.\nAside from standalone subscriptions, Apple TV+ is included in a bundled service calledApple One. The lowest-tier Apple One plan gives you access to four subscriptions: Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and a 50GB iCloud+ plan, all for $19.95/month.

    "full_text": "Amazon sales are some of the best ways to get cheap 4K TVs, butSpring Deal Dayshas kicked it up a notch for£200 off this 48\" OLED LG evo C3, making it only £599.\n\nAmong the various brands offering OLED TVs these days, LG's have usually been ranked among the very best. When you take a look at some of its features, it's not too hard to understand why.\nPresented in an ultra-slim design that's great for minimalist spaces, the evo C3 brings LG's array of impressive OLED TV technologies to your entertainment and gaming. For instance, the Gen6 a9 AI processor makes this unit an absolute powerhouse for 4K displays and crystal-clear immersive sound.\nThis isn't just great for the latest TV shows & movies like Severance and Mickey 17, but gaming too. The OLED LG evo 3's 0.1ms response time and added AMD features mean you'll be able to play games likeAssassin's Creed ShadowsandFortnite, both beautifully and with minimal input lag.

Still, if all that really matters to you is just having a decent 4K TV in general without extra bells and whistles— with a nice soundbar to back it up— the Hisense bundle will offer you a lot more for your money at a smaller price tag."

    "full_text": "Sony is working on a new Starship Troopers movie reboot, according to various Hollywood sources.\n\nThe Hollywood Reportersaid District 9, Elysium, and Chappie director Neill Blomkamp has signed on to write and direct a new adaptation of Starship Troopers, the 1959 military sci-fi novel by Robert A. Heinlein.DeadlineandVarietybacked up the report.\nThis new Starship Troopers movie is not a continuation of or related to Paul Verhoeven’s cult classic 1997 sci-fi satireStarship Troopers. Rather it is a new adaptation of Heinlein’s novel, and comes from Sony’s Columbia Pictures.\nNews of Blomkamp’s involvement with this new Starship Troopers movie feels puzzling givenSony itself recently announced a live-action movie of blockbuster PlayStation Studios shooter Helldivers. Arrowhead's Helldivers is heavily inspired by Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers, and sees cannon fodder soldiers tasked with defending a satirized fascist Super Earth regime from alien bugs, among other enemy factions, while preaching Liberty and Managed Democracy to the masses.\nSony now faces the prospect of having new Starship Troopers and Helldivers movies going up against each other, although The Hollywood Reporter said Blomkamp’s take is not a remake of the Verhoeven movie, rather a return to the source material. Heinlein’s book that Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers is based on differs strongly in tone from the film, with many believing it promotes the ideals the film satirizes.\nNeither this new Starship Troopers nor the Helldivers movie has a release window, so it may be some time before we see or hear from either project. Blomkamp’s last film was Sony’s own Gran Turismo, an adaptation of the long-running PlayStation-exclusive driving simulation series.\nPhoto by TriStar Pictures/Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alto-knights-review-robert-de-niro",
    "full_text": "If you were to stitch all of the greatest hits of the gangster genre into a single movie, you could do a whole lot worse than Barry Levinson’s The Alto Knights. Written by Nicholas Pileggi (who adapted his own nonfiction books intoGoodfellasandCasino) Levinson’s, the latest movie from the director ofBugsydepends entirely on its central gimmick: screen mobster extraordinaire Robert De Niro in the dual role of warring crime bosses. It tends to talk in circles, doesn’t offer much to get emotionally invested in, and rides an awkward line between caricature and traditional drama, but it has just enough visual energy to remain interesting.\n\nThe Alto Knights stars De Niro as Frank Costello, a respected mafioso on the edges of legitimacy. It also stars De Niro as Costello’s lifelong friend Vito Genovese, a much seedier gangster who returns to New York after years away and tries to reclaim his throne. Following a failed attempt on his life – a hit he quickly figures out was ordered by Genovese – Costello opts not for the traditional, muscular mob response, but instead takes it as a sign to leave his life of crime. But as we know from decades of movies and TV, you don’t leave the mob until the mob leaves you.\nAn older Costello narrates most of the onscreen action, which makes for both a minor strength and a major crutch. The wistfulness and air of mischief with which he looks back on the grimy glory days makes Levinson’s story feel alive, but The Alto Knights also heavily depends on exposition to fill in some major gaps. It’s a film that’s largely told, with little by way of actually showing. That is, until it’s time to show how often its characters speak in dull repetition. That’s all in spite of abundant photo-and-film-reel montages that are meant to explain Costello and Genovese’s shared history in Manhattan’s Little Italy, but reveal little more than the time they spent together at the infamous mob hangout The Alto Knights Social Club. Little about their dynamic is ever illuminated, no matter where and when we meet them.\nThis lack of specificity goes hand in hand with The Alto Knights’ inability to determine whether it’s a straightforward biopic or a self-aware commentary on gangster movies as a whole. Levinson splits the difference: On one hand, De Niro delivers a mostly naturalistic performance as Costello, which matches the registers of co-stars like Debra Messing, Kathrine Narducci, and Robert Uricola. On the other hand, De Niro gets bigger and broader with Genovese, hunching over and pitching up his voice. It’s hard not to see the performance as an impression of (or a tribute to) De Niro’sRaging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino, andThe Irishmanco-star Joe Pesci. Costello, meanwhile, is colored in shades from the mobsters in De Niro’s past, be they the fictitious Vito Corleone inThe Godfather Part IIor the very real Al Capone inThe Untouchables. It’s why you go with De Niro for a role like this: As far back asAnalyze This, he’s been molding new characters around archetypes he himself helped build.\nThis more cartoonish approach ultimately bleeds into the looks of the characters, and their behavior, too. For all its stabs at realism in dialogue and performances, The Alto Knights bears a visual resemblance to Warren Beatty’s live-action-comic-strip version ofDick Tracy. The prosthetic nose De Niro wears as Costello protrudes like that of a Halloween-costume witch; playing Genovese, he’s given a jaw so square, it almost makes his head seem too big for his body. (From some angles, he looks like a Funko Pop.) Cosmo Jarvis, who plays the would-be assassin Vincent Gigante, hobbles around with an enlarged barrel chest and a triple (sometimes quadruple) chin.\nThis all works best when Costello and Genovese share the screen; unfortunately, they don’t have many scenes together. In the rare De Niro-versus-De Niro moments, the actor fires on all cylinders. He creates glances of thought, doubt, and desire out of practically nothing, and turns tedious conversations into riveting negotiations. The most exciting sequence is one where Genovese and Costello share an emotional connection despite being separated by several states: The former watches (and responds out loud to) a televised congressional hearing at which the latter speaks.\nThis is the one time The Alto Knights approaches real depth and tension. Granted, this scene is just as dialogue-heavy as the rest of the film, but its words disguise and reveal self-doubt in equal measure, rather than simply stating the character’s thoughts and feelings out loud. The colorful ensemble does its best to breathe life into the movie, but ultimately, it struggles to entice and endear, listing through endless scenes with no direction. With De Niro at the helm of Levinson’s mob-movie curiosities, you’re at least guaranteed a seasoned hand and a novel combination of desires and impulses courtesy of one of Hollywood’s greatest talents. That’s worth something, even if The Alto Knights as a whole fails to do anything new with the familiar trappings of gangsters, molls, betrayals, and assassinations.\nBarry Levinson’s mob movie The Alto Knights falls somewhere between caricature and straightforward drama. It can’t decide whether it wants to tell the real-life story of respected mob boss Frank Costello and his comrade-turned-scheming-enemy Vito Genovese, or if it wants to skewer the entire genre of films they helped inspire. However, with Robert De Niro in both leading roles, there’s always something interesting to watch, even if it’s buried by mountains of repetitive dialogue."

The TeeTurtle brand is one of the most common brands offering reviersible plushies, which is found above from Avatar: The Last Airbender, TMNT, and the Axolotl stuffed animals.\nA personal favorite of mine is theInside Out 2 Embarrassed Character plush. I love the Inside Out movies and characters, and I appreciate the fact the plush is weighted for extra comfort and anxiety relief. Plus, it's only $14.40.

Last year, LEGO released a huge set of the Sauron’s iconic Dark Tower, akaBarad-dûr. And now, finally available for anyone to buy (exclusively at theLEGO Store), is a lovely, peaceful set based on The Shire – specifically, the hillside residence of Bilbo and Frodo in Bag-End.\n\nThe Shire is a bucolic build based on a peaceful, down-to-earth setting. In fact, the house depicted in the set is carved right into the earth of a hillside. It’s comprised of three rooms that are filled with all sorts of details and Easter eggs from the stories. It also comes with Gandalf’s cart, the tent that gets blasted into the air by a dragon firework (also included), as well as the stage on which Bilbo disappears during his eleventy-first birthday celebration.\nThe set comes with nine minifigures:\nThe main complaint I’ve seen about this set is the price – and it’s a fair complaint, to be sure. This set costs 34% more than it “should” based on the traditional math of LEGO sets costing roughly 10 cents per brick. Surely there’s an IP tax for the Lord of the Rings branding, but even still it’s a lot. If it’s out of your range, that’s fair enough. It will likely be discounted at some point down the line, probably after it loses its LEGO Store exclusivity and comes to other retailers like Amazon or Target.\nHowever, it’s still a very coolLEGO set for adultsthat would be a great addition for any fans of the Lord of the Rings books, movies, or any other medium they’ve landed in over the years.\nBe sure to check out ourWe Build LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Shirefeature for full details on what it’s like to build the set.

    "full_text": "If you’re a Minecraft die-hard, you might have seen one particularly sneaky Easter egg in the new film adaptationA Minecraft Movie— but all is not what it seems. According to Mojang Studios Senior Creative Director of Entertainment and producer on A Minecraft Movie, Torfi Frans Olafsson, that moment that seemed to be alluding to the 2010 Creepypasta storyHerobrineisn't an Easter egg, but a mistake the visual effects team ran out of time to fix.\n\nWarning!Spoilers for A Minecraft Movie follow:\nFor context, A Minecraft Movie has a scene that takes place at the Woodland Mansion where Henry (Sebastian Hansen) meets an Enderman who puts him in a state where he’s able to see a vision of Steve (Jack Black), except the character is verbally berating him as his eyes go white. Because Herobrine is characterized as Steve with white eyes, fans were convinced that the moment signified that there was a future for the Creepypasta story within the MCU (Minecraft Cinematic Universe, duh).\nHowever, Olafsson has cast doubt on this assumption. \"It’s super strange that all of their eyes were supposed to be purple but when it was rendered one of the characters eyes kept coming out white in the final rendered frames so we wound up keeping it like that, because the VFX studio ran out of time,\" he revealed onX / Twitter.\nIn the early Minecraft days, an anonymous poster on 4chan claimed they saw an in-game version of Steve with white eyes and weird powers showing up around the game. Following the post,a Creepypasta storysurfaced, which “revealed” that the character anomaly was actually the spirit of a dead player.\nOlafsson's comment is being taken by many fans as a knowing wink to this being a genuine Herobrine Easter egg in A Minecraft Movie. After all, the joke is that it's an unfixable error, that Herobrine appears and can't be removed.\nWe’ve got plenty more on A Minecraft Movie, includinghow rowdy fans are creating wild scenes in the cinema, causing some to say it’s ruining their experience.\nIGN’sA Minecraft Movie reviewreturned a 6/10.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/christopher-nolan-the-odyssey-movie-perfect-guy",
    "full_text": "That Christopher Nolan! What an unpredictable guy he is, with his “movies told out of order” games, “is it a dream or reality” stories, “what timeframe are we witnessing things happen in” trickery, and his “screw it, let’s just run time backwards” hijinks.\n\nAll of which is to say, for someone with such a notably wacky outside-the-box storytelling track record, it’s a bit surprising that Nolan’s next movie is seemingly a straight-up adaptation of Homer’s epic poemThe Odyssey.\nSure, we don’t really know all that much about the film yet.Matt Damon is playing Odysseus, who is of course the main character of Homer’s story, and an extensive group of noteworthy actors have been cast in as-yet unannounced roles in the film, including Tom Holland, Zendaya, Jon Bernthal, Lupita Nyong'o, Anne Hathaway, Robert Pattinson, and Charlize Theron, among others. The Odyssey is shooting now and has a release date of July 17, 2026, with Universal Pictures calling the film “a mythic action epic shot across the world using brand new IMAX film technology.”\nMatt Damon is Odysseus. A film by Christopher Nolan,#TheOdysseyMovieis in theaters July 17, 2026.pic.twitter.com/7a5YbfqVfG\nReal quick for those who skipped it in high school, The Odyssey tells the 10-year story of Odysseus’ attempt to get home to the Greek island of Ithaca after the events of the Trojan War, an effort that is made all the more difficult when he angers the god of the sea, Poseidon. And this after already being stuck at Troy for 10 years! Waiting for him at home are his now adult son Telemachus and his ever-faithful wife Penelope, although things have grown increasingly dicey for both of them as a group of “suitors” vie for Penelope’s hand in marriage. As he fights to get home, Odysseus encounters all manner of mythological creatures and challenges.\nIt’s freaking great, and one of my favorite books. But it’s also proven challenging to properly adapt to the screen. There have been a bunch of attempts over the years, dating back at least as far as the 1911 Italian silent film L'Odissea, but often the scope of Odysseus’ story has been truncated or mismanaged in translation to movie or TV form. However, Nolan, fresh off the financial and critical success of the Oscar-winning Oppenheimer, is perfectly placed to finally get Homer’s story right on the big screen.\nBut again, what exactly is the director drawn to in this story? He’s often got sci-fi or sci-fi adjacent concepts in his films, and while Odysseus certainly exists in the realm of the fantastical, that’s not quite the same vibe. (A cyclops is not sci-fi, sorry!) Still, I think there’s a good chance that Nolan’s real obsession… no, not dead wives, hisotherobsession… could be why he’s making this movie, and also why he’sperfectfor this movie: It’s his interest in playing with time, or how the viewer perceives time in relation to the story being told, that is perhaps the key to nailing The Odyssey.\nOne of the reasons why The Odyssey has always been a challenge to properly adapt to movies and TV (aside from the obstacle of convincing visual effects until relatively recently) is the nature of the main character’s story. While his time away in the Trojan War isn’t technically part of The Odyssey (that’s The Iliad, for those who also skippedthatclass), those first 10 years away from his family are a necessary bit of backstory that infuses The Odyssey with a lot of its emotion. Add to that the 10 years that it takes Odysseus to finally get back home andthenthe actual re-taking of that home when he battles the suitors (this last part was its own movie alone just last year –The Returnstarring Ralph Fiennes), and you’ve got a lot of story taking place over a very long period of time.\nI’ve always thought that biopics always run the danger of being the CliffsNotes version of a person’s life, which is why when a movie like James Mangold’s A Complete Unknown focuses in on just a few years of a historical figure like Bob Dylan’s life, it can be a much more effective way of telling a story. Equally, trying to do The Odyssey in, what, three hours? It’s a tall, tall order.\nBut here comes old Chris Nolan withhis timey-wimeyand, let’s be fair, highly creative ways of dipping in and out of a story, using the very nature of time as a tool rather than an obstacle. Look at Interstellar, where Matthew McConaughey’s Cooper takes off into outer space for what is basically a one-way mission where time gets all kinds of weird for him and his crewmates, even while his children grow to adulthood back on Earth and, eventually, mourn their apparently lost father. There are certainly Odyssey parallels right there in terms of the missing father on a lost voyage, whose family faces disaster back home, but it’s the way that Nolan tells the story, despite the challenges of, well, time, that is so affecting. He’s not deterred by the vast gulf between the father and his children, but instead uses it to his advantage.\nOdyseuss fights a giant Cyclops, sees a bunch of his men turned into pigs, and confronts a bunch of other crazy shit in his story, but he also faces time as an enemy, and in a variety of ways. Not only is he literally 20 years away from his family by the end of his journey, but seven of those years see him trapped on the island of the nymph Calypso, who loves him and offers him immortality (another aspect of time or the perception of it) if he’ll stay with her. He and his crew's visit to the realm of the Lotus-Eaters plays with time in a different way, in that those who eat the fruit of the land lose any interest in returning home, content to stay and eat the fruit forever. And then there’s our hero’s trip to the Underworld, where he finds lost friends and family, including his mother and his comrade Achilles, who are doomed to exist, if not quite live, for eternity as mere shades of their former selves.\nThen there’s the situation back home, as Telemachus was just a baby when his father left and is now a young man. Odysseus’ father Laertes is a sad shell of his former self, having lost his wife to grief over the past 20 years, while assuming his son is gone forever too. And in one of the most effective passages in Homer’s poem, even Odyseuss’ dog Argos has been waiting for him all this time!\nWill Nolan be able to tell Odyseuss’ full story effectively by utilizing his particular brand of stylized filmmaking? The guy is fixated on time, and by extension memory, and that certainly seems to be a quality he shares with the hero of The Odyssey as well, a man who eventually has nothingbutmemories – of his family and the life he once lived – to rely on as he fights the great gulf of time to get home."

    "full_text": "The Legend of Zelda live-action movieis in active development at Nintendo and Sony Pictures fora March 2027 release. It’s early days yet for the hotly anticipated feature film adaptation of the blockbuster video game franchise – which, after years of rumors, wasofficially announced in November 2023– so here’s what we know for sure about the movie so far.\n\nThe film is being produced by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Avi Arad, chairman of Arad Productions and former founder and CEO of Marvel Studios. Sony Pictures Entertainment will handle theatrical distribution in addition to co-financing the movie with Nintendo. Jurassic World’s Derek Connolly is writing the screenplay.\nWes Ball, who made the Maze Runner movies and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, is directing Zelda. As if he was fated to land the job,Ball actually tweeted about wanting to make a Zelda movie way back in 2010.\nAt that time, Ball said he envisioned his Zelda as being another mo-cap endeavor like James Cameron’s Avatar. More recently, the filmmaker said he wants his Legend of Zelda to be “this awesome fantasy-adventure movie that isn’t like Lord of the Rings, it’s its own thing. I've always said, I would love to see a live-action Miyazaki. That wonder and whimsy that he brings to things, I would love to see something like that.\"\nIn a later interview, Ball backed off of his 2010 notion of making it a mo-cap movie. In May 2024, Ball said makingan all mo-cap Zelda movie “probably isn't his choice”since he was just coming off of the CG-heavy KIngdom of the Planet of the Apes. Ball’s aim is to make Legend of Zelda feel \"grounded\" and \"real.\" He added, “We're working hard, and we're gonna make something great.\"\nBall has also said: \"I want to fulfil people's greatest desires. I know it's important, this [Zelda] franchise, to people, and I want it to be a serious movie. A real movie that can give people an escape. … [The film has] \"to feel like something real. Something serious and cool but fun and whimsical.\"\nA die hard Zelda fan who said he grew up on the franchise, Ball unintentionally stirred up other fans whenhe refused to tell IGN last year what his favorite Zelda game was.\nNo one has been cast yet but The Sixth Sense’sHaley Joel Osment expressed his desire to land a role in the Zelda moviewhen he appeared onIGN Arcade. Euphoria’sHunter Schafer has expressed interest in playing Princess Zelda.\nEuphoria star Hunter Schafer is a fan of the Nintendo series, saying, “I love the game, personally. I played it as a kid and I still play it now. Who knows! That would be pretty cool.”pic.twitter.com/lDNB1BkEqJ\nFan reaction when the movie was officially announcedback in November 2023 was swift and opinionated. Some took umbrage at Avi Arad – the former boss of Marvel Studios who also produced Ghost in the Shell and the early Spider-Man movies – being involved (“Can't believe they were able to get the producer of the hit film Morbius!!”). Others weren’t thrilled by the selection of Wes Ball to direct.\nThe decision to make the Legend of Zelda a live-action movie was met with trepidation: “People can say Zelda plot doesn't work in live action but action films have hardly ever relied on deep, complex plots to engage people.” “Animated would have been the way to go if you ask me.”\nIGN editors also expressed their thoughts aboutwhy Zelda should be an animated movie instead of live-action. “And while hand-drawn art may be the best fit for a Zelda movie in my opinion, there are plenty of animation styles that would serve as a better vehicle for Zelda than live-action,” IGN’s Logan Plant wrote at the time the movie was announced.\n“Think about all the gorgeous animated projects we’ve seen in the last several years: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Dragon Quest: Your Story, the Castlevania anime, or even a claymation look come to mind as visual styles that would perfectly suit the wonderful world of Hyrule. I can visualize what all these versions of Hyrule would look like, but I can’t say the same thing about live-action.”\n“There are so many oddities in Zelda that come across as charming when animated, but could easily be seen as off-putting when done in live-action. This is a franchise where a literal enormous pig is the main villain, after all. But Zelda is also full of surprising horrors, from zombies that wrap their entire bodies around Link to try and kill him, to disembodied giant hands that swoop down from the ceiling. I have a hard time seeing a lot of Zelda enemies make it into a live-action movie without seriously frightening the little ones.”\nIGN’s Matt Kim also opined at the time thatit would be “a trap” if Nintendo and Ball tried to adapt Breath of the Wildfor the silver screen: “If you’re going to make a Zelda movie, I’d adapt one of the games where the story is a bit more center-stage, whether it’s the pirate adventures of Wind Waker, the classic sword and sorcery of A Link to the Past, or arguably the most cinematic Zelda game of all-time, Twilight Princess.”\n“Game devs have marveled at the power of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom’s engineering, calling the way its systems interact with each other near-magic. It’s not just showing audiences Link’s cool abilities but playing within an entire world, with its own laws of nature that just simply cannot be conveyed by looking at a screen alone. While there are plenty of fun moments a Breath of the Wild movie could include as fun easter eggs — like Link discovering he gets a stat bonus when he cooks during the blood moon for example — the game’s sense of discovery can never truly be captured on camera. … Breath of the Wild turns players into theoretical physicists, experimenting with how the interlocking rules of the game play off one another – which, unless the director plans on making a movie similar to Oppenheimer, would make for not a lousy Zelda movie.”\nFor their part, the filmmakers acknowledge the risk inherent in making a live-action Zelda movie. \"Regarding the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda,I know we face an extremely high hurdlein producing a film that will not disappoint the global fan base,\" Shigeru Miyamoto told Nintendo investors during a Q&A in November 2023. Miyamoto added that he had been developing the Zelda movie with Arad for ten years prior to the official announcement.\nSony Pictures will release The Legend of Zelda in theaters on March 26, 2027. In order to make that date, fans should expect filming to commence in 2026 or maybe even late this year to allow for enough post-production time to pull of the film’s visual effects.\nThere isn’t one as nothing has been filmed yet. However, IGN pranked the Internet on April Fool’s Day 2008 when we releaseda faux live-action Zelda movie trailer(which can be viewed below). Until there’s a real movie trailer to watch, ours will have to do:\nWho do you think should play Link, Zelda and other key characters in the upcoming movie? Let us know in the comments."

This review is based on a screening at the 2025 SXSW Film and TV Festival.\n\nUsually, the most harrowing thing that might happen if you fail to modify your AirDrop settings is a bunch of teenagers sending you random dick pics – a scenario that’s tweaked in the new Christopher Landon-directed techno-thriller Drop. Landon, who also madeHappy Death DayandFreaky, loves a gimmick. And “What if phone, but scary?” sure seems like one. Fortunately, Drop is more interested in thrilling the audience than winking at us, and is a more entertaining film as a result.\nDrop makes harassment-by-Bluetooth scary by pivoting away from the prankster angle early on. At first, Violet (Meghann Fahy) is annoyed when someone starts sending her random memes as she waits for her date to arrive at a swanky restaurant on the 38th floor of a Chicago skyscraper. Then the messages start getting more personalized, and Violet realizes that whoever is targeting her – she’s not sure who, but it has to be someone within 50 feet, given their weapon of choice – is watching her, setting a locked-room mystery plot into motion.\nThe obvious question here is, “Why doesn't she just switch off her phone and leave?” And that’s where the kid in peril comes in. Violet is a single mother, widowed in an incident that’s teased in the movie’s cold open but whose traumatizing details aren’t revealed until the very end. Violet has spent most of the five years since holed up at home with her son, Toby (Jacob Robinson), who was a baby when his dad died and is now a precocious kid with glasses and intense separation anxiety. When she pushes back, Violet’s mystery contact starts threatening Toby, and Drop isjustmean enough that we can’t be certain that the little guy will make it out of this alive.\nViolet isn’t handling her first time away from Toby since his infancy very well either, compounding her jitters about meeting Henry (Brandon Sklenar), the handsome photographer she’s been messaging on a dating app for the past three months. Henry is patient and understanding, and genuinely interested in building a relationship; without revealing too much, it’s very unlikely that he’s the one provoking Violet. And in a movie landscape choked with well-meaning but hacky takedowns of monstrous men hiding behind friendly façades, it’s kind of refreshing to have a movie where the nice guy is actually, well, nice.\nDrop’s tight structure and compounding twists are reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan, with the major difference being that Shyamalan would never get as snarky as Landon does in the first act. Search Party’s Jeffery Self carries much of the comedic burden as an oversharing, eager-to-please waiter, who loses patience with Violet’s increasingly bizarre requests but has to keep smiling and accommodating her. (This is a very expensive restaurant.) There are some sick giggles to be had later on, one of them an R-rated Spielberg bit involving Toby, a loaded handgun, and a remote controlled car. But for the most part, Drop abandons the wisecracks once the stakes reach life-or-death heights.\nNot every part of this more earnest approach works: Even when it’s not a-joke-a-minute, a Christopher Landon movie is probably not the place to be exploring themes of domestic abuse. But the fundamentals of action, tension, and escalating suspense are strong, and Landon makes great use of the claustrophobic central location and its vertigo-inducing heights. This unpretentious thrill ride is a fun diversion, and a surprisingly good date movie – providing your date isn’t too triggered by a lounge-piano rendition of “Baby Shark.” Parenthood is difficult, y’all.\nDrop is a tightly plotted and unpretentious thrill ride. By concentrating on suspense (with only a light sprinkling of snark), Happy Death Day and Freaky director Christopher Landon successfully pulls off the techno-paranoiac premise of a night on the town disrupted by a series of escalating, Bluetooth-enabled threats. The result is a locked-room mystery that’s also a surprisingly good date movie."

    "full_text": "The Boysstar Jack Quaid has said he’d love to appear in a BioShock movie, saying the much-loved first-person shooter is one of his favorite games of all time.\n\nSpeaking in aReddit AMAtimed to coincide with the launch of his new movie, Novocaine, QuaidsaidBioShock has “such a rich lore” that could be explored in a TV or movie adaptation.\n\"I would actually love to be in a live action adaptation of Bioshock - one of my favorite games of all time,\" he said. \"I think there's such a rich lore to that game that could be explored in a TV or movie adaptation.\"\nBut what are the chances the Bioshock movie actually gets made? In July last year, producer Roy Lee said that, following leadership changes,the video-game-to-movie BioShock adaptation had been “reconfigured,” resulting in a “more personal” film.\nLee said some of the changes came from lower budgets from Netflix. Details about the BioShock movie’s plot have not been revealed, so it’s unclear what it would have looked like before the shift. Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence is stillattached to direct.\n“The new regime has lowered the budgets,” Lee said at the time. “So we’re doing a much smaller version. It’s going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”\nQuaid’s comments on BioShock come alongside an admission that he looks a lot like video game action star Max Payne, whose likeness is based on Remedy writer Sam Lake. Indeed, there are shots from Quaid’s new action movieNovocainethat have caused fans to wonder if it’s a Max Payne movie in disguise.\nLive action Max Payne. Seems so real so worth it. This is Max Payne. You got me watching this now. Even the woman looks like the woman from Max Payne 2 lol. The resemblance is almost as if NovoCaine characters (basically is) by the same actor (Jack Quad looking like Sam Lake)pic.twitter.com/kawh2C1B2n\nAlas, it seems Quaid is less familiar with Max Payne, which is currently getting the remake treatment from Remedy in a deal with original publisher and rights holder Rockstar.\n“I've seen people say that I look like Max Payne, and when I've looked at the box art, even I did a double-take,\" Quaid continued. \"I love Rockstar's games, but unfortunately I've never played that one - it's next on the list, for sure.”\nApart from Bioshock, Quaid loves FromSoftware games. In the same Reddit AMA, Quaid said he loved the challenge presented by the likes of Bloodborne and Elden Ring.\n“I'm a huge video game nerd,”he said. “And lately I've been diving headfirst into the FromSoftware library. I beat Bloodborne, then I beat Sekiro, and now I'm going full boar into Elden Ring. Actually, the thing I use Reddit the most for is tips and tricks on beating Fromsoft's bosses. I love how challenging the games are - it took me a while to get into them, but now I'm obsessed.”\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

The OLED panel benefits from a near instantaneous response time (sub 0,.03ms) and supports features like variable refresh rate (VRR) including G-SYNC and auto low latency mode (ALLM). Note that despite this being a Sony TV, it pairs equally well with an Xbox console.\nSony OLED TVs use Google TV as its smart interface. Google TV is intuitive to use and supports voice commands through Google Assistant. You can also pair it with an Android phone to use as a remote.\nYou don't have to wait for the new 2025 LG TVs to drop to score a great deal on an older generation model.

    "publishedAt": "2025-03-21T15:45:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-march-21-2025",
    "full_text": "I didn’t think we’d see a proper Pokémon TCG restock this early in 2025. Honestly, I was betting on summer at best, but here we are with actual product showing up on Amazon and not behind some sketchy paywalled Discord server. While the internet’s currently losing its mind over Prismatic Evolutions and burning money chasing stock alerts for Rival Destinies, the smart play is scooping up the older sets that just hit Amazon Global. We’re talking Scarlet and Violet era stuff, Sword and Shield throwbacks, and boxes that were basically extinct six months ago.\n\nThis is the kind of flood the TCG community needed. Not just for collectors trying to complete sets, but for anyone who’s tired of battling bots for ETBs like it’s the Hunger Games. There’s a real mix available right now: Booster Bundles, Premium Collections, tins with actual storage value. And yes, even a few deals that make it feel like Amazon’s trying to keep the vibe positive. If you’re chasing big pulls like Greninja SIR or Pikachu ex SIR, or just need to stock up on sleeves and dice, this is the best stock refreshes we’ve seen in a while.\nAliExpress is currently offering theSony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphonesfor only $225.18 after coupon code:IFP7FJZis applied during checkout. This product is stocked in a US warehouse, so it ships free and arrives within about a week. This is an import model with a warranty that won't be honored in the United States. AliExpress makes up for it with a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days.\nIn our glowingSony WH1000XM5 review, Kevin Lee wrote that \"The Sony WH-1000XM5 is hands down the best sounding and most impressive noise-canceling headphones around. They demand a high premium but the cost of audio excellence is well worth it with this pair of headphones.\"\nThe real deal here is the fact that theTwilight MasqueradeElite Trainer Box is actually in stock. Seeing it available without a 200% markup or sketchy third-party seller feels borderline miraculous. You’re getting nine booster packs, a full-art Teal Mask Ogerpon promo, and all the usual ETB goodies like energy cards, condition markers, and themed sleeves.\nIt’s not every day you seeBrilliant StarsBuild and Battle Boxes in stock, let alone without having to navigate the wild west of resale sites. At $63.34, this one comes with four booster packs and a pre-release promo card, which makes it a solid pickup for collectors looking to flesh out their Sword and Shield era sets. Arceus VSTAR headlines the expansion, and the pull potential here still holds up.\nAmong Us 4-Pack on Steam is a sneaky little deal that gives you four copies of the game for the price of one, making it dangerously easy to rope your friends into a night of trust issues and vent-related betrayal. It supports cross-platform play, customizable settings, and chaotic emergency meetings that usually end with the wrong person getting ejected. If you’ve somehow missed the social deduction chaos, now’s the perfect time to catch up and take three crewmates down with you.\nTheHisuian Electrode V Boxis back in stock at Amazon for $42.45, which is a win considering how sporadically these pop up. It's one of those V boxes that slipped under the radar when it first launched, but now that Sword and Shield-era product is drying up it’s worth grabbing. You get a foil Hisuian Electrode V promo, a regular Electrode foil, an oversized version (because why not), and four booster packs to rip through.\nThis limited-edition snack box is a flavor-packed tribute toAssassin’s Creed Shadows, blending premium Japanese treats with collectible game merch in a way that feels like an edible side quest. You get 15 unique snacks, a full bag of exclusive Kit Kats, a custom Tenugui towel, and even an in-game item called The Hourglass that’s only available through this box. With artwork prints, a detailed snack guide, and a box sleeve that transforms into a display-worthy poster, it’s more than just snacks.\nSeeing theShining FatesPikachu V Box on Amazon again feels like spotting a shiny in the wild. At $49.96 it’s not exactly a steal, but having it in stock is the real value. This box comes with a foil Pikachu V promo, an oversized version for flair, and four Shining Fates booster packs. That means a legit shot at pulls from one of the most hype-filled sets of the Sword and Shield era.\nTheSurging SparksBooster Bundle is actually in stock at Amazon for $47.95, which is kind of a miracle considering how fast this set’s been disappearing. You get six booster packs from the newest Scarlet and Violet expansion, which includes some major chase cards like Pikachu ex SIR and Latias ex. If you missed the chaos of launch day or couldn’t snag a bundle without battling bots, this is your chance to catch up.\nI want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.\nThis phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.\nI can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.\nRimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.\nThis SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.\nI never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.\nI think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.\nApple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.\nBeats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art. The remastered soundtracks, modernized UI, and quality-of-life improvements bring these classics into the modern age while keeping their original charm intact. Each game features iconic character designs by Kazuko Shibuya and a faithful soundtrack rearranged by Nobuo Uematsu. Whether you’re reliving the golden age of RPGs or playing them for the first time, this bundle is the ultimate way to experience Final Fantasy’s roots. The limited-time sale price of $52.49, down from $74.99, makes this an easy win for any RPG fan.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experience Final Fantasy I through VI in glorious HD pixel art.

Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.\nIf you’re tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.\nWhy buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.\nIf you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.\nStill using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.\nThese aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.\nThese Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.\nLuxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.\nThis isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.\nFor those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says \"powerful Pokémon\" like an angry robot penguin).\nI'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.\nIf somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.\nYour PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).\nIf you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, \"I really need to delete some games,\" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.\nLogitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.\nSamsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room.

The LG Evo C-series of TVs have consistently been ourfavorite high-end 4K TVs, especially for 4K HDR movies and gaming.\n\nThe LG Evo C3 is a 2023 model, just one year behind the 2024 LG Evo C4. So what are the differences? Aside from the $650 price difference, not much. The most important trait -- picture quality -- is more or less identical. Where the C4 improves on the C3 are an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate.\nOLED TVs are considered the best TVs you can buy right now. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, they offer better image quality, deeper blacks, better contrast ratio, wider color gamut, and super fast response times. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV are easily the best type of TV for viewing 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations.\nThe LG C3 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel and all four HDMI 2.1 ports for running 4K at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. It also supports variable refresh rate (VRR), auto low latency mode (ALLM), and DTS audio, which is good for people who still watch Blu-ray discs. The C3 is also much easier to set up than its predecessors; the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that drops the weight to a mere 36 pounds.\nThe LG Evo C-series TV is ourfavorite high-end 4K TV of 2025because of the brilliance of its OLED display along with a host of quality features that don't quite push it to the point of an excessively high price. This model brings better contrast and clarity than the previous year's already luminous LG C2. It’s a sight to behold, especially when you add in the deep blacks and well-balanced colors on the crisp 4K screen. Once you choose OLED, it's hard to go back to anything else.\nThe LG Evo C5 hasn't yet been released, butit was showcased during CES 2025. At least on paper, the improvements of the C5 seem to be incremental, with no major ground breaking updates that would make you want to hold off until its launch. More importantly, the C5 will probably release at a very high retail price which will take months to get down to a level that's competitive with other TV deals.\nLooking for more options?

    "full_text": "Snow White was Disney’s miracle. The 1937 adaptation of the 19th-century Grimm fairy tale became the first animated feature film in America and reigned as thehighest-grossing animated filmfor the next 55 years. Much of the Disney we know and grew up with started with Snow White and the Evil Queen, so it's unsurprising that's where Disney looked for its next live-action remake.\n\nBringing the fairy tale to life is Rachel Zegler, a musical veteran and star ofSteven Spielberg's West Side Story remake, while Wonder Woman herself, Gal Gadot, takes the role of Evil Queen. IGN'sSnow White reviewdescribes the movie as \"the best Disney live-action remake in a decade (not that that’s a particularly high bar to clear),\" that adapts the \"broad strokes of the 1937 original, while fleshing out its themes of kindness.\"\nWhether you're a diehard Disney fan, looking for a movie to take the family to, or are just curious aboutall the controversies, here’s everything you need to know to watch Snow White.\nSnow White just released in theaters. You can check for showtimes near you at the main theater links below:\nIt should come as no surprise that Disney’s Snow White will eventually stream on Disney+ instead of Netflix.Disney+ subscriptionsstart at $9.99, though one of thebest streaming dealsright now includesfour months of Disney+ and Hulufor $2.99/month.\nIn terms of a potential release date,Mufasacomes to Disney+ on March 26, just under three months after it released in theaters, whileMoana 2arrived on the streaming service in just over three months. Assuming the new live action Disney movie follows a similar release schedule,Snow White should be streaming on Disney+ by the end of June.\nThe original Snow White movie was inspired by the 1812 Brothers’ Grimm story of the same name, which you can read onlinehere. The new live-action Snow White adapts the animated movie, though with some elements “reimagined” for modern audiences. Here’s the new movie’s synopsis:\nA princess joins forces with seven dwarfs to liberate her kingdom from her cruel stepmother the Evil Queen.\nTheoriginal Snow White and the Seven Dwarfsis streaming on Disney+. It’s also available to rent or buy from most digital platforms, and has received several physical releases over the years.\nThe Snow White remake is directed byMarc Webb(The Amazing Spider-Man, 500 Days of Summer) and includes new origial songs written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, aka Pasek and Paul (La La Land, The Greatest Showman, Dear Evan Hansen). It stars the following:\nThe new Snow White movie is Rated PG for violence, some peril, thematic elements and brief rude humor. This is definitely one for the families. The movie runs for a total of one hour and 49 minutes."

    "full_text": "David Fincher and Brad Pitt are reportedly re-teaming to revive aOnce Upon a Time in Hollywoodsequel script written by original director Quentin Tarantino.\n\nDetails on what could eventually be a groundbreaking entry in Tarantino’s resume come fromThe Playlist, which says the Se7en duo is propping up the unexpected film to come to Netflix, continuing Fincher’s long-lasting relationship with the streaming giant. Should everything proceed according to plan, the currently untitled Once Upon a Time in Hollywood sequel would see Pitt return as stunt-double star Cliff Booth.\nHow such a script came into Fincher’s possession is its own wild story. The Tarantino screenplay is said to be an evolved version of a story previously known asThe Movie Critic, a project previously lined up to be the Pulp Fiction mastermind’s final filmbefore it was suddenly shelved last year. Tarantino was seemingly uninterested in letting the idea fade to black and is getting Fincher to bring it to life.\nThe Playlist’s sources say Netflix paid $20 million to acquire the screenplay with an expected $200 million budget and plans to shoot in California in July – just three months from now. No additional casting details have been confirmed just yet, but Leonardo DiCaprio is not expected to return as Rick Dalton. Fincher and Pitt are putting aside all other projects to focus on this new Once Upon a Time in Hollywood sequel.\nDeadlinelater corroborated The Playlist's findings that a Once Upon a Time in Hollywood sequel is in development. Its sources say Pitt received Tarantino's blessing to present the script to Fincher, resulting in the wildly surprising project that is now in the works.\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood premiered in 2019 and is largely viewed as yet another outstanding entry in the Tarantino pantheon. That said, what could eventually be known as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood 2 has a lot to live up to. The original project came with an unambiguous ending that tied up its story with a brutal bow. However, much of its world has been explored elsewhere.\nIn 2021,Tarantino released a novelizationcovering the movie’s events while expanding upon its take on a 1960s California. It broughta few interesting revelations about Cliff Booth’s pastto the conversation, including an answer to whether or not the dog lover really did kill his wife as teased in the movie. It’s a book that will no doubt carry more meaning when the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood sequel finally sees the light of day, though it’s unclear just how important to the story it will be.\nFor more on Tarantino’s catalog of hit films, you can check outhow the director feels about Once Upon a Time in Hollywoodandhow we feel it stacks up against his other work.

    "title": "Novocaine Review",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-08T17:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/novocaine-review",
    "full_text": "Novocaine is in theaters on March 14, 2025.\n\nEdgar Wright made a name for himself with action comedies like Shaun of the Dead and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World – movies where normal, flawed dudes reluctantly kick ass and get the girl. But it’s been a while since we had a great one of those, so the space was open for directors Dan Berk and Robert Olson – best known for indie films likeSignificant Otherand Villains – to take their own stab at that concept with Novocaine, a gnarly action-comedy romp about a guy with a rare genetic disorder who risks it all to save his one-night stand. Despite its shallow gimmick, Novocaine delivers a sharp script and a fresh take on the hapless hero, as brought to life by the irresistible Jack Quaid of The Boys fame.\nRight off the bat, it’s apparent that Nathan Caine (Quaid) isn’t your typical schlubby hero-by-accident. He’s got a great sleep schedule, he drinks green smoothies for breakfast, and, well, he looks like the progeny of Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan. But growing up withCIPA– an often-fatal condition that makes it impossible for Nathan to feel pain or even temperature – has made for a very sheltered life of trying not to accidentally die. It’s a lonely existence, so after his work crush, Sherry (Amber Midthunder), coaxes Nathan out of his shell and into bed, it’s no wonder that he’s willing to put it all on the line to save her from a trio of kidnappers the very next day. After all, he’s on an all-liquid diet for fear of biting off his own tongue, and this is the woman who fed him hisfirst-everbite of pie.\nNathan might be oblivious to physical harm but he otherwise could not be less suited for hand-to-hand combat, and that contrast is delicious. As he stumbles into vigilante justice he strives – with all the decorum his assistant bank manager job requires – to outrun police detectives, career criminals, and his own mortality. It’s hard not to root for someone who’s down so bad he’ll stick his hand in a deep fryer; someone who pukes in distress after his first kill. It’s not every day you get to see a guy who reeks of having an up-to-date LinkedIn profile learn to fire a stolen gun.\nNathan’s written with care, humor, and specificity – hallmarks of Lars Jacobson’s clever script. There are some guys who are just plain bad, but most characters resist the straightforward morality typical of most action movies. Sherry is an excellent example of that complexity. Though she may be the impetus for Nathan’s spree, she’s no damsel; Nathan, who has recklessly forsaken his Bubble Boy-esque existence for a John Wick-style quest, is clearly the one in distress.\nThe premise is silly and the bloodshed is plentiful, but Novocaine is far from unfeeling. Perhaps its greatest asset is its earnestness. Our wet cat of a protagonist isn’t the only one who risks life and limb for human connection, and while the kidnappers are mostly just sociopathic thugs, one character turns out to be a great foil for Nathan with a very different relationship to pain. By the end, it’s apparent that Novocaine isn’t just about some guy who can’t feel physical pain. This is a story about the emotional agony of vulnerability, and the depths we will go to to share our lives – and our feelings – with other people. It’s set during the Christmas season, but the fact that Novocaine is premiering almost exactly five years after we all went into isolation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic feels somehow more appropriate.\nWe’ve all seen plenty of movies with fish-out-of-water heroes who groan or flail their way through fights. These can lean too far into cynicism, offering so much self-awareness that there is little room to surprise or delight. (For a recent example, see the horror-romanceLove Hurts.) Novocaine, by contrast, effectively sells this well-trod cliche thanks in large part to Quaid, whose character feels grounded despite his wildly unusual circumstances. Quaid brings Nathan to vivid, glorious life, adding a sort of gawky ferality that is a real joy to watch. Humanizing details from the script – like the fact that Nathan’s online handle is MagicNateBall – pair perfectly with Quaid’s impenetrable charm.\nThat’s not to say that the script never crosses the line between clever and cutesy. (His last name shares a syllable with the word “novocaine” – we get it!) But this is a consummate popcorn movie, and it’s invigorating to see a fun, well-made,originalfilm in a cinematic landscape that increasingly feels overtaken by shared-universe sequels and dour dramas. Novocaine goes down easy – or as easily as any movie with gory compound fractures and fingernail removal can.\nNovocaine offers more depth than its gimmicky “man who feels no pain” premise may lead you to believe. This movie breathes new life into old ideas, with an original hero buoyed by the charm of Jack Quaid and a heroine who ably beats the damsel-in-distress allegations. Novocaine is smart, but not so self-aware that it’s likely to alienate anybody; sharp, but not without feeling. This isn’t a game-changer, but it signals a much-needed return to originality for popcorn action movies. Here’s to more of this sort of clever storytelling and character writing that reminds us of a time when seeing movies in theaters was just plain fun."

    "full_text": "Marvel has announced the cast ofAvengers: Doomsdayvia a lengthy livestream that confirmed a further 26 actors set to appear in the superhero movie as well as the start of production. Among the surprises, Channing Tatum will reprise his role as X-Men fan-favorite Gambit.\n\nThe video revealed the MCU actor names, displayed on the back of a series of chairs, alongside their character's musical themes. In a nice touch, Ant-Man star Paul Rudd's chair was tiny, and Patrick Stewart's chair was revealed alongside the iconic X-Men '90s animated series music. Robert Downey Jr., who famously played Iron Man in the MCU and is now down to play Doctor Doom, appeared at the end to sit in his chair before turning to the camera and putting his finger to his mouth to make a \"shhh.\"\nNames shown included Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Vanessa Kirby (Invisible Woman), Pedro Pascal (Mister Fantastic), Joseph Quinn (Human Torch), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Thing), Letitia Wright (Shuri / Black Panther), Winston Duke (M'Baku), Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Tenoch Huerta Mejía (Namor), Simu Liu (Shang-Chi), Anthony Mackie (Captain America), Danny Ramirez (Joaquin Torres / Falcon), Sebastian Stan (Winter Solder), Wyatt Russell (John Walker / U.S. Agent), Florence Pugh (Yelena Belova), Lewis Pullman (Robert Reynolds / Sentry), David Harbour (Red Guardian), and Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost).\nMeanwhile, Fox X-Men veterans Kelsey Grammer, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, and James Marsden are all now set to appear in Avengers: Doomsday, confirming the X-Men are in the film in a big way. Grammer famously played Beast in the Fox X-Men franchise beforemaking his MCU debut via The Marvels' post-credits scene. Stewart played Charles Xavier/Professor X in the X-Men films before appearing briefly in the MCU via Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness as a member of the Illuminati. McKellen, who played Magneto, has yet to appear in the MCU. Neither has Cumming, who played Nightcrawler, Romijn, who played Mystique, nor Marsden, who played Cyclops. It begs the question:is Avengers: Doomsday secretly an Avengers vs. X-Men movie?\nOne of the biggest surprises is the addition of Channing Tatum to the cast. Tatum played fan-favorite X-Men character Gambit in last year's smash hitDeadpool & Wolverine, and is now confirmed to reprise his dream role in Avengers: Doomsday.\nLate last year, MCU chief Kevin Feige teased the introduction of X-Men characters in the \"next few\" MCU movies. Feige told an audience at the Disney APAC Content Showcase in Singapore that fans would see “some X-Men players that you might recognize” in the next few MCU movies, but he stopped short of saying which characters or what movies.\nOn bringing the X-Men into the MCU, Feige added: “I think you will see that continues in our next few movies with some X-Men players that you might recognize.\n“Right after that, the whole story of Secret Wars really leads us into a new age of mutants and of the X-Men. Again, [it’s] one of those dreams come true. We finally have the X-Men back.”\nFeige has also said the X-Men will be an important part of the MCU’s future following Secret Wars. \"When we were preparing for Avengers: Endgame years ago, it was a question of getting to the grand finale of our narrative, and then we had to start all over again after that,” Feige said. “This time, on the road to Secret Wars, we already know very well what the story is going to be until then and afterwards. The X-Men are an important part of that future.”\nAlready confirmed to appear in Doomsday before today's announcement was the aforementionedRobert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom, withBenedict Cumberbatch set to return as Doctor Strange in Secret Wars. Scarlet Witch actress Elizabeth Olsen, meanwhile, had suggestedshe would not be in either Avengers: Secret Wars or Avengers: Doomsday. Given Olsen's name did not appear during the livestream, it looks like that is indeed the case.\nThe question now is, was this an exhaustive look at the cast of Avengers: Doomsday, or are there more actor announcements to come? Assuming itisexhaustive, big-name MCU characters set to miss out include Nick Fury, Hawkeye, Hulk, the Marvels (Captain Marvel, Monica Rambeau, Kamala Khan / Ms. Marvel), Daredevil, Spider-Man, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool, and Wolverine. Captain America star Chris Evans, who was once rumored to return in some form, wasn't on the list either.\nEarlier this month, co-directorsthe Russo brothers said they see Avengers 5 and 6 as a “new beginning”that will lay the foundation for whatever comes next in Phase 7 of the MCU.\n“The only thing I’ll say about the movie is this: we love villains who think they’re the heroes of their own stories,” Joe Russo said. “That’s when they become three-dimensional and they become more interesting. When you have an actor like Robert Downey, you have to create a three-dimensional, well shaped character for the audience. That’s where a lot of our focus is going.”\nAvengers: Doomsday is currently set to arrive in theaters on May 1, 2026, and Secret Wars arrives about a year later in May 2027. Before then,Thunderbolts*comes out in May 2025, TV showIronheartis out in June, and Phase 6 kicks off withThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsin July.\nIn October, Marvel Studios added three untitled movie projects to its 2028 release schedule: February 18, 2028; May 5, 2028; and November 10, 2028. It seems increasingly likely one of these movies is X-Men.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/jason-statham-best-top-movie-moments",
    "full_text": "Daniel Day-Lewis has been hailed as one of the greatest actors in cinematic history. Indeed, he’s won three Academy Awards, which is exactly three more than fellow English actor Mr. Jason Statham. But has Daniel Day-Lewis ever choked a man with a handful of casino chips, K.O.’d a dude with a coin, killed a fella with a spoon, or punched a bloke in thefistwith his ownhead? Jason Statham did all these in thesame movie. There’s just no contest.\n\nStatham has become one of the 21st century’s most dependable action superstars. That’s why it’s exciting that he’s got a new film out now,A Working Man. So to mark the occasion, here are our favourite moments from Jason Statham’s hard-hitting and hilarious career. Because let’s face it: Until they start giving out Oscars for walking through fire, water-skiing blindfolded, or successfully taking up piano at a late age, it’s the least we can do.\nYou ever get the feeling that Jason Statham’s catalogue of action heroes are all the kind of guy who could take down three blokes with his hands tied behind his back? Well, you should, because inHomefrontStatham annihilates three dudes while his hands are tied behind his back. What better way to kick things off than this?\nIf there’s one thing that stung aboutThe Beekeeper, it’s that he’s too sweet on some of the scam call centre employees – letting them scurry out of the building before he blows it up simply because they apologised. We don’t watch Jason Statham movies to see him let the villains live, damn it! Fortunately, Statham partially makes it up to us by trailing the call centre manager, strapping him to his truck, and sending the empty vehicle off the end of a bridge, dragging the screaming scumbag behind it. They say bumblebees aren’t particularly efficient flyers, but at least they fly better than a 1967 Ford F-100.\nLet’s double back to the movie alluded to in the intro, which isWild Card– a film that criminally flopped at the box office despite being directed by the man who bestowed Con Air upon the world, boasting a bonus appearance from Stanley Tucci with hair, and honestly featuring some of the best fight scenes of Statham’s entire career. In the final showdown, Statham guts no less than five gun-toting goons – armed only with a spoon and a butter knife – and walks away without a scratch. Jason Statham: king of knifey spoony.\nPaul W.S. Anderson’s long list of video game adaptations haven’t exactly won the man fistfuls of prestige but, if we’re being honest, he deserves at least a pat on the back for his slightly-camp 2008 killer car feature,Death Race, where he vividly demonstrated a Mad Max: Fury Road-level commitment to crashing giant death trucks an impressive seven-odd years before George Miller actually made that movie. Statham getting the better of the Juggernaut by conspiring with his bitter rival is easily the highlight of the film. The score remains: practical effects - one million, CGI - zero.\nOf course, on the topic of taking down giant monsters, no list of Jason Statham’s most memorable movie moments would be remotely complete without the time the man literally murdered a megalodon with a metal spear inThe Meg.After slicing its guts open from teeth to tail, Statham surfs the giant shark as it leaps skyward, shoving a stick straight into its eyeball in the process. Toppling back into the water, the prehistoric beast is subsequently devoured by dozens of its more diminutive descendants. It doesn’t matter where the predator comes from: If it bleeds, you can kill it.\nSliding in at number seven is one of Statham’s most iconic action roles: Frank Martin,the Transporter. Of course, the 2002 original is basically 90 minutes of Hong Kong-quality fight scenes from prolific action director Corey Yuen, so how do you choose just one moment? The container fight? The axe fight? The bus fight? There area lotof fights. Well, the answer has to be the oil fight, where Frank greases himself up to literally slip through his enemies’ fingers before turning the tables on them with a set of bicycle pedals and a series of savage spinning heel kicks.\nSpeaking of heels, the villainous Deckard Shaw’s heel-face turn in the Fast and the Furious saga was controversial for a while, but ever since Fast 9 confirmed he never actually killed Han during Tokyo Drift, we can all enjoy his past exploits without feeling guilty. Naturally, one particular moment that’s hard to go past is the Hard Boiled-inspired airborne rescue of Dom and Elena’s infant son inThe Fate of the Furious. Jason Statham has enjoyed action aplenty in the Fast saga since his post-credits appearance in Fast & Furious 6, but this mix of gun-fu and jokes about poo is arguably his greatest highlight.\nEarning his spot alongside the heaviest of Hollywood hardmen in Sylvester Stallone’sExpendablesfranchise, Jason Statham’s Lee Christmas has had plenty of time to shine throughout the series, from kicking fellow countryman Scott Adkins into an idling helicopter to firing a flare from the front of a flying boat for a littlefry-and-die. However, his most memorable moment is the brief but brutal basketball court beatdown he gives to his girlfriend’s abusive ex and every one of his useless mates. Christmas may only come around once a year, but when he does, he smashes the crap out of six dudes in about 16 seconds. He’s like Santa, only instead of a nice list he just has a knife list.\nIn an absolutely scene-stealing performance in what’s already an extremely funny film, Jason Statham fully flexes his comedy muscles in 2015’sSpyas Rick Ford: the unkillable secret agent extraordinaire who’s immune to 179 different types of poison and makes his own suits. Statham enjoys plenty of hilarious moments in Spy, but the best is when he regales Melissa McCarthy with tales of his legendary toughness: “I drove a car off a freeway, on top of a train, while I was on fire. Not the car. I was on fire.”\nCome on. You didn’t think we were going to forget the infamousTransporter 2barrel roll, did you? Calm as a cucumber, Frank Martin flings his two-ton Audi upside down to dislodge the bomb strapped beneath it, all with the complete confidence of a man flicking a speck of soot from the shoulder of his suit. Tell your teachers: Physics are cancelled.\nAfter surviving falling several thousand feet from a helicopter, Chev Chelios’ clearly superhuman heart has been stolen by Chinese gangsters. That is the plot ofCrank 2. As such, you shouldn’t be surprised when, at one stage, Chev hallucinates an entire fight at a power station as a souped-up, 100-foot-tall kaiju version of himself, complete with a mask of… his own head. This is a real movie that definitely happened.\nWhat better choice for number one thanSnatch, where Jason Statham – in only his second film appearance after he debuted in Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels – didn’t just shine amongst Hollywood heavyweights like Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, and the late Dennis Farina – he came away with a whole host of the movie’s most-quotable lines. It’s tricky to pick a favourite quip from a movie chock full of them, but Turkish’s iconic response to Tommy’s desire to carry a gun seems like a safe bet (“What is a gun doing in your trousers?” “For protection.” “Protection from what? Zee Germans?”).A safer bet than anything Brick Top suggests, at least.\nDid we miss any of your favourites? Mean Machine? The Mechanic? Hobbs & Shaw? Let us know in the comments."

    "full_text": "The new Minecraft movie has looked interesting from the very virst trailer and, now that it's in theaters, is headed straight forbox office success in 2025. With Jack Black and Jason Momoa plopped into the world ofMinecraft, it's a video game movie that has the potential to be popular with a massive audience of both kids and adults. Minecraft is one of thebest-selling video games of all timethat has infiltrated pretty much every medium, so its jump to a feature film was all but a matter of time. In ourreview of A Minecraft Movie, we found it to be surprisingly funny despite its contraints.Audience reactionshave made it a theater-going experience for the ages.\n\nIf you're planning to watch A Minecraft Movie in theaters, I've gathered all of the details below. For those of you waiting for it to come out on streaming and digital, I've also gathered the latest info I could find about release dates for both.\nA Minecraft Movie, with a wide release date of April 4, is now available in theaters everywhere. To find when and where you can watch the film near you, check the listings featured below for local showtimes.\nWe don't yet have a streaming release date for A Minecraft Movie, but we know thatit will land on Max when it does hit streamingbecause it'sa Warner Bros. project. There is no clear time period when we can expect the movie to make the jump to a streaming service since it depends on how the film does in the box office, but we can make an educated guess based on past Warner Bros. movies. Theatrical windows have shrunk in the last few years, some as short as 14 days before hitting VOD. For a movie with such crossover appeal like this one, we'd bet that it has a longer life in theaters and won't hit streaming for three to four months. That would place thepotential streaming release date sometime in June or July 2025.\nA Minecraft Movie does not currently have a release date for when it will become available to rent or purchase digitally. However, alimited edition steelbook is available for preorder, though without a release date. I'd venture a guess that it will release sometime closer to the end of May 2025.\nThe marketing team has already pushedMinecraft Movie LEGO setsand aMcDonald's collaboration, and we'll likely see even more merchandise over the coming weeks.\nIf you haven't been keeping up with the latest trailers for A Minecraft Movie, here's a quick synopsis of the film directly from the Warner Bros. website:\n\"Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits – Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks) – find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination.

    "full_text": "You’d think a five-hour long video of some chairs with names on them would be devoid of Marvel Cinematic Universe Easter eggs, but some fans believe there’s one hiding in the shadows.\n\nTo recap, this weekMarvel announced the cast of Avengers: Doomsday in a video that slowly revealed chairs with MCU actor names on them. The video confirmed an additional 26 actors set to appear in the superhero mash-up alongside Robert Downey Jr.’s Doctor Doom. It took nearly five and a half hours to do so.\nMost have now moved on from the video todebating what the cast announcement means for Avengers: Doomsday itself, but some have stuck with it, analyzing the chairs and even the shadows to within an inch of their lives. And now, some believe they’ve found… something.\nThe appropriately-named redditor True_Confusion_295 said “I feel like a conspiracy theorist circling things in red” when they pointed out that a shadow cast by one of the chairs forms what looks like an X on top of an A. What does that mean? Avengers vs. X-Men, of course.\nMarvel surprised many by announcing a number of returning stars from Fox’s X-Men films. Fox X-Men veterans Kelsey Grammer, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, and James Marsden are all now confirmed to appear in Avengers: Doomsday. Grammer famously played Beast in the Fox X-Men franchise beforemaking his MCU debut via The Marvels' post-credits scene. Stewart played Charles Xavier/Professor X in the X-Men films before appearing briefly in the MCU via Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness as a member of the Illuminati. McKellen, who played Magneto, has yet to appear in the MCU. Neither has Cumming, who played Nightcrawler, Romijn, who played Mystique, nor Marsden, who played Cyclops. Even Channing Tatum gets to play Gambit again after his star turn in Deadpool & Wolverine. It begs the question:is Avengers: Doomsday secretly an Avengers vs. X-Men movie?\nPerhaps, when the movie is finally revealed, fans will return to this moment to declare the hotly anticipated superhero scrap was first teased in the shadow of a chair. Or not.\nLetters in shadows isn’t the only conspiracy theory coming out of Marvel’s announcement video. At the end, Robert Downey Jr. does a slightly unnerving ‘shhh’ to the camera as he brings his finger up to his mouth. Why? Could it be a sort of ‘don’t tell anyone’ warning because production is about to begin? Could it be a tease for Avengers: Secret Wars? Could it bea nod to more casting announcements to come?\nOr could it be a reference to Agatha in WandaVision? And, in turn, the unexpected appearance of Scarlet Witch,despite actress Elizabeth Olsen suggesting she's not?\nDoom x Agatha.#AvengersDoomsdaypic.twitter.com/3LX38W5Kc0\nEarlier this month, co-directorsthe Russo brothers said they see Avengers 5 and 6 as a “new beginning”that will lay the foundation for whatever comes next in Phase 7 of the MCU.\n“The only thing I’ll say about the movie is this: we love villains who think they’re the heroes of their own stories,” Joe Russo said. “That’s when they become three-dimensional and they become more interesting. When you have an actor like Robert Downey, you have to create a three-dimensional, well shaped character for the audience. That’s where a lot of our focus is going.”\nAvengers: Doomsday is currently set to arrive in theaters on May 1, 2026, and Secret Wars arrives about a year later in May 2027. Before then,Thunderbolts*comes out in May 2025, TV showIronheartis out in June, and Phase 6 kicks off withThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsin July.\nIn October, Marvel Studios added three untitled movie projects to its 2028 release schedule: February 18, 2028; May 5, 2028; and November 10, 2028. It seems increasingly likely one of these movies is X-Men.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

    "title": "A Minecraft Movie Review",
    "publishedAt": "2025-04-02T19:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-review-jack-black-jason-momoa",
    "full_text": "A Minecraft Movie immediately creates a sticky paradox for itself. Clearly hoping to follow in the footsteps of a project likeThe Lego Movie, this video-game adaptation wants to pay tribute to the open-world flexibility and creativity ofMinecraftwhile staying well within the framework of the game itself, which means including all of the expected blocky visual touchstones and including an obligatory number of cutesy gamer in-jokes. The surprise of the movie is how long it’s able to delay the latter material – long enough, it turns out, forNapoleon Dynamitedirector Jared Hess to get his foot in the door, expertly adapting his deadpan comic-strip style for a children’s fantasy.\n\nHess’ foray into big-time franchise filmmaking reunites him with Jack Black, the star of his 2006 slapstick adventure,Nacho Libre– and no one can accuse Black of half-assing his way through a paycheck job here. As Steve, a man who “yearned for the mines” as a child and discovers a portal into the magical Overworld as an adult, he throws off the shackles of workaday existence with such relish that his torrent of movie-opening narration feels enthusiastic, rather than blandly explanatory. The short of it: Bad-guy pigs covet the “orb” (like everything else in the Overworld, it’s block-shaped, not an actual orb) that Steve has discovered, so he sends his faithfulwolf-dog, Dennis, to hide it in the real world.\nHess really connects with his Dynamite roots – throwback fashions, drier-than-dry non sequitur – and setting in that real world, where he pauses Steve’s story to follow siblings Natalie (Emma Myers, fromWednesday) and Henry (Sebastian Hansen) as they relocate to a small town in Idaho. There, creative, school-age misfit Henry clicks with Garrett Garrison (Jason Momoa), a former gaming champion who now runs a retro pop-culture junk store on the verge of foreclosure. Natalie, meanwhile, meets Dawn (Danielle Brooks), a friendly real estate agent who moonlights as a kind of mobile zookeeper.\nIn a movie for grown-ups, this litany of quirk might seem a bit much: Natalie is a young woman of indeterminate age who gets a job running social media for a local potato-chip factory; Henry tinkers with his design for a working jetpack. For a kid picture, though, it’s sweetly silly, even distinctive; the kitschy tater-tots-and-alpacas ambience is pure Hess. Momoa in particular makes a surprisingly good fit for the filmmaker’s sensibility, playing a less bullying version of the blustery Napoleon Dynamite sensei Rex Kwon Do. In fact, the first 30 to 40 minutes of A Minecraft Movie have enough big laughs that it’s almost a disappointment when Henry, Garrett, Natalie, and Dawn stumble upon the orb and wind up accidentally sucked into the Overworld.\nEventually they meet up with Steve, who provides some standard gameplay tutelage in advance of their quest. The quest itself is conceptually muddy, confusingly and erratically presented as some combination of saving Steve’s beloved Dennis, protecting the orb, and eventually bringing the four displaced travelers home. The seams of the six-writer screenplay show frequently, like when characters make plans and then deviate from them without comment as if the actors are all working from different versions of the script. Based on the uninspired action sequences – digital hordes running and flying around in a manner better suited for an in-gameLord of the Ringsfan film – there aren't many big-budget fantasy epics in Hess' future. But A Minecraft Movie stays light on its feet nonetheless by continually pausing for slapstick silliness and cartoonish little sketches like an ongoing and delightfully pointless subplot involving Jennifer Coolidge and a resident of the Overworld.\nEventually, the more antic side of things takes over, and the various CG landscapes populated by blocky people and creatures start to feel repetitive. It’s like a slightly more polished version of someone’s playthrough video, only with a couple of big stars getting thrown around the screen. What A Minecraft Movie misses from Minecraft the game is its combination of minutiae and vastness; as much as the movie advertises its subject’s creative flexibility, it shortchanges any potential obsessiveness in favor of making the Overworld look a little more like something out of aMariogame. The parallelsto Black’s other video-game-movie gig– and aspirations to its popularity with the playground set – become especially clear when Steve chases the next “Peaches” by riffing out no fewer than three little songs. (On the other hand, it’s hard to resist Black bringing his goofball-rock-star shtick to Gen Alpha.) As with so many game-based movies, the mismatch between what each medium does best isn’t really reconciled by A Minecraft Movie. But turning the world’s best-selling video game into Jared Hess’s best feature in years is, admittedly, a pretty creative undertaking.\nFor a big-studio adaptation of a massively popular video-game, A Minecraft Movie lets a surprising amount of its director’s personality shine through. Napoleon Dynamite’s Jared Hess manages to fit some laugh-out-loud silliness into his Overworld saga before surrendering to the obligations of CG-driven fantasy adventure. Thematically, A Minecraft Movie offers a pat world-is-what-you-make-it lesson, but Jack Black and Jason Momoa in particular sell it with a lot of comic enthusiasm."

    "full_text": "The Rule of Jenny Pen begins streaming on Shudder Friday, March 28.\n\nThe grueling but entertaining psychological thriller The Rule of Jenny Pen introduces one of the strangest movie villains you’ll ever meet: Jenny Pen, a baby doll puppet with tiny plastic hands and a bulbous head. The puppet’s eyes are long gone, so any light in the room tends to shine through the open sockets, giving them a disconcertingly eerie glow; her M.O. is one of mental and physical torture, a battery of distressing taunts aimed at the vulnerable residents of a New Zealand nursing home. But this is noChild’s PlayorM3GANsituation. Jenny carries out the petulant whims of her owner, played by John Lithgow in a formidable portrayal whose bullying energy could only be matched and countered by similarly seasoned pros Geoffrey Rush and George Henare.\nThe Rule of Jenny Pen is adapted from a short story by Owen Marshall, a New Zealander who specializes in antagonists like Dave Crealy (Lithgow): people who are so intensely aggressive that they can easily manipulate the meek. In this particular story, Dave meets a worthy adversary: Stefan Mortensen (Rush), an imperious judge who arrives at the home after suffering a stroke, and makes it his mission to expose this monster who stalks the halls at night, ending each intrusion into his neighbors’ rooms with the unsettling inquiry “Who rules?” The problem is that in the daylight hours, Dave comes across as a sweetly addled eccentric, beloved by the staff. And Stefan? He is one prickly pear. Throughout the movie, Stefan struggles to get anyone to believe that Dave and Jenny are trouble, mainly because, as written and performed, Stefan is so rude to everyone, all of the time.\nStefan isn’t easy to root for. When we first meet him, he’s sitting at the front of his courtroom, blaming the parents of a sexual-assault victim for not taking better care of their child. Later, at the nursing home, he complains about having to share a room with Tony Garfield (Henare): a former rugby star, a hero to his fellow Maori and a New Zealand national treasure. It’s a credit to Rush that even though Stefan can be demanding and petty, he also comes across as heroic in his own way, standing up for simple human dignity. Henare is also outstanding, projecting a genuine sweetness and inner strength in the face of Dave’s relentless cruelty.\nStefan and Tony eventually bond over the mutual hatred of Dave, who resents Tony for being popular and singles him out for discipline at Jenny Pen’s wee hands. When Dave comes into Stefan and Tony’s room after dark, he tells racist jokes in the puppet’s voice, and then yanks on Tony’s catheter. Because both Stefan and Tony have physical ailments that make it hard for them to get away, they’re trapped with this madman and his devil-doll – and we’re trapped along with them. These scenes are intense and disturbing, but effective. They make the movie scarier and the situation feel more hopeless.\nDave and Jenny’s reign of terror takes on more or less the same form, day after day, and because of this, The Rule of Jenny Pen can get a little repetitive. Director James Ashcroft (who co-wrote the screenplay with Eli Kent) emphasizes the banal irritations of an institution, in ways that spread some of that discomfort to us. A scene like the one where an entertainer in a hideously grinning mask sings the insipid ditty “I’ve Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts” is meant to be grating – and it certainly is.\nBut Lithgow, Rush, and Henare are consistently exciting to watch, as their three old men scheme against and sabotage each other. There’s a darkly comic undercurrent to this movie, evident in the gusto of these performances – and also running beneath all the creepy shots of Jenny Pen, who looms large in the frame, with a blank expression that is equal parts ominous and hilarious.\nMore importantly, Ashcroft does a terrific job of capturing the frustrations of a man like Stefan, who was used to bossing people around, right up until the moment when his brain went haywire. The director follows in the footsteps of Australian and New Zealand filmmakers like George Miller and Peter Jackson, who take the exciting parts of the action, fantasy and horror genres – all the fights, chases, murders, intimidation, and wonder – and put them into movies about underdogs fighting for some kind of personal freedom. Stefan has no family to come visit, and his condition keeps deteriorating; but he’ll be damned if some dumb puppet is going to get the better of him. Stefan may not be the hero we want in the darkest of times, but he could well be the one who is obnoxious enough to see justice done.\n\nSet in a New Zealand nursing home, the entertaining and creepy The Rule of Jenny Pen stars John Lithgow as an eccentric old man who uses a baby doll puppet to torment the home’s other residents. Geoffrey Rush plays a misanthropic newcomer who becomes an offbeat kind of hero when he tries to restore some order, with the help of his roommate, played by George Henare. Although this psychological thriller can be uncomfortable to watch at times, the performances – combined with the disturbing puppet imagery – bring a lot of life and imagination to a story about a petty dictator and an unlikely rebel."

    "full_text": "\nThere’s something uncanny about the office.\nIt has furniture and lights and doors, but nothing you would ever put in your own house. You eat in a little room they tell you to, wear drab office clothes and make cordial office friends. It’syou, but it’s not yourlife.It just kind of feels that way sometimes. A drop-shipped dupe of the designer handbag that is the human experience.\nSeverance is a show that explores the outer limits of this artificiality.It’s a paranoid Philip K. Dick mind-melterin a prestige TV package, exploring the unsettling otherness of an office setting that’s just slightly outside the bounds of reality.\nMany of us have little choice but to spend much of our short time on earth existing in an office, which means we’re about as familiar with the look and feel of the space as we are with our own faces. When things are even just a little, tiny bit off, we notice. That’s the theory behind the “uncanny valley,” the idea that the closer humanoid robots look to real people, the more that subtle, slightly-askew differences will make them exponentially more freaky.\nIf a robot is a cartoony abstraction like Bender Rodriguez, people are totally fine with it. But if you deck him out in some fake skin over a highly articulated endoskeleton, ourmonkey-brain “flight” responsescan’t help but kick in. It’s how our brains evolved to perceive things, possibly to prevent us mingling with other early hominids.\nThinkDisney’s Hall of Presidents, or all thoseandroid girlfriendson display at CES. The more something resembles the real thing, the more that small, almost imperceivable differences matter. Achieving perfection is essentially the only antidote to this phenomenon.\nThe uncanny valley is what makes the CG animation of Bob Zemeckis movies so skin-crawling. It’s why we cringed through Mass Effect: Andromeda. The reason AI generated babies raise instinctual alarm bells. When something is notquiteright, it can feelverywrong.\nIn Severance, Lumon Headquarters is located in a fake town called Kier in a fake state called PE situated deep within the uncanny valley. The facility features sprawling, identical hallways of impeccably sterile decor. Dozens of meticulously labelled doors that can lead anywhere from a cookie-cutter conference room to a deranged faction of goat-keepers.\nLumon isn’t the workplace we know, it’s the one we visit in our nightmares, the mundane ones where you completely forgot about a project you were supposed to be working on for months and it’s dueright now. It’s a dreamlike space of fuzzy details and a barely-audible buzzing of dread.\nSeverance is heavily informed by the aesthetic of “liminal spaces,” impossibly vast, eerily familiar environments designed to instill a sense of dread and confusion. Imagine a dead mall that sprawls on for infinity, or a surreal fast food playplace with slides that don’t end and ball pits that are deeper than the diameter of the planet.\nLiminal spaces came to prominence thanks to the spread of the Backrooms, acreepypasta that first appeared on 4chanback in 2019. “In the Backrooms,” wrote the surprisingly eloquent poster who will forever remain anon, there’s “nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in.”\nThe Backrooms is a true internet original,a memetic masterpiece that belongs to no one and every one. It spawned a series of short films,countless streamer-bait jump scare gameson Steam, and, soon, a major motion picture from A24.Severance creator Dan Erickson citedThe Backrooms, as well as its video game predecessor The Stanley Parable, as one of many inspirations for the show’s dreamlike unreality.\nHe also named The Matrix, The Truman Show, and Dark City, films featuring characters who realize they are trapped in an obscene simulacrum of life, manipulated by powerful forces beyond their control or understanding. Even before our naive heroes learn the truth, they begin their journey by seeing the slight cracks in the seemingly perfect facades around them– enlightenment achieved by way of the uncanny valley effect.\nThe notion ofawakening from a constructed realityruns deep within Severance, not only thematically but aesthetically. The Truman Show, in particular, with its deliberately anachronistic clockwork world, seems to inform the show's interpretation of the timeless essence of the office.\nLumon’s design language isn't a pastiche of any particular era, though the earth tone interiors and Brutalist tech evoke the ugly interiors of the ‘60s and ‘70s. The severed floor exists outside of any specific time or place the same way its employees exist outside of their real lives. It’s a boiled-down, hyperreal, evocative impression of what a workplace is.It’s not the office, it’s Officecore.\nThere’s been copious discussion about how Season 2 of Severance doesn’t quite live up to the high bar set by its predecessor. Some attribute that to unsatisfying follow-ups to the first season’s revelations. Others might point to a ramping up of the mystery box-ification that has plagued buzzworthy TV shows since Lost.\nFor myself, I’ve found the show slightly less interesting since it shifted its focus away from the workplace. Outdoor team-building exercises, diversions to hellish hometowns, and an increased emphasis on the outside world has diminished what made the show so special in the first place: the unsettling excursion into the uncanny valley of our artificial office lives."

    "full_text": "With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its wayandits audience.\n\nCapcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.\nBut in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.\n2016 was a bad year for Capcom.\nThe big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.\nThis was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.\nAll of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .\nAchieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.\nCapcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4.\n2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema.\nUnfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.\n“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.\nThis directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op.\nThis downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.\nBut it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.\nThis slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.\nIt was clear something needed to change.\nBy the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability.\nWhile neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.\n“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”\nThose constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6.\n\"We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V,\" Nakayama says. \"And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title.\"\nAll this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards.“There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.\n“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”\nThe team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.\nThere was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master.\n“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.”\nStreet Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series.\nWhile they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.\nWhile Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.\nAround the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience.\n“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”\nIf you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.\n“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”\nItsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance.\nNo other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened.\nFirstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.\n“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”\nMonster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.\nThis created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.\nBut the reality was that Monster Hunterdidhave fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.\nReleased in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.\n“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”\nIt was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”\nIt wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world.\n“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”Tsujimoto says.\nOne important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.\nThis explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.\n“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”\nMonster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call.\n“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&D teams were divided into R&D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”\nTakeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.\nThere were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.\n“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.\nThe game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series.\nBut Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time.\n“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.\nThe result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history.\nNaturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?\nAmpo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”\nBut despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.\nAround the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.\n“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.”\nItsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.\nThe 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. \"Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively,\" Itsuno says. \"When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”\nThis vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should.\nAmpo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, \"So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.”\nThis meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.\n“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”\nSince 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.\nFocusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat.\nBut what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.\nMany of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever.\nWhen asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”\nMonster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”\nMatt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor."

    "full_text": "In case you missed the news, Bruce Wayne is getting a new look when DC Comicsrelaunches its flagship Batman series this September. Artist Jorge Jiménez has designed a new Batsuit that brings the classic blue cape and cowl back into the spotlight. After almost 90 years on the stands, DC is still tweaking the Dark Knight’s iconic costume.\n\nBut how does the new Batsuit measure up to the classics? What are the greatest Batman costumes of all time? We’ve handpicked our 10 favorite Batsuits from the comics, ranging from the original Golden Age costume to more modern reinterpretations like Batman Incorporated and Batman Rebirth. Scroll down to see them all.\nAnd if Batman movies are more your speed, make sure you check outour ranked list of all the movie Batsuits.\n1989’s Batman movie introduced a radically different, all-black Batsuit that remains one of the Dark Knight’s most iconic suits in any medium. DC never fully committed to porting that costume over to the comics (outside ofactual Burton-Verse tie-ins like Batman ‘89), but they did introduce a Batsuit inspired by the movies in the 1995 storyline “Troika.”\nThis new Batsuit adopted the all-black approach to Batman’s body but retained a more traditional blue cape and cowl. It even added more extreme elements like spikes on Batman’s boots, although those elements were toned down after the suit’s initial introduction. Regardless, the result was a more intimidating and stealthy Batsuit that became the default look for the Caped Crusader for the remainder of the ‘90s.\nWhen Bruce Wayne returned following his apparent death in 2008’s Final Crisis, DC celebrated with the launch of a new series, Batman Incorporated, and a new costume designed by David Finch. That Batman Inc. suit is notable both for bringing back the classic yellow oval around the Bat emblem and for ditching the black trunks.\nIn many ways, the Batman Inc. suit feels like a more successful and visually cohesive version of what DC tried to accomplish with Batman’s New 52 suit a couple of years later. It introduced a more functional quality to Batman’s look, creating the impression that the Batsuit was less spandex than a true suit of armor, yet it avoided mucking up the design with too many stray lines. It also helped create some much-needed visual distinction between Bruce and Dick Grayson, who was also serving as Batman at the time.\nThe only element that slightly holds back the Batman Inc. look is the slightly goofy-looking armored codpiece. We’re not sure what the thinking was there.\nThe most recent creation on this list, there’s a reason the Absolute Batman Batsuit makes such a strong first impression. This is Batman at his most imposing.\nAbsolute Batman takes place in a rebooted DCU where Bruce Wayne lacks many of the advantages of his traditional counterpart, like a mansion and billions of dollars. Still, he manages to create quite an impressive crimefighting arsenal. Nearly every inch of this Batsuit is a weapon, from the razor-sharp ear daggers to the removable Bat emblem that doubles as a battle axe. Even the cape is completely redesigned, consisting of several flexible, arm-like tendrils.\nUltimately, though, it’s the sheer size of this Batman that makes the Absolute suit stand out. Writer Scott Snyder jokingly referred to Absolute Batman as “the Batman who lifts,” and you can see why.\nIn the alternate timeline of Flashpoint, Joe Chill killed a young Bruce Wayne, leading to a grieving Thomas Wayne becoming Batman instead. This darker, very different Batman needs a darker, very different Batsuit, and he got one in the form of a costume that drops the traditional yellow elements in favor of bold red accents. The Bat emblem, utility belt, and leg holsters are all a deep crimson, creating a unique and cool look. Couple that with the dramatic shoulder spikes on the cape and the fact that this Batman is known to wield guns and a sword, and you have one of the most visually arresting takes on an alternate universe Batman.\nArtist Lee Bermejo has drawn and painted Batman a lot over the years, from the Batman/Deathblow crossover to the Joker graphic novel to theinfamous Batman: Damned. In that time, Bermejo has established a distinctive and very striking take on the iconic Batsuit, one unlike any other at DC Comics.\nBermejo’s Batsuit is about as far from the typical spandex look as you can get. This is armor, pure and simple,and the artist’s Batman is as much about function as he is form. But the goal isn’t necessarily realism here. Bermejo’s Batman is also a haunting figure, one mired in dirt and grime and a certain Gothic quality. This Batsuit, as much as any other, inspired the look of Robert Pattinson’s Dark Knight in 2022’s The Batman.\nThe DC multiverse is a vast place, and we’ve seen countless variations of the Batsuit appear on numerous worlds. That being said, none can truly measure up to Gotham by Gaslight’s Batman. It’s as if the character was made for this steampunk Victorian setting. The Batsuit perfectly translates into this bold revamp that trades skintight spandex for stitched leather and a billowing cloak.\nOf course, it helps that the original Gotham by Gaslight series was illustrated by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. Mignola’s Batman is truly iconic, bathed in shadow and looking as if he were chiseled out of raw granite. And even though Mignola’s DC days are long behind him, this incarnation of the character lives on throughfollow-up stories like Gotham by Gaslight: The Kryptonian Age.\nIt says a lot about the original Bob Kane/Bill Finger-designed Batsuit that the design has survived with only modest changes for the better part of 90 years. All the right ingredients for a truly iconic superhero look were there from the start.\nBut in addition to serving as the basis for every Batsuit since, the Golden Age design is also notable for boasting some interesting features you don’t normally see elsewhere. The curved ears on Batman’s cowl give him an even more menacing vibe, while the purple gloves add a welcome pop of color. Even the cape is different in a fun way, being more akin to actual bat wings than a traditional superhero cape. It’s always exciting to see modern artists revisit this design.\nFor the majority of their hugely popular run on DC’s flagship Batman series, Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo focused on the New 52 costume. As we’ve already covered, that suit served as a notable attempt at updating the Caped Crusader’s look with a more modern, tactical bent, but that approach has been done better elsewhere. Case in point, Capullo’s own redesign that debuted just in time for the DC Rebirth relaunch.\nBatman’s Rebirth costume is an upgrade on the New 52 suit in pretty much every way. It retains the tactical look while also downplaying some of the extraneous lines and details. It brings some much-needed color back into Batman’s look both with the yellow outline around the Bat emblem and the distinctive purple inner lining of the cape (a throwback to Batman’s Golden Age roots). It’s a bit of a shame that DC phased out this Batsuit after only a couple of years. As far as modern redesigns go, this is the one to beat.\nThe late ‘60s and ‘70s were a very transformational time for DC’s Batman comics. The books veered away from the camp that defined Batman’s Silver Age adventures and the live-action TV series toward more serious action/adventure and detective stories. Three artists really came to define Batman’s look in this period - Neal Adams, Jim Aparo, and José Luis García-López.\nIt’s not that these artists dramatically changed the makeup of Batman’s costume. This is the same blue cape and cowl and Bat emblem with yellow oval that was popularized by the TV series. But what unites Adams, Aparo, and Garcia-López’s work is the physicality they brought to the character. Gone was the burly brawler of the Silver Age, replaced by a leaner and more lithe Batman. Batman is basically a ninja superhero, so it makes sense that he be built more like a gymnast than a bodybuilder.\nFor many fans, this is still the standard by which all other Batman costumes are judged. That’s especially thanks to Garcia-López, whose art has adorned bedsheets, lunchboxes, T-shirts, and countless other Batman merch over the years.\nJeph Loeb and Jim Lee’s Hush storyline is often regarded as the start of the modern era of Batman comics. That’s thanks to Lee’s instantly iconic redesign of the Batsuit as much as anything else.\nWith the Hush costume, Lee brought a new level of elegant simplicity to the Batsuit. Gone is the yellow oval that persisted for decades, to be replaced by a sleek, black emblem. Lee’s knack for rendering dynamic, detailed, and very powerful superhero physiques is on full display in his Batman. Readers needed to believe that this Dark Knight could face down a gauntlet of his greatest foes – and Superman for good measure, and they certainly did.\nThe Hush redesign immediately became the default look for Batman going forward. Lee created a clear model that subsequent artists like Andy Kubert and Tony Daniel followed closely. While individual artists varied in whether they chose the blue or black cape and cowl, the rest of the details remained consistent. It’s telling that, after a period of focusing on more armored Batman costumes in the New 52 and DC Rebirth eras, DC eventually threw in the towel and went back to the Hush costume. It just plain works.\nArtist Jorge Jiménez is no stranger to Batman at this point, but he’ll be debuting a new Batsuit when he and writer Matt Fractionkick off DC’s relaunched Batman series in September 2025.\nThe newest Batsuit isn’t a massive deviation from the now-standard Hush costume, though it does have a few interesting embellishments all its own. Where most artists in recent years have gravitated toward the black cape and cowl, Jiménez is bringing back the blue. Not only that, the cape is now heavily shaded, creating a stark contrast between the inner and older folds and bringing to mind Bruce Timm’s Batman: The Animated Series look. Even the Bat emblem is blue now, as well as sporting a bigger and more angular shape.\nAfter all this time, it’s great to see Batman still trying out new looks. But will the latest redesign have the staying power of Batman’s most iconic suits? Only time will tell.\nFor more Batman fun, check outIGN's top 27 Batman comics and graphic novels.\nJesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

    "full_text": "As any younger sibling who grew up on Mario platformers knows, Luigi is gaming's ultimate Player 2. Nintendo's green-capped member of the Mario Bros. has lived a lifetime in the shadow of his older twin Mario, only stepping out for a taste of solo stardom in his ghostbusting Luigi's Mansion series.\n\nAs we move closer toSwitch 2, we’re celebrating another console generation of Luigi and Player 2s everywhere with a complete list of every Luigi game on Switch.\nThere are 17 games on Switch that let you play as Luigi. He’s the main character in only two games (Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD and Luigi’s Mansion 3) and the co-lead in one (Mario & Luigi: Brothership).\nLuigi’s first starring role on Switch was inLuigi’s Mansion 3, the third entry in the character’s only solo series to date. Luigi’s Mansion 3 sees our timid hero and his green gooey clone team up with Professor E. Gadd to battle ghosts and save his friends from King Boo’s haunted hotel.\nLuigi’s Mansion 2 HDis a remake of the 2013 Nintendo 3DS game Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon. This second game in the spooky series sees Luigi ghostbusting his way through the mansions of Evershade Valley to once again capture King Boo and save his brother.\nSure, it's not exclusively a 'Luigi game,' butMario & Luigi: Brothershipcertainly puts the brothers on even footing. Brothership is the first release in the Mario & Luigi series since Paper Jam in 2014. Players take on the role of both brothers, who must traverse puzzles and platforming challenges to restore the kingdom of Concordia.\nThe first Switch game to feature Luigi as a playable character wasMario Kart 8 Deluxe. Luigi appears as a middleweight racer with a well-balanced stat distribution that slightly favors speed and handling. His appearance in an ad for the original Wii U version of Mario Kart 8 spawned theLuigi Death Stare meme.\nLuigi next appeared in the Nintendo-Ubisoft collaborationMario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. The tactical RPG features both Luigi and Rabbid Luigi, a Rabbid who dresses (and often behaves) like his human counterpart, as possible party members.\nLuigi hit the court as one of 16 playable launch characters in 2018’sMario Tennis Aces. As is often true for Luigi in Mario sports games, he’s a balanced, “all-around” character in Aces. His specialty shot, Pipe Cannon, blasts him into the air to set him up for a powerful spike.\nLuigi is one of 20 playable characters inSuper Mario Party. The younger of the Mario Bros. has appeared alongside his brother in every Mario Party game to date, including the two others further down this list. This is the first Mario Party game released for Switch and Nintendo’s ninth best-selling game on the platform,according to the company.\nLuigi appears inSuper Smash Bros. Ultimateas an unlockable character. He is one of 12 characters to be playable in all five Smash games. According toLumiRank’s2025 tier list, which compiled the opinions of 93 ranked Smash players, Luigi is an A+-tier fighter and the 18th best overall.\nLuigi is a playable character in the 2019 platformerNew Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe. This is an expanded version of NSMBU for Wii U that includes the expansion New Super Luigi U. Luigi stars as the main character in this expansion, which incorporates his higher jump, remixes levels from the base game, and adds a 100-second timer to each level.\nAlongside Mario, Toad, and Toadette, Luigi is one of four playable characters inSuper Mario Maker 2. The level-building platformer allows players to create their own Mario levels using assets from Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, New Super Mario Bros. U, and Super Mario 3D World.\nLike the original Wii U release,Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Furycan be played entirely as Luigi. Here, he controls similarly to Mario, albeit with a slightly higher jump and slightly less traction, making him play a bit more ‘floaty’ and ‘slippery’ than his red-capped counterpart.\nLuigi hit the links with Mario and friends inMario Golf: Super Rush. One of 22 playable characters, he boasts decent control and excellent speed stats, making him a great option for Super Rush’s new Speed Golf mode. His special shot, Ice Flower Freeze, freezes the ground upon the ball’s impact, creating a hazardous area for opponents.\nLuigi returns for the second iteration of Mario Party on Switch:Mario Party Superstars. Unlike Super Mario Party before it, Superstars is not an original game but rather a modern collection of minigames, boards, and mechanics from the series’ past.\nMario Strikers: Battle League Football, the latest Mario soccer/football game, features Luigi as one of 16 playable characters. Luigi is a well-balanced footballer who excels in technique, a skill that determines a character’s ability to dribble, curve their shot, and shoot accurately.\nLuigi (and Rabbid Luigi) returned for Ubisoft and Nintendo’s tactical sequel,Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Luigi is labeled a Sneak Attacker due to his ranged weaponry and low health.\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder, the latest 2D Mario platformer, features Luigi as a playable alternative to Mario. The difference between the two characters here is purely aesthetic, as the Mario Bros. play identically to one another.\nUnsurprisingly, Luigi is playable inSuper Mario Party Jamboree, the biggest and arguably best game in Nintendo’s flagship party series. In addition to being a playable character, Luigi appears as part of Jamboree’s new Buddy mechanic, where he has the chance to change a player’s dice rolls from their initial numbers to 10s.\nThe next time you'll be able to play as Luigi is anew Mario Kart game, expected to release alongside theSwitch 2, that features double the usual amount of racers. Yes, that means24 racerson each track. Otherwise, I'm sure Mario will bring Luigi along for whatever his next adventure is. Plenty more games arerumoredto be releasing with Nintendo's next console generation, and the next updates will likely come out of aNintendo Direct scheduled for April 2.\nJordan covers games, shows, and movies as a freelance writer for IGN."

    "full_text": "I think today might be the day my wallet throws in the towel. Woot is coming in hot with one of thebest PS5 game dealsI’ve seen all year, and Sony’s decided we’ve all earned a full-blown audio upgrade. Between the markdowns onnoise-canceling headphones,portable speakers, andhome theater gear, it's giving \"treat yourself\" energy with \"I won’t regret this at all\" delusion.\n\nI want at least three of these, but I’m pretending to be financially responsible and only putting two in my cart. If you’ve been eyeballing anything fromhigh-end headphonestosmart display cases for your action figures (I meancollectibles), now’s probably the best time to stop window shopping and start adding to your cart.\nThis Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code \"IFPRZAZ\" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16\" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.\n$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.\nI think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.\nIf you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.\nAt $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.\n$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.\nThis speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.\nCrisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.\nThis speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.\nBass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.\nXM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.\nA wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.\nMy living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.\nI didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.\nThis TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.\nI want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.\nThis one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.\nIf you're searching for your next new game to play,Humble Choice Marchis now live, and this is the perfect bundle to discover something new! This month, Homeworld 3 headlines the bundle, with other PC games like Wild Hearts, Pacific Drive, Zau, and Gravity Circuit also included.

    "title": "My Hero Academia: Vigilantes Premiere Review",
    "publishedAt": "2025-04-07T15:45:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/my-hero-academia-vigilantes-premiere-review",
    "full_text": "The first episode of My Hero Academia: Vigilantes is now streaming on Crunchyroll.\n\nMy Hero Academia is nearing its conclusion, but its first seven seasons – with their focus on the heroes-in-training of U.A. High School – have only shown us a sliver of a fascinating world where most people have superpowers (a.k.a. Quirks) and some parlay their Quirk into a lucrative career. Enter My Hero Academia: Vigilantes, an adaptation of the manga of the same name written by Hideyuki Furuhashi and illustrated by Betten Court. This is both a spin-off and a prequel to the main show,, and it’s not only a worthy expansion of the My Hero Academia universe, but a dazzling anime whose visual style pays tribute to classic superhero comics.\nThe anime follows Koichi Haimawari, an 18-year-old with a desire to help people despite having a less-than-stellar Quirk. His power allows him to travel quickly across any flat surface – as long as he makes contact with that surface with at least three limbs. Unfortunately, he’s no Flash: at top speed, he only moves about as fast as a bicycle. In many ways, Koichi is like My Hero Academia lead Deku: Both are big-hearted optimists and admirers of the world’s greatest superhero, All Might. In others, he’s a different kind of superhero for MHA: An everyman. The premiere does a lot of work to establish Koichi’s relatability.  Sure he has a Quirk, but it’s not one that’s useful for superheroics. He tries to help people, but cowers when things get too real.\nEven in the first episode, it is clear Vigilantes is giving audiences a different perspective on My Hero Academia. This is not a show about big villains with grand schemes fighting the A-listers. Its concerns are smaller, like the frustration of a convenience-store work being robbed by a small-time vandal with Wolverine claws. These are the villains that aren't prioritized or even acknowledged by cops or heroes. It’s in line with the parent series: The best parts of MHA’s world-building involve the way regular people view hero society; in its earliest goings, it portrayed heroes as celebrities who sometimes cared more about endorsements than saving lives. Vigilantes promises to be a fascinating new spin on that idea, with a street-level view of a world where superpowers don’t just exist, but are common.\nWithout a doubt, the visuals are the main draw of the series so far. Director Kenichi Suzuki (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders) and the animators at Bones Studio B (Mob Psycho 100) give Vigilante an art style that is distinct from the flagship series – even compared to other series adapted from manga, this one has distinctly comic-book-y aesthetic. The character outlines are thick, the shading is striking, and the colors pop. Every frame is vibrant; like the Spider-Verse movies, sounds effects are rendered as onscreen onomatopoeia. (“Bam!” “Pow!,” etc.). The first episode doesn't reach the level of epic action of My Hero Academia, but these touches make even small alley brawls feel unique and dynamic.\nVigilantes is its own, smaller-scale story completely unconcerned with top heroes and U.A. High School. But some familiar faces show up nonetheless. Fortunately, these cameos and guest appearances (in the premiere, at least) aren’t shoehorned in as reminders of Vigilantes’ roots. Instead, they’re just another example of the fully realized, lived-in world in which these episodes take place in.\nMy Hero Academia: Vigilantes is a worthy spin-off of the popular superhero anime. Its small scale story and focus on street-level heroism expands the show's world in interesting ways, while introducing a relatable, everyman hero. The anime boasts a dazzling art direction that translate the vibrant colors and lively onomatopoeia of a classic superhero comic to the TV screen."

    "title": "That Robot Giggling in the Superman Sneak Peek Is the Secret to James Gunn's Success",
    "publishedAt": "2025-04-04T01:17:53Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/that-robot-giggling-superman-sneak-peek-trailer-secret-james-gunn-success",
    "full_text": "With the wide release of the five-minuteSuperman sneak peekthat was first shown at CinemaCon earlier this week, one thing stands out even more than Krypto’s lovable (if painful for Superman) hijinks: It’s the fact that James Gunn understands the most important thing he can do for his reboot of not just the Man of Steel, but the entire DC universe, is to make us care about the characters. All of the characters, great and small, Kryptonian and human, canine and, yes, even robot.Gigglingrobots.\n\nThe extended preview features footage from the film that we’ve seen before, including of course Kal-El’s incredibly cute super dog arriving on the icy scene when his master is at a real low point. But it expands on that sequence fromthe film’s first trailer, showing us that Krypto is very much the troublemaker Gunn has described him to be. Yes, Superman is bloodied and beaten, pleading with Krypto to take him “home,” but all the pup wants to do is play. And he makes this point by jumping on the hurt Supes with all of his super-dog strength, and even dragging Kal-El’s leg up into an extremely awkward yet entirely believable pose. “Play with me, Dad!” he’s saying, in deeds if not words. It’s all very funny and it makes you love Krypto even more than you already did. Oh yes, you will believe that a super-powered dog can fly – and be lovable.\nBut Supermanishurt, and Krypto finally gets it, bringing Kal to the Fortress of Solitude. And that’s where we meet that giggling robot, who is one of the keys to understanding why James Gunn is so good at what he does. But before we get to that, consider that the first time we ever saw Gunn’s version of the Last Son of Krypton in action, he was in bad shape – beaten up, bleeding, needing hisdogto save him. And we don’t yet know who dished out this punishment either, so this first image of Gunn’s version of Superman battered and broken is not for the benefit of getting a villain over. There’s no “look how scary this antagonist is because they beat the hell out of the Man of Steel.” The purpose of beginning the entire marketing push for this film is to show Superman in dire straits and in need of help. It’s a far cry from the typical introduction of any superhero, let alonethesuperhero, and yet it makes perfect sense coming from Gunn.\nIt’s the Harrison Ford Syndrome. Which isn’t so much a syndrome as it is a legitimate strength of Ford’s on screen persona. Either way, think about how badly Indiana Jones gets roughed up. We don’t love him because he’s so good at fighting; it’s because he’s tired and in pain just like the rest of us. Think about the scared-as-shit look on Ford’s face when he was on the run in The Fugitive, the desperate man leaping off of a dam en route to prove his innocence. Think about the hurt on Han Solo’s face, the fully bruised ego when he thought Leia was into Luke and not him at the start of Empire. It’s an everyman appeal that few actors have ever really been able to pull off. Honestly, it might just be Ford and Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley that do it completely right. The point is, seeing your heroes beat up a little bit kind of makes you love them even more, especially when they rise to the occasion later to be, you know,heroes, despite everything they’ve been through.\nGunn knows this, and he has a track record of putting his characters through the ringer. Think back to the first time we met the Guardians of the Galaxy. The first trailer for that film shows that nobody knows Star-Lord’s name and that it stings a little. And yes, Star-Lord was a little known character from the depths of Marvel’s roster, and Superman is… well, it’s almost apples to oranges, but Gunn’s approach is exactly the same here. Let’s put some dents in our main character as quickly as we can. Let’s meet a protagonist at a moment when they’renotheroic, not saving the day, when they don’t even have the upper hand – that’s part of what makes Gunn’s superhero work resonate as well as anybody’s ever been able to.\nSo giving us a Superman who right off the bat has broken ribs, a jacked-up bladder, and is in awful pain even when/because his robots are healing him… it’s a very Gunn choice, and it goes a long way to getting us invested in his version of a character who, let’s not forget, has had like 10 movies and 15 TV shows or something at this point and is older than your grandparents. Superman and all his pals have been around forever, so why should we care about yet another version of his story?\nAnd not for nothing, it’s important to remember that a significant criticism has been lobbed at Superman over the years saying his invulnerability and squeaky clean boy scout-ness are just plain boring. He was, after all, created to be the best of us, but crafting interesting narratives around an overpowered alien with only a single weakness can start to get hard after a century. So howdoyou make this familiar story engaging? Opening on a shot of a damaged Kal-El is a great start, but we still need to fall for the supporting cast.\nAnd that brings us back to the giggling robot. Once Krypto gets his dad into the Fortress (which is a cool re-thinking of the classic Richard Donner ice-crystal Fortress of Solitude, only in this case one that grows out of the snowy landscape on command), the robots take custody of Superman as they carry the injured hero in to treat his wounds. In the comics we know that the ‘bot known asKelex is usually the main caretaker of the Fortress, although here we see the main robot has the simple designation of “4” on the Superman-shield on his chest.\nAs they tend to Superman, 4 (voiced by Alan Tudyk) introduces the newest robot of the group: “Meet 12. She’s new.” Superman nods to her weakly, and 12 practically blushes, despite being made of metal, as she giggles and says “Oh, he looked at me!”\n12 has just that one line of dialogue (we're not sure who’s voicing the character but it’s gotta be someone we know, right?), but we're already so invested in her and these other robots that we're a little embarrassed to admit it. 4 also tells Kal-El that there’s no need to thank them for their service because they have “no consciousness whatsoever. Merely automatons here to serve.” But you know what? We're calling bullshit on that right now, because you can be guaranteed that half of us are going to be crying when we see the movie and one of these robots gets killed (something that in fact has already been teased in the first trailer). There’s also something about Tudyk’s delivery of those lines, like he’s dripping with sarcasm. No consciousness my red-briefs-clad-butt.\nSo even while comics fans can dig in and try to figure out if 4 is Kelex or how Superman’s biology works (he has intestines!) or whatever other lore or Easter egg stuff comes to mind, Gunn isn’t actually that concerned with that stuff. At minimum, we feel comfortable saying it doesn’t seem like his first priority. Yes, he understands the geeky things, he’s a fan himself and he’s read the comics – and loves them, no doubt – but what he’s doing here is building out little character moments and beats that will make us actually care about these people. And robots. And dogs!\nThis isn’t gonna be aSuperman movieas much as it is a James Gunn movie, and we can’t wait."

    "title": "Invincible Season 3 Ending Explained: How Does It Set Up Season 4?",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-13T17:23:30Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-season-3-ending-explained-how-does-it-set-up-season-4",
    "full_text": "This article contains spoilers for theInvincibleSeason 3 finale.\n\nAfter eight episodes featuringhugecharacter deaths, multiple Invincibles (Steven Yeun), and so, so much blood and guts, Invincible Season 3 is in the books. Unlike Season 2, which ended with a relatively quieter tag for the finale, Season 3 not only teed up atonof storylines for the already-in-production Season 4… It also included a mid-credits scene that sets up a storyline Invincible co-creator Robert Kirkman never got to do in the comic books.\nBefore we get to that closing montage – and mid-credits scene – a bit of explanation about the finale itself. It’s for the most part one, long fight scene as Invincible, Oliver (Christian Convery) and Atom Eve (Gillian Jacobs) take on the vicious Viltrumite warrior Conquest (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Conquest is ostensibly on Earth to prepare the world for Viltrumite, er, conquest, but as he explains repeatedly to Invincible, he really loves destroying and torturing things.\nAfter Conquest seemingly kills Eve, Invincible, who has had both hands broken, absolutely loses it and bashes Conquest to “death” with his own head. Some might say this is sweet, sweet vengeance for Negan (also Morgan) famously bashing Glenn Rhee’s (also Yeun) head in on The Walking Dead, but it comes straight from the Invincible comics, which came out in 2009. So incredibly satisfying to watch if you want #Justice4Glenn, but also mostly just a nice coincidence.\nIn any case, Eve isnotdead and reveals – as fans who watched the Atom Eve Special learned – that when she’s put in moments of extreme stress, she’s able to get past the mental blocks that otherwise stop her from transmuting living matter, instead of just inert materials. However, eagle-eyed fans will also note that when she transmutes Invincible’s costume later in the scene when they’re about to have sex, it’s made of plants… So she may have broken through these blocks in a bigger way than she realizes.\nThe final conclusion of the episode, and the arc of the season, is that Invincible visits his half-brother Oliver in a hospital bed. And while Oliver thinks Invincible is going to tell him that killing is wrong… Invincible has decided that if anyone threatens his family again, just as Angstrom Levy (Sterling K. Brown) did in the previous episode, and Conquest this week, he won’t hesitate to kill them.\nIt’s a surprising move from the show, though again one pulled directly from the comic books, almost word for word. While the large majority of superhero media, from TV shows to movies, to the original comics wrestle with the “should heroes kill?” debate, Invincible has firmly fallen on the side of “yeah, when necessary.” Still, an ominous musical sting played under Invincible’s pro-death penalty statement points to more challenges coming the way of his realigned moral compass. So expect that this debate might not be as open and shut as the finale indicates.\nBeyond that, the real eyebrow-raising moments are saved for that montage. So let’s break those Season 4 teases down, one by one.\nLast seen in Season 2, Episode 6 “It’s Not That Simple,” the Sequids are incredibly dangerous Martian brain slugs who almost beat the Guardians of the Globe in their last encounter, including Invincible and Atom Eve. They had taken over the brain of an astronaut named Rus Livingston (Ben Schwartz), who was finally freed and brought back to Earth after a horrifying, harrowing ordeal. Unfortunately for Rus, after he returned to his apartment, which had been trashed by Shapesmith (also Schwartz), he threw up a Sequid in the sink – which immediately took over his body, again.\nThat plotline has been on hold since the aforementioned episode, but looks like it’s coming back in a big way in Season 4. While everything else has been going on this season, the Sequids have been steadily building an army in the sewers, including what looks like hundreds of human workers and others. Given we were told that if the Sequids ever made it to Earth it was game over for humanity… Yeah, that’s bad! “Not long now,” says Russequid. Uh-oh!\nAt the end of Season 3, Episode 4, “You Were My Hero,” the unstoppable Battle Beast was fighting a Viltrumite in the cold, dark reaches of space. We catch up to him here, as well as the scattered remains of the Viltrumite… BB is in suspended animation but is quickly picked up by an alien ship. And a few seconds after that, he wakes up, ready for battle. He wants “more!”\nIf things pan out on the TV show the same way they do in the comic, the ship was part of the Coalition of Planets, the group fighting back against the Viltrumites. Alongside Allen the Alien (Seth Rogen) and Nolan Grayson (J.K. Simmons), it looks like the Coalition finally has a fighting chance against the unstoppable aliens.\nIn one of the best casting coups on the show, the creepy, Cenobite-esque Technicians who fixed up Angstrom Levy, as first seen in Season 3, Episode 7, are voiced by Doug Bradley. You might know him better as Pinhead from the Hellraiser series. And in this teaser of coming attractions, we get to hear Bradley say somethingextremelyPinhead.\nAfter revealing that Angstrom has a new arm thanks to them (Invincible accidentally amputated it last episode), Angstrom asks what they want in return. “Angstrom Levy, you have witnessed what our ambitions have done to our world, and what we have had to do to ourselves to survive here,” a Technician explains.\nAngstrom thinks they want a new home, but the Technicians have other ideas. “That is only the beginning of the delights we will achieve together,” the Technician says. Now, the classic Hellraiser line is “We have such sights to show you” while the 2022 remake employed “greater delights await.” But come on, if you weren’t Leo Dicaprio pointing at the screen meme at that line, what are we even doing here?\nIn any case, to explain what the Technicians are up to is to spoil one of the great plot twists of the Invincible comics. Suffice it to say that they will tie into the action, and we have not seen the last of either Angstrom or the not-Cenobites.\nDespite Invincible demanding Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins) show him Conquest’s dead body, it turns out that the dead body was a fake. In fact, Cecil has Conquest locked in a massive, underground chamber as the Viltrumite’s body reconstitutes itself.\nDonald (Chris Diamantopoulos), Cecil’s right-hand man, protests that this is a mistake. And if you’ve read the comics, you know that Donald is correct: you cannot hold a massively powered Viltrumite like Conquest with mere Earth materials, no matter how secure Cecil makes the facility. Unfortunately for Cecil, as well as the world, in this case, Invincible was correct: Conquest should have been killed.\nThat brings us to the mid-credits scene. While everything else we’ve explained above happens in the comic books by Kirkman, Ryan Ottley, and Cory Walker, this scene is completely new. And in fact, it’s something Kirkman always wanted to do in the comics, but never found room for. Oh, and there’s a fantastic, surprise voice actor involved.\nRight after the end credits begin, we cut to Damien Darkblood (Clancy Brown), the demon detective we haven’t seen since Season 1, Episode 4, “Neil Armstrong, Eat Your Heart Out.” In case you forgot – it aired back in 2021, after all – Damien was investigating Omni-Man, then set up by Cecil and sent back to Hell. As he was sucked down to the inferno, he threatened vengeance on Cecil… And that’s (potentially) what we’re seeing here.\nNow missing his trenchcoat, Damien creates a summoning circle, which calls a demon lord voiced by none other than Bruce Campbell. And Damien hails to the king, baby, by bringing “the great beast… welcome news.” Damien explains that he has the means to restore the demon to his former glory, and the “infernal throne.” The key? A “surface dweller of great power, likes of which this planet has not seen for eons.” And furthermore, Damien explains that “his blackened heart will be bound to your service.” And how will they do that? By conjuring “him” to Hell.\nIn the comics, Damien Darkblood was even more of a blink-and-you-miss-him character than he was on the TV show. But as Kirkman explained to theCartoonist Kayfabe podcastin 2020, there was originally more planned.\n“The thing that I really regret is I never had an adventure where the superheroes went into Hell,” Kirkman explained. “There’s been so many superhero comics where it’s like, they got to go fight Mephisto or something, and I was like, ah jeez, I never got around to that. And the Damien Darkblood character was there so I could eventually do a story like that, and I never got around to it.”\nPart of the reason for this may be that the initial storyline and reveal of Omni-Man as a bad guy was supposed to go nearly double the length that it did in the comic. It ultimately came to a head in issues 12 and 13, versus the planned 25. That meant there just wasn’t as much room for Darkblood to be investigating Omni-Man, because… Well, there was nothing left to investigate. So credit to Kirkman and company for letting that planned story play out on the TV show in a way we never saw in the books.\nThe big question here is: who is Damien Darkblood referring to? Is it Invincible? Omni-Man? Cecil? We’ll know more when Season 4 of Invincible premieres on Prime Video."

    "full_text": "Tron fans have reason to be excited in 2025. Following a long dormant period, the franchise is racing its way back into theaters this October with a new sequel called Tron: Ares. The third Tron movie stars Jared Leto as the titular character, a program who ventures into the real world on a high-stakes yet very mysterious mission.\n\nBut is it safe to call Ares a sequel? Visually, this new movie is clearly cut from the same cloth as 2010’s Tron: Legacy.The newly released trailermakes that much apparent. And with Nine Inch Nails stepping in for Daft Punk, it’s obvious the electronica-heavy score remains as big a priority as ever.\nBut in other ways, Ares is looking less like a direct sequel and more like a soft reboot of the franchise. Where are all the surviving characters from Legacy? Why aren’t stars Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde returning for Ares? Why is Jeff Bridges of all people the one Tron veteran confirmed for the cast of Ares? Let’s take a deeper look at how Legacy set itself up for a sequel, and why Ares seems to be ignoring that setup.\nTron: Legacy mainly revolves around the shared struggle of Garrett Hedlund’s Sam Flynn and Olivia Wilde’s Quorra. Sam is the son of Bridges’ character, Kevin Flynn, the CEO of telecom giant Encom who disappeared in 1989. In Legacy, Sam ventures into the digital landscape known as The Grid to find his father and prevent Kevin’s creation CLU from leading a digital army into the real world.\nAs Sam reunites with his father, he also meets Quorra. Quorra is a member of a race known as ISOs, digital lifeforms who appeared spontaneously in The Grid. Quorra is proof that life finds a way, even inside a computer simulation. In the end, Sam defeats CLU and returns to the real world with Quorra in tow. The world’s first digital lifeform has been transformed into flesh and blood.\nLegacy’s ending lays a pretty clear path for a sequel. Sam himself is finally ready to embrace his responsibility as Encom’s largest shareholder. Rather than simply play annual pranks on the Encom board, Sam is prepared to lead the company into a brighter and more open-source future. Quorra is by his side, serving as living proof of the true wonders that await in the digital realm.\nLegacy sets up an ongoing storyline for both Sam and Quorra. In fact, the home video release even includes a short film called “Tron: The Next Day,” showing Sam returning to Encom to begin shepherding the company into a new era.\nBut despite that, neither Hedlund nor Wilde seem to be returning for Tron: Ares. They’re both very conspicuous by their absence in the sequel. On some level, it’s not surprising that Disney would want to pivot to a different, more standalone direction for Ares.Legacy grossed $409.9 million worldwideon a budget of $170 million (not including marketing costs). If not an outright failure, it wasn’t quite the smash hit Disney was hoping for. Like 2012’s John Carter and 2013’s Lone Ranger, Legacy is one of a number of underperforming live-action movies from an era before Disney really started to lean on Marvel and Star Wars. The studio may have decided that Legacy didn’t strike enough of a chord with moviegoers that directly continuing the plot made much sense.\nStill, as we’ve explored, Sam and Quorra are too central to the narrative of Tron to just completely ignore. Are we meant to assume Sam gave up on his mission to build a better Encom? Did Quorra grow tired of the real world and return to The Grid? The absence of these characters leaves a major void in the franchise, and we hope Ares finds some way of at least acknowledging Sam and Quorra’s importance, if not bringing them back in unannounced cameo roles.\nHedlund and Wilde aren’t the only Legacy actors whose absence in the Ares cast is baffling. There’s also Cillian Murphy, whose character was clearly being set up for much bigger things in a third Tron movie.\nMurphy very briefly appears in an uncredited role in Legacy, playing Edward Dillinger, Jr., the son of David Warner’s Edward Dillinger from the original Tron. The younger Dillinger is introduced as the head of Encom’s software development team, and a fierce opponent of Sam’s commitment to free, open-source software.\nIt goes without saying that Murphy wasn’t cast just to appear in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo role. Dillinger was obviously intended to play a bigger part in a future sequel, where he likely would have become the main human antagonist, just as his father was in Tron. Dillinger’s role likely would have coincided with the return of the Master Control Program, the sinister entity that served as the main digital villain of the first movie.\nJudging from the Tron: Ares trailer, the MCP itself may be back in play. Ares and his fellow programs are marked by glowing red highlights, which is the calling card of the MCP, just as CLU’s faction was orange and Tron was blue. That suggests a sinister undertone to Ares’ mission. We don’t know if he’s meant to be hero or villain. He doesn’t seem to understand much about his mission either. But if the MCP is back, why hasn’t Edward Dillinger returned, too? Why is Gillian Anderson’s new character suddenly the focus of the Encom board?\nThat said, we do know that Evan Peters is playing a character named Julian Dillinger, so at least it appears that the Dillinger clan has a part to play in this story. And it’s always possible that Murphy (who, again, wasn’t actually credited in Legacy) is still secretly returning for the new film.\nArguably the most baffling omission of all from the Tron: Ares cast is Bruce Boxleitner. If this is a Tron movie, where is Tron himself? In the original movie, Boxleitner played both Encom executive Alan Bradley and the heroic security program Tron. Boxleitner reprised the Alan role in Tron: Legacy, while it was eventually revealed that CLU’s bodyguard Rinzler was a reprogrammed Tron. When last we saw Rinzler in Legacy, he had fallen into the Sea of Simulation, which wiped away his new programming and restored the hero within.\nSadly, it doesn’t appear that Boxleitner is returning for Ares for either role. We can deal with Alan being written out of the picture, but is the plan really to make a Tron movie without its namesake? Or is it possible that Tron has been recast with a younger actor? Perhaps that’s who Cameron Monaghan is playing?\nWhatever is going on here, we would hope that Ares intends to follow up on Tron’s open-ended fate from Legacy. This character deserves redemption after what he was subjected to by CLU. And a Tron sequel needs to include Tron in some capacity.\nPerhaps the single most baffling announcement regarding Tron: Ares is the news that Bridges is returning to the franchise. Sure, he’s the most recognizable and bankable star among the Tron: Legacy cast, but there’s the little problem that both of his characters were killed off in that sequel. In the climax of Tron: Legacy, Kevin Flynn sacrifices himself to destroy CLU and give his son and adopted daughter the chance to escape back to the real world.\nSo why is Bridges of all people back for a third movie? It’s hard to say. We can briefly hear Bridges’ voice in the trailer, but there’s no indication of whether he might be playing a still-living Kevin Flynn or a version of CLU. Did Flynn’s digital archenemy somehow survive their shared death in Legacy? Did Flynn keep a backup of CLU handy? Or has Flynn himself somehow transcended the limits of flesh, achieving immortality in The Grid?\nThat’s a mystery that will no doubt be solved in Ares. We’ll also find out whether Ares himself is working with Flynn/CLU or carrying out the Master Control Program’s agenda. But whatever the film reveals, there’s no getting around the fact that it’s pretty weird to have a Tron sequel that resurrects Bridges’ character(s) but ignores all the important players who actually survived the events of Legacy. As much as we’re looking forward to Tron: Ares, the sequel also leaves us more than a little perplexed.\nBut, hey, at least that NIN score is sounding pretty swell.\nIn other Tron news, find out about the series return to the gaming realm withthe Metroid/Hades hybrid Tron: Catalyst.\nJesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

    "full_text": "The Accountant opens in theaters on Friday, April 25. This review is based on a screening at the 2025 SXSW Film and TV Festival.\n\nYou can tell from the way the title is stylized on screen – as a mathematical exponent, likeAlien³– that The Accountant 2 has removed the self-seriousness from its predecessor’s otherwise delightful formula. Gavin O’Connor’s sequel is a blast, building on the story and relationships of 2016’sThe Accountantto reveal a touching, hilarious portrait of fraught brotherhood within a charged and politically relevant plot. All the while, it leans full-tilt into a goofy setup that’s executed with utter confidence: Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck), a.k.a. The Accountant, is a savant number-cruncher for the mob and part-time vigilante gunman whose autism is gently approached and realistically performed, but framed as though it were a superpower.\nThere’s less bean counting in The Accountant 2, but far more blood and bullets, starting with an opening scene in which former Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (or FinCEN) director Raymond King (J.K. Simmons) is gunned down while working a case in secret. Once the Commissioner Gordon to The Accountant’s Batman – fitting, as Affleck and Simmons have since played that dynamicin the DC Extended Universe– King has only been following leads in which he’s emotionally invested. His death leaves behind an intricate puzzle for Wolff to solve, alongside King’s Treasury Department successor, the returning Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson). The case that got King killed opens up a web of human trafficking between Central America and the southern U.S., exposing the ways in which undocumented immigrants who have little legal recourse are brutally exploited. Where the first film was mostly unsentimental about its central plot (which revolved around a robotics firm), The Accountant 2 conjures immense sympathy with its topical melodrama and the mystery of King’s death.\nBut as somber as this story seems at first blush, it’s also peppered with wildly amusing moments of character. That begins with Wolff’s re-introduction, during which he games a speed-dating algorithm by sprucing up his profile in all the right ways, only to botch every face-to-face encounter. It’s the perfect kind of silly, placing Wolff’s isolation front and center while setting up his impending reunion with his estranged brother, fellow contract killer Braxton (Jon Bernthal), whose help he seeks to solve King’s murder. Also assisting Wolff is his returning, remote, technologically savvy assistant Justine (Allison Robertson, replacing Allison Wright from the first film), a nonverbal resident of a mansion-like academy for young autistic students. She has her own legion of hackers-in-training this time, à la Professor X – who she even quotes at one point. Like I said: perfectly silly, even if the portrayal of neurodivergence constantly threatens to tip (but never fully does) into offensiveness.\nA mysterious, scarily capable assassin known only as Anaïs (Daniella Pineda) seems to somehow be involved in King’s case, but The Accountant 2’s lopsided structure ensures that she disappears for lengthy periods. However, the layers it reveals to her seemingly single-minded character do retroactively justify those absences. After all, this is the kind of movie where no matter how many conveniences cause its jigsaw pieces to click into place, the result is no less entertaining.\nJust like The Accountant, whose heightened tone and reliance on tried-and-true storytelling devices – enormous coincidences, long-lost family connections –  wouldn’t feel out of place in a Bollywood movie,the sequel similarly runs a crowd-pleasing gamut. The action is capable and clear. The plot, while complicated in structure, takes the characters to interesting places (both geographically and emotionally). The comedy is fine-tuned and, most importantly, entirely character-and-performance based.\nWhat we said about The Accountant\nThe Accountant is most engrossing when it focuses on being a character study of this very distinct protagonist. It’s the ultimate actor’s challenge to convey a lot with doing very little and Affleck’s nuanced, tightly coiled performance proves he was up for the task. He also finds the humor in his character and, less surprisingly, excels in the brutal combat scenes. –Jim Vejvoda\nScore: 7.3\nRead the complete The Accountant Review.\nThings simmer on a medium flame until Bernthal shows up and instantly sets the screen ablaze. An actor long compared to Robert De Niro, he finally gets his own “You talkin’ to me?” moment in The Accountant 2, which paves the path for Braxton’s surprising vulnerability – he’s a lost, lonely soul who just wants his older brother’s friendship. Affleck, despite a voice that seems more influenced byThe Simpsons’ Comic Book Guythis time around, returns seamlessly to the role of Wolff. Having retreated almost entirely to the solitude of his tricked-out Airstream trailer, he seems to want to connect as well, but his misreadings of his brother’s body language and intentions make this difficult. Braxton is frank and playful, and Bernthal imbues the character’s body language with an easy-going fluidity, which makes for an enchantingly funny contrast with Wolff’s unwavering stiffness.\nThe clashes between the brothers are the movie’s heart and soul – this especially comes to light during their downtime from vigilantism (and from Medina’s disapproval of their methods). One scene in an LA square dancing bar is a particular delight, between Braxton’s eagerness to throw hands, and Wolff’s wonderfully roundabout methods of flirtation, which involves him calculating his way onto the dance floor. It’s a sequence that demonstrates O’Connor understanding that movement and character are intrinsically bound, and in action cinema, you can’t really have one without building up the other.\nThe Accountant 2  is a surprisingly sentimental sequel, which keeps even the most scattered elements of its plot firmly glued together. It’s filled with the kind of unapologetic cheese that Hollywood action has long since replaced with irreverent, quippy snark, ensuring that its humor and drama go hand-in-hand at every turn, resulting in one of the year’s most well-rounded studio pictures.\nAn immensely entertaining sequel, The Accountant 2 brings back both Ben Affleck’s autistic assassin and his frank, playful, neurotypical brother (played by Jon Bernthal) for a surprising buddy comedy steeped in equally unexpected sentiment. The film is both fun and politically charged, with the sibling duo bickering while pulling on the threads of a murder that reveal a web of human trafficking and cruelty to undocumented immigrants. It’s a bit of everything all at once, and it works like a charm."

    "full_text": "Amazon quietly restocked a bunch ofPokémon TCG bundles just days agoand stock is already running low. These Scarlet & Violet sets have been MIA for weeks, and now they’re back at retail prices. I already added a couple to my cart,Surging SparksBooster Bundle,Shrouded FableETB and Paldean Fates Booster Bundle. Trainers need to snap these up quick. If they’re gone by the time you get there, that’s on you.\n\nLooking for the least expensive PlayStation 5 console you can your hands on? As part of its US Anniversary Sale, AliExpress is offering an importedSony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Editiongaming console for $367.94 shipped after $80 off coupon code \"MAYUE008\". This is a brand new and retail boxed product that is stocked in a US warehouse and qualifies for local delivery, which means it ships free and arrives within about 1-2 weeks.\nI also spotted a couple of power banks on sale from INIU and Anker. If you’ve ever watched your phone die mid-flight or mid-text, you know why I’m excited. These things are cheap, fast, and less annoying than asking strangers for a charger at an airport. Do with that information what you will. Oh, and while we’re on the topic of things I absolutely don’t need but definitely want: theGamera: Attack of Legionaction figure is up for preorder at the IGN Store for a cool $560, and Humble Bundle just dropped a massiveDragonlance book bundlethat practically dares you to add 25+ fantasy novels to your backlog for the price of lunch.\nI want this bundle purely for the thrill of cracking six packs in a row and pretending I’m building a deck for Worlds. The Surging Sparks expansion is still new enough to feel fresh, and at $45.02, it’s a decent value compared to scalper prices that make you question your financial decisions. If you just want to dip into the latest set without going full collector mode, this is it.\nShiny Pokémon are back, and apparently so is my addiction to them. The Paldean Fates bundle gives you six chances to pull something sparkly, and while $69.94 isn’t exactly pocket change, I think the potential dopamine hit is worth the gamble. It’s in stock, it ships fast, and I’ve made worse choices at 2 a.m. on eBay.\nI’m not saying this is the nerdiest thing you can buy today, but it’s definitely on the leaderboard. Humble Bundle just dropped a massive Dragonlance collection; 25+ books for about the cost of lunch. If you’ve ever wanted to get lost in magical twin drama, cursed artifacts, or the politics of dwarves (because who hasn’t), this is your sign. Plus, part of your purchase supports Room to Read, so now your TBR pile can come with good karma.\nIn my opinion, this is the one to grab if you're all-in on the set. Nine booster packs, a Pecharunt promo, themed sleeves, dice, and an actually-useful storage box? For $54.96? I’ve spent more on less at Taco Bell. Plus, it's still Prime eligible, which means you don’t have to sell your soul for free shipping. Win-win.\nThis is what happens when you give kaiju collectors exactly what they want: a 9.5-inch figure of LEGION fromGamera 2, complete with flying parts, glowing bits, and articulation that would make Spider-Man jealous. Sure, it’s $560, but I’ve seen statues half as cool go for double that. If you’re the kind of person who rearranges shelf space for something before buying it, I totally get it.\nThis thing charges your phone like it’s got something to prove. At $26.98, it gives you a full week’s worth of backup power and a built-in flashlight just in case you drop your phone and your dignity under your car seat. I want it purely because it has an LED readout that makes me feel like I’m operating a mission control panel instead of just charging my AirPods.\nI think this is the best deal of the day, and not just because it’s $17.99. It’s slim, light, and can survive a drop better than my will to stay off social media. Anker knows what it’s doing, and this charger just works. No random overheating, no mystery ports, just plug it in and keep scrolling through whatever app is currently ruining your sleep schedule.\nHulu + Live TVoffers a three-day free trialthat allows you to take the live TV streaming service for a spin. This is one of the overallbest streaming free trialsbecause it gets you a bundle of services. It is quite a bit shorter than the standard Hulu free trial of 30 days, but it's a great way to test it out over the weekend.\nWith a 240Hz refresh rate, Dual QHD resolution, and 0.03ms response time, this 49-inch ultrawide OLED is built for high-performance PC gaming. The 1800R curve and HDR True Black 400 make it incredibly immersive, while FreeSync Premium Pro helps keep gameplay smooth and responsive.\nThis Android tablet comes with an S Pen included, a 10.4-inch display, and Samsung DeX for multitasking. At under $200, it’s a solid pick for casual gamers, students, or anyone who wants a lightweight, entertainment-ready tablet with productivity perks.\nCelebrate Women's History Month with a killer bundle featuring female-led games. Titles include Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, Control: Ultimate Edition,Darksiders III,Beyond: Two Souls, and more. It’s a $160+ value for just $12, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity.\nWith a whopping 10,000Pa of suction, self-refilling, self-emptying, sonic mopping, and even hot-air mop drying, the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra takes hands-off cleaning to the next level. It's packed with AI features and even supports pet tracking and video calls.\nAmazon’s newest Kindleadds color to the mix with a 7\" Colorsoft display. It still lasts up to 8 weeks on a single charge and now supports wireless charging and full-color highlights. It's ideal for reading graphic novels, cookbooks, or anything where visuals matter.\nEnjoy spatial audio, active noise canceling, and up to 40 hours of battery life. These over-ear headphones are compatible with both iOS and Android, and support lossless audio over USB-C. A strong option for commuters, creators, and music lovers.\nThis Lenovo Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop drops to $2,513 at AliExpress after $100 off coupon code \"IFPRZAZ\" is applied. The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's top-of-the-line gaming laptop and we rarely see discounts for this model. This particular configuration features a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU and RTX 4080 GPU for comfortable high-fps gaming on the 16\" display's native 2560x1600 resolution.\n$32.99 for this masterpiece? I genuinely laughed. I paid full price, and I don’t even get the exclusive Cloud and Sephiroth controller skin. If you’ve ever wanted to explore Midgar’s post-industrial wastelands with emotionally repressed sword boys with a price lower than Black Friday's, here you go.\nI think these might actually cancel the noise in my soul. The sound is incredible, the fit is dreamy, and the battery life is better than my phone’s. Honestly, $249.99 for peace and quiet? Cheaper than therapy.\nIf you’ve ever looked at your shelf of figures, sneakers, or LEGO builds and thought, “This could be more dramatic,” I highly recommend these cases. I want my collectibles to feel as important as they think they are.\nAt $38, these are the definition of “just throw them in the cart.” I use them for work, walks, and pretending I’m on a call to avoid conversations. Plus, 50 hours of battery life? That’s just showing off.\n$59.99 to cry over Disney characters and complicated lore? Yes, please. I think this collection should come with a warning and a box of tissues. It’s that much of a journey.\nThis speaker is tiny, but it’s loud enough to offend your upstairs neighbors and cute enough that they won’t stay mad. It survived my shower playlist and a weekend camping trip without flinching.\nCrisp comms, no lag, and a mic that doesn’t make me sound like a robot underwater. I want to pretend I’m a competitive esports player, and this headset lets me live the fantasy.\nThis speaker is basically the action hero of the portable audio world. It’s waterproof, rustproof, and probably judge-proof. I tossed it in my bag, it bounced around all day, and still blasted bass like nothing happened.\nBass so strong it could cause an existential crisis. These are like strapping a subwoofer to your ears, but in a comfy, eco-friendly kind of way. I think I saw my dog flinch the first time I hit the ULT button.\nXM4s are the previous-gen MVPs. They’ve still got top-tier ANC and that dreamy comfort that makes you forget you're wearing them. At $179.99, I’m thinking of buying a backup pair for future me.\nA wearable speaker sounds ridiculous... until you try it. I felt like a sci-fi character watching a movie with surround sound on my shoulders. Honestly, I want to wear this to Zoom calls just for the audio flex.\nMy living room sounds like a private screening room now. I think this soundbar made my couch comfier just by association. Movies, games and music are all better with this beast.\nI didn’t need a party speaker, but I bought this anyway. Complete with lights, bass and karaoke ports, it’s basically a party in a box. I want to say I got it for the sound, but really, it’s the lights.\nThis TV made me realize I’ve been watching in peasant resolution my whole life. Mini LED, PlayStation 5 optimization, and colors so vivid I nearly apologized to my last TV for talking trash about it.\nI want to live in this TV. It’s 85 inches of 4K glory, and somehow still cheaper than a vacation. Probably because you won’t need one after this, seeing as your living room becomes the destination.\nThis one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.\nIGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.

The limited-time sale price of $52.49, down from $74.99, makes this an easy win for any RPG fan.\nIf you’ve ever dreamed of wielding the Master Sword, this Tamashii Nations replica brings that dream to life. At 41.3 inches, it’s a full-sized, collector-worthy version of Link’s legendary blade. It’s not just for display either thanks to authentic sound effects and vibrations activate when you grip and swing it, making you feel like the true Hero of Hyrule.\nThe hilt features three buttons that play eight iconic songs from Zelda’s history, including themes from Ocarina of Time, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom. The sword comes with a sheath and display stand, so whether you want to show it off or take it into battle (against your furniture), it’s ready. At $200, this highly allocated collectible is bound to sell out fast.\nA genuine Apple leather case for $11.99? That’s not a typo. It’s an 80% discount. Made from specially tanned leather, this MagSafe-compatible case snaps right onto your iPhone 14 Plus and develops a unique patina over time. It’s slim, stylish, and still protects your phone from scratches and drops. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your case, now’s the time before Apple realizes what they’ve done.\nIf you’re tired of playing hide-and-seek with your keys, wallet, or luggage, an AirTag is your new best friend. It instantly connects to your iPhone or iPad, letting you track items in the Find My app. Lost something nearby? Precision Finding (on select iPhones) guides you straight to it. Lost something far away? The Find My network (powered by millions of Apple devices) has your back. At $24, this is one of those tiny Apple accessories that’s actually worth every penny.\nWhy buy one AirTag when you can get four for just $69.99, down from $99? Throw one in your luggage, attach one to your keys, slap one in your backpack, and hand one to a forgetful friend. With Ultra Wideband Precision Finding and the Find My network, losing your stuff is basically impossible. This 4-pack is one of the best deals Apple offers, so grab it while it’s discounted.\nIf you’re serious about drawing, note-taking, or designing, the Apple Pencil Pro is your new creative weapon. It features pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and new intuitive gestures like squeeze and barrel roll to switch tools instantly. Magnetic charging keeps it juiced up, and Find My integration ensures you never lose it. At $99, down from $129, this is the best Apple Pencil yet. If you have a M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air, it’s a must-have.\nStill using an iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (6th Gen)? The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is the one you need. It magnetically attaches and charges, has low latency, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and lets you switch tools with a tap of your finger. Whether you’re sketching, marking up PDFs, or taking notes in class, this $109.99, down from $129 investment will make your iPad feel like an actual notebook.\nThese aren’t just Beats. They’re sporty Beats with active noise cancellation. The secure-fit wingtips keep them locked in place, while Spatial Audio makes movies, music, and games feel immersive. They’ve got 6 hours of battery life (24 with the case), IPX4 sweat resistance, and Apple’s H1 chip for easy iPhone pairing. $169, down from $199.95, is a solid price for fitness-friendly noise-canceling earbuds that won’t budge during workouts.\nThese Beats Studio Buds+ look insanely cool in their Transparent finish and sound just as good. They offer personalized Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and up to 36 hours of battery life. With one-touch pairing for Apple and Android, these are perfect for cross-platform users. They’re currently $129.95, down from $169.95, which is a great price for premium Beats tech.\nLuxury meets practicality in this Modern Buckle band for the Apple Watch. The FineWoven material is soft yet durable, and the hidden magnetic clasp makes securing it a breeze. An inner layer of Vectran weave ensures stretch resistance, so it’ll hold up for years. Normally $149, it’s now $119, making this a rare Apple Watch band deal that’s actually worth jumping on.\nThis isn’t your average watch band. Apple’s Magnetic Link band uses a two-piece magnetic closure that snaps securely into place while staying ultra-comfortable on your wrist. It’s made from FineWoven microtwill, a soft, suede-like material that’s 68% recycled, so you’re doing your wrist and the planet a favor. At $79, down from $99, it’s a great way to give your Apple Watch a fresh new look.\nFor those who prefer their Pokémon sleek and futuristic rather than angry and prehistoric, the Iron Valiant version of the Paradox Rift ETB is it. Same nine booster packs, same pile of energy cards, but this time you get a full-art Iron Bundle promo card (because nothing says \"powerful Pokémon\" like an angry robot penguin).\nI'm so happy to see this in stock. You’ll find nine Paradox Rift booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Scream Tail, and enough card sleeves to make you feel responsible for once. At 4.7 stars with Amazon’s Choice badge, the internet has already decided this is worth it. Will you get a rare pull? There's a chance. Will you have fun? Absolutely.\nIf somehow missed Horizon Zero Dawn over the past eight years (or just want an excuse to replay it in prettier graphics), this PS5 remaster is a steal at 30 bucks. You get faster load times, haptic feedback, and a fresh coat of digital paint to make the post-apocalypse feelextraimmersive. Plus, if you’ve still got your PS4 save, you can pick up right where you left off unless your past self made terrible skill tree choices. Start over and do better.\nYour PS5 (or gaming PC) is begging for more storage, and this SSD let's you install more than Call of Duty. It hits 7,400MB/s speeds, which is absurdly fast. Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this thing speeds up file transfers, content creation, and probably your productivity (so gaming).\nIf you’ve ever looked at your Nintendo Switch storage and thought, \"I really need to delete some games,\" this 1TB microSD card is the answer. With 160MB/s speeds, your game downloads, screenshots, and embarrassing video clips of Mario Kart fails will actually have space to exist. It also comes with an adapter, so you can throw it into a laptop or camera like a real professional.\nLogitech G305 is wireless, fast, and somehow still has a 250-hour battery life, which means you’ll probably forget about batteries it until it inevitably dies at the worst possible moment. It’s lightweight, has six programmable buttons, and runs on one AA battery so when it does die, you won’t be frantically searching for a charging cable.\nSamsung’sQ-Series HW-Q900C/ZA delivers 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos audio that actually lives up to the hype. With Q-Symphony, the soundbar syncs perfectly with Samsung TVs, and SpaceFit Sound Pro customizes audio to your room. The Acoustic Lens Subwoofer ensures deep, punchy bass, while Adaptive Sound and Game Mode Pro make sure everything from dialogue to explosions sounds crisp. At $764 off, this is the cheapest we’ve seen it outside of Black Friday.\nLG B4 OLED TVbrings incredible picture quality at a price that doesn’t require selling a kidney.

    "title": "Top Samsung Products Are In Today's Daily Deals: Odyssey G9, Galaxy Tab S10+, Galaxy S24 and more",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-20T17:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-march-20-2025",
    "full_text": "Samsung came in strong with today’s deals, and I have to admit, I’m eyeing a couple of them up.The 49-inch Odyssey G9 gaming monitorlooks like something pulled straight from a sci-fi movie.The Galaxy Tab S10+ 5Gis basically a laptop in disguise, and theGalaxy Z Flip 6is making flip phones cool again. If that’s not enough, theS24 Ultrais here to remind every other smartphone who’s boss, and theSSD dealsare giving me a solid excuse to finally clean up my storage situation.\n\nSome of these discounts are impressive, like$500 off that insane QD-OLED monitor. Others, like theSonic statueandRimWorld deal, are more like little bonus treats for the fans. Either way, if you’ve been waiting for a solid sale on a gaming monitor, a high-end phone, or a storage upgrade, Samsung has something worth looking at today.\nAliExpress has brand new PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch OLED consoles on sale for prices you won't find anywhere else. These are unopened, retail boxed,genuinegaming console that have been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by youraccount, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. AliExpress offers a return window but the length varies depending on the item.\nI want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.\nThis phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.\nI didn’t know I needed an 11-inch Sonic statue until now. The detail is impressive, the LED lights make it pop, and it’s half off. If you’re a Sonic fan, this is an easy yes. If you’re not, well, now’s a great time to start.\nI can’t think of a reasonnotto buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it. If your PC or laptop is still running on a traditional hard drive, this is your sign to upgrade.\nRimWorld is the kind of game that looks like it’ll be a casual experience, but suddenly, it’s 3 a.m. and you’re emotionally attached to a group of pixelated colonists. The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.\nThis SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferringway too manyphotos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.\nI never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.\nI think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.\nApple’s best earbuds are now $50 off. AirPods Pro 2 feature industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Personalized Spatial Audio for a fully immersive listening experience. A high-fidelity driver and H2 chip deliver richer, crisper sound, while four ear tip sizes ensure the perfect fit. At $199, down from $249, this is a no-brainer deal if you’ve been eyeing Apple’s top-tier wireless earbuds.\nBeats sound at under $60? Now we’re talking. The Beats Solo Buds are lightweight wireless earbuds with up to 18 hours of battery life and a compact case that slips right into your pocket. Custom dual-layer drivers minimize distortion, delivering clear, punchy audio whether you’re blasting workout jams or taking a call. They don’t have ANC, but for $59.95, down from $79.99, these are a steal for casual listeners who want the Beats experience without breaking the bank.\nThe games that defined an era of RPGs are back in this 2D Pixel Remaster bundle, letting you experienceFinal Fantasy I through VIin glorious HD pixel art. The remastered soundtracks, modernized UI, and quality-of-life improvements bring these classics into the modern age while keeping their original charm intact.

    "title": "20 Favorite Female Authors Picked by the Women at IGN",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-22T01:16:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/womens-history-month-ign-staff-picks-favorite-authors",
    "full_text": "As March marksWomen’s History Monthin the US, we wanted to highlight the women here at IGN. Last year, we highlighted some staff picks ofgames, movies, and TV. This year we switched gears to another favorite hobby: reading.\n\nWhen the women of IGN were asked, “Who are your favorite women authors?” – no easy question for avid readers – a fascinating list sprung to life that spanned genres and styles. Let’s see which authors and comic artists were included as we celebrate both the women of IGNandtheir favorite women authors!\nHer stories of love, grief, and understanding the flawed human existence are nothing short of excellent. –Marhyan Franzen\nNotable works: Walk Two Moons, Chasing Redbird\nKelly Sue DeConnick has been battling in the trenches of the “boys club” of comics for years. When she wrote for Marvel, she was the one who brought the title of Captain Marvel to Carol Danvers, a legacy brought over into the MCU years later with her name in the credits as a consultant for the films. Outside of the Big Two, she's been an ever-present voice in indie comics with works like Pretty Deadly (if you're looking for a more mystical western theme) and Bitch Planet (if you want a more sci-fi, dystopian, feminist vibe). She continues with her current project, FML, from Dark Horse Comics for those looking for a more supernatural vibe in our stories. If you haven't read anything she's written yet, you're doing yourself a disservice: DeConnick is an incredible writer and an amazing human. –Chelsea Reed\nNotable works: Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman Historia, Pretty Deadly, Bitch Planet, FML\nSarah Rose Etter writes weird but clear-eyed books for weird people (like me). Though she’s only published two novels thus far, both have been among my favorite books of the year they came out. The Book of X, about a woman born to generational meat farmers and women with their stomach twisted into a knot, was surreal and painfully relatable; Ripe, about a young woman suffering through her job at a recognizably psychotic San Francisco startup and haunted by an ever-present void, swapped that formula (and also ends not unlike Rose Glass’ film Saint Maud). I hope she writes 100 more books like these in my lifetime. –Leanne Butkovic\nNotable works: Ripe, The Book of X\nI am excited to see thefilm adaptationof this feminist medieval tale and to see Charli XCX portray Rosa! –Kelly Pham\nNotable works: The 100 Nights of Hero\nIt's unlikely this is the first time you're being recommended N.K. Jemisin's incredible The Broken Earth Trilogy. Though her other fantasy novels deserve attention in their own right, Jemisin's captivating writing, characters, and creative magic system in The Broken Earth Trilogy (specifically in the second book, The Obelisk Gate) make it the easiest to recommend. Her surprising playfulness with storytelling in The Fifth Season may be confusing for some at first, but stick with it – the payoff is fantastic. It follows Essun, a woman trying to hunt down her husband who murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter while trying to survive a recurring cataclysmic event and hide that she has powers to manipulate the very earth around her. It's an incredible, Hugo Award-winning ride. –Miranda Sanchez\nNotable works: The Broken Earth Trilogy (The Fifth Season), The City We Became\nIt's astounding just how much T. Kingfisher publishes in a year but my adventure-loving heart appreciates the number of Kingfisher's consistently interesting retakes on classic fairy tales and horror stories. Kingfisher's stories tend to skew toward gothic horror and dark fantasy, but even still, her comedic pacing and thoughtfully written characters provide a sometimes needed balance for various novels' heavy themes. Whether it's the slow and creeping exploration of emotional abuse in \"What Moves the Dead\" or her exquisite Saint of Steel fantasy romance series that deals with personal identity and loss, I've come away with a full heart (and feeling a little creeped out). –MS\nNotable works: Nettle & Bone, What Moves the Dead, Paladin's Grace\nMaybe it’s overly obvious to be recommending the most recent Nobel Prize winner for Literature – even members of BTS celebrated her accomplishment on Instagram – but all of the praise lauded on Han Kang is apparent when you crack open one of her novels. Like most people, I was introduced to her work through The Vegetarian when it was translated into English in 2015 and was immediately taken by its disturbingly mesmerizing plot about a housewife who stops eating meat, to the confusion and dismay of those around her, and eventually food altogether. (It’s even more aesthetically arresting knowing that it released in South Korea a full eight years prior.) I’ve followed her ever since, from the thematically similar Greek Lessons to the true-to-life South Korean political atrocities in Human Acts and We Do Not Part, and I cannot implore you enough to read Han Kang. She is a genius andabsolute badass. –LB\nNotable works: We Do Not Part, The Vegetarian, Human Acts, Greek Lessons\nNewly published but already on her way to releasing a third novel, Yume Kitasei is an imaginative sci-fi writer with a promising career ahead of her. While many of my favorite sci-fi writers tend to have expansive series, Kitasei's one-off stories delightfully build their worlds quickly, and their engaging stories move even faster. Her debut, The Deep Sky, is a neat murder mystery aboard a tech-filled spaceship bound for the hopeful future home of humanity that was hard to put down. Her follow-up, The Stardust Grail, is an Indiana Jones-style adventure as its protagonist races her enemies to find an ancient alien artifact that is the key to her friend's survival but potentially the doom of her own. Both are lovely and imaginative, and I can't wait to read her next novel that's out later this fall. –MS\nNotable works: The Deep Sky, Stardust Grail\nPerfect for kids just getting started in fantasy. –MF\nNotable works: Ella Enchanted\nSarah J. Mass is a queen in the fantasy romance genre who constantly leaves me jaw-dropped with everything she has created. Her world-building and storytelling are so incredibly detailed, that she quickly became one of my favorite fantasy authors. She’s generally best known for the remarkable series A Court of Thorns and Roses – currently a five-book series with more releases coming – which dives into a story about a young woman who ends up living in a magical realm. In it, she finds her confidence and strength while battling through internal and external wars among the Fae – who are basically humans with super strength, magical powers, and immortality. Her first series was Throne of Glass, an amazing eight-book series that started her fantasy writing and world-building when she was only a teenager. Her latest series, Crescent City, has three books so far, with a fourth to come. All three of her series take place in the fantasy world of the Fae, so when readers are fans of one of her series, they tend to enjoy the others as well. Mass’ ability to develop strong characters and exciting twists leaves her stories equally entwined with the fantastical elements of the story and the romance side of things. For those looking for epic fantasy stories with romance and a bit of spice, jump into the Fae world with these books. –Jessie Wade\nNotable works: A Court of Thorns and Roses, Throne of Glass, Crescent City\nThere seemingly isn't a genre Silvia Moreno-Garcia won't tackle. Whether it's a historical romance with a touch of fantasy in The Beautiful Ones or a dark vampire adventure set in Mexico City in Certain Dark Things, Moreno-Garcia nails it every time. Some of her romance-forward stories feel a little similar in their dynamics if you read them back to back, but it's easy to make sure that doesn't happen if you're new to her small library of published works. The majority of her works tend to skew toward dark historical fantasy set throughout North America – and, more often than not, in Mexico, which is wonderfully refreshing. Anything she publishes has a guaranteed spot on my limited bookshelf space. –MS\nNotable works: Mexican Gothic, Gods of Jade and Shadow, Silver Nitrate\nErin Morganstern's two novels, The Night Circus and The Starless Sea, read like falling into a dream. Morganstern is another of the very few authors whose books I will not only buy in hardcover instantly but also grab multiple copies to collect the various editions. The Night Circus is a luscious, historical fantasy romance about two magicians trained since childhood for their inevitable battle against one another at a mysterious circus. It's guaranteed to break me out of a reading slump whenever I pick it up again and was the book that drew me back into regularly reading as an adult. (Sometimes you've gotta not look at a screen, as much as I love spending my time playing video games.)  Her second novel, The Starless Sea, is a winding, enchanting story about stories. It begins in the world we know before protagonist Zachary finds his way into an underground realm that serves as the library of all stories and it's in danger. Like her debut, The Starless Sea is wonderfully written and best paired with a warm cup of tea. –MS\nNotable works: The Night Circus, The Starless Sea\nI get a little giddy when I hear that a new Helen Oyeyemi book is on its way. A truly singular voice, Oyeyemi is hard to pin down in a way that’s like – stick with me here – trying to chase down a wispy ghost that’s purposefully messing with you but you’re still having a great time anyway. Her novels are fantastical, but aren’t really fantasy at all; a chunk of them are inspired by Hans Christian Anderson folktales, but the look and feel could not be further from their progenitors. (Gingerbread, for example, is vaguely Hansel and Gretel-ish put through a capitalist meat grinder.) Mostly they’re all fever dream adventures that nuke the rules of literary fiction. As another great writer Alexandra Kleemansaid to The Nation, Oyeyemi’s work has “the discombobulating quality of walking through a moving vehicle while carrying a full-to-the-brim cup of very hot tea.” –LB\nNotable works: Parasol Against the Axe, Gingerbread, Boy Snow Bird, Mr. Fox\nTummy Bugs is a collection of over a decade of work from Leomi Sadler and full of bright colors and dark humor. –KP\nNotable works: Tummy Bugs\nFor those of you who have been mourning the end of the Game of Thrones TV show and are waiting rather impatiently for George R.R. Martin to finally publish The Winds of Winter, Samantha Shannon is here to ease your suffering. The Roots of Chaos series, starting with The Priory of the Orange Tree, is exactly the kind of high fantasy series we all deserve. With rich characters, dragons, magic, suspense, tragedy, and a satisfying twist, this 845-page book will keep you on the edge of your seat and immersed in another world for as long as you let it. Another prequel, A Day of Fallen Night, was published only three years later, but excitement continues with yet another prequel, Among the Burning Flowers, which will be coming out later this year. If you've been itching to start a new series, this is the perfect time to jump in. –CR\nNotable works: The Roots of Chaos series (The Priory of the Orange Tree), The Bone Season series\nGail has been writing comics (and other media) for a long time and has done amazing work in portraying the quiet but no less powerful moments in superheroes’ lives. She has won GLAAD awards and is the first female solo writer for Uncanny X-Men. She is more amazing than a short blurb can say. Check her out! –MF\nNotable works: Uncanny X-Men. You can pre-order the next release (August 5) onAmazonnow.\nSue Lynn Tan's debut, Daughter of the Moon Goddess, is a gorgeous reimagining and expansion of the Chinese legend of the moon goddess and continues with its follow-up, Heart of the Sun Warrior. Together, they are the most delicious romantic adventures I've read. The duology eloquently gives context to Chinese mythology for those unfamiliar with it while keeping the pace of the action steady. As the first book's title suggests, the hidden daughter of the exiled moon goddess, Xingyin, takes the role of protagonist when she's sent into hiding among the Celestial Kingdom while her mother must continue her imprisonment on the moon. Determined to set her mother free, Xingyin goes on an epic, inspiring adventure to set things right. Tan's complex characters and strong understanding of romantic pacing make these instant standouts among romantic fantasy novels. –MS\nNotable works: The Celestial Kingdom Duology (Daughter of the Moon Goddess), Immortal\nMorgan's work is visceral and intelligent, beautifully drawn but also deeply unsettling. It captures the weight of being lost online, in the world, or within yourself. –KP\nNotable works: Nightcore Energy, Valle\nWritten for young adults, Jacqueline Wilson's works touch on hard-to-talk-about topics such as grief and loss, substance abuse, bullying, and abandonment. I grew up reading Wilson's books, and could often relate to her characters due to my own tough upbringing. I would often escape to my local library and bury myself in one of her books to feel less alone in what I was going through. She has won several awards for her work, including a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (basically the best award you can get!) by King Charles III for her \"services to Literature.\" –Meg Koepp\nNotable works: \"Girls\" series, Think Again, The Illustrated Mum\nRebecca Yarros’sEmpyrean seriesis a striking adult fantasy romance that follows a young woman’s experience going to a war college for dragon riders. If you can imagine humans working with dragons to prepare for war, you can guess (correctly) that it’s brutal right off the bat. Even though violence takes a prominent, integral role in the books, it doesn’t overtake the importance of the storyline itself, the characters, and the world-building. Yarros does a phenomenal job creating relatable characters who deal with serious challenges, both physical and mental, they need to learn to overcome, but there’s a theme of friendship and support throughout. The romance is woven into the story in an organic way that complements the plot well, while still keeping the excitement in the fantasy world. Even for those not interested in the romance side of it, you’ll likely end up adoring the characters’ experiences together and crave more of it the further you read. Yarros has this ability to create such complex storylines with so many unexpected twists and turns, leaving you constantly hyped. She reveals more of her worlds as she goes on through the books, and when I say she’ll crush your world and then rebuild it (hopefully), I mean it. You’ll be surprised how attached you get to dragons and think of them as real people. The Empyrean series is a five-book series and the third book was released on January 21, 2025, with two still to come. –JW\nNotable works: Empyrean Series (Fourth Wing, Iron Flame, and Onyx Storm)\nFor more, also check out Humble Bundle's great deals and specials this month for gamers and readers.Humble is partnering with CARE for Women’s History Month.

    "title": "John Carpenter Reveals There's a 'Hint' About Who Turns Into The Thing — And This Fan May Have Worked the Whole Thing Out",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-24T15:40:12Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/john-carpenter-reveals-theres-a-hint-about-who-turns-into-the-thing-and-this-fan-may-have-worked-the-whole-thing-out",
    "full_text": "Part of the magic of John Carpenter’s legendary 1982 sci-fi horror filmThe Thingis that the ending is left ambiguous. For the past 43 years, fans have wondered whether R.J. MacReady, played by Kurt Russell, or Childs, played by Keith David, turns into the movie’s central monster at the end, but Carpenter intentionally left fans guessing with absolutely no clues to how things shook down — until now.\n\nThe master of horror revealed to Parasite and Mickey 17 director Bong Joon Ho at a special 4K screening of The Thing at the David Geffen Theater in Los Angeles on March 22 thatthere is a “giant hint”in the middle of the film reveals who eventually turns into The Thing at the end of the film. He went on to joke that he would reveal that coveted knowledge to anyone who sent an undisclosed sum of money “in an envelope to my house.”\nCarpenter also told the crowd that the actors themselves didn’t even know who would ultimately end up becoming The Thing. “They had no clue,” he admitted. “But they had to play it human, you see. The creature imitates perfectly. It could be one of us, it could be somebody in the audience, and there’s no way of telling. So I knew, they didn’t know.”\nAs for the hint itself, indie director Joe Russo (notMCU favorite Joe Russo) unleashed his theory on the world via X / Twitter following the screening. “I think I found that hint,”Russo wrote.\nRusso noted that MacReady is told about the notion that the creature can replicate at the cellular level, which means that, for their safety, they should only be eating or drinking things that they alone have had contact with. Despite knowing this crucial detail, MacReady shares his liquor with Childs at the end of the film. This could potentially mean MacReady just forgot what he was told, but in Russo’s theory it more likely means he is, in fact, The Thing. \"As soon as Childs drinks from the bottle, The Thing has won,” Russo says. “It’s beaten its most skeptical, final threat.”\nOf course, the brilliance of Carpenter’s film is that it ends before any of that is confirmed. But Russo offered further supporting evidence. He noted the last line of the film — \"Why don't we just wait here for a little while, see what happens?\" — is very apropos to the situation if MacReady has already become The Thing. The filmmaker’s thread also has an explanation for the moment we see MacReady kill The Thing: “[Did you see that] OR… did you watch a BETTER imitation kill a POORER imitation because it had a better chance of infiltrating society upon rescue.\"\nSome fans were definitely swayed by the theory, while others were stuck on the notion that Childs is the one who becomes the creature. \"I still think it’s Childs because we don’t know his whereabouts for a long time heading into the final scene. But Keith David will tell you he’s 100% not The Thing,\"one fan added to the thread. Russo replied: \"Carpenter said both actors don't know... Childs always felt like a red herring to me.\"\nEither way, it’s definitely a theory worth considering. Carpenter still manages to surprise and delight fans all these years later, and we’re lucky to still be getting bits and pieces of his wisdom.\nLex Briscuso is a film and television critic and a freelance entertainment writer for IGN.

    "full_text": "High hopes, high hopes, Paul Walter Hauser is giving us high hopes.The Fantastic Four: First Stepsis on the horizon, and Hauser is hyping up the movie with some extremely choice words that, if proven correct, might mean this is one of the best MCU films in recent years.\n\n\"So I think our movie, Fantastic Four: First Steps, to me, only speaking from my opinion, everything I witnessed and took part in, everything I felt while in the presence of the creatives on the film, I believe we are the Marvel movie of the year,” Hauser, who isplaying a still-undisclosed role in the film, toldTheDirectin a recent interview. “I believe we are the one to watch.\"\nHauser, who is starring in the upcoming filmThe Luckiest Man In America, even went as far as to compare the film to two of the most highly regarded MCU outputs ever. \"And I believe that this will go down in history as one of the ones that started a new tide of successful storytelling for the company,” he added. “Sort of in the same way theGuardians of the GalaxyandBlack Pantherhit. They both hit in a certain way. I believe we are about to hit.\"\nThat said, the Richard Jewell actor also noted that, you know, if itdoesend up being bad, everyone has bad days — I mean, movies. \"Let's remember thatMarvel is servicing a lot of folks, and they want to make a lot of entertainment for people to enjoy, and none of us are 100%. None of us hit the mark every time,” Hauser said. “Not a single one of us. Your favorite director has made a less than satisfactory movie.

    "full_text": "There’s no denying the Russo Brothers’ new Netflix filmThe Electric Statehas been the talk of the town since it debuted on Friday — and with the industry’s climate the way it is, fans have certainly been discussing itsuse of AI.\n\nThat said, Joe Russo, who alongside his brother Anthony directed Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, has defended the use of AI for voice modulation in The Electric State, claiming it was “something any 10-year-old could do after watching a TikTok video.”\n\"There’s a lot of finger-pointing and hyperbole because people are afraid,” Joe Russo insisted in an interview withThe Times. “They don’t understand. But ultimately you’ll see AI used more significantly.\"\nThe filmmaker added that he sees potential in the technology. \"Also, AI is in its generative state now, where it has, as we call them, hallucinations. You can’t do mission-critical work with something that hallucinates,” Russo said. “That is a reason self-driving cars haven’t taken over, or why AI surgery is not taking place worldwide. But in its generative state, AI is best suited towards creativity.\"\nWhile many artists across a whole host of disciplines feel AI is actually the antithesis of creativity, it seems as though some of the studios are excited to use the tech when it’s ready to be implemented. Back in July 2024, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos claimed thataudiences “don’t care” if AI is used in the film and television programming they watch. Sarandos doubled down and asserted that the tech is \"a great way for creators to tell better stories.\"\n\"Animation didn't get cheaper, it got better in the move from hand-drawn to CG animation, and more people work in animation today than ever in history,\" Sarandos said on the call. \"So I'm pretty sure there's a better business and a bigger business in making content 10% better than there is in making it 50% cheaper.\"\nFor what it’s worth, not everyone seems to be embracing AI right off the bat. Last month,Marvel denied using AIto create teaser posters for the upcomingThe Fantastic Four: First Steps, despite one of the people in the imagery sporting a four-fingered hand.\nThe Electric State was directed and produced by Anthony and Joe Russo from a script by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, which was loosely adapted from a 2018 illustrated novel by Simon Stalenhag. The movie stars Millie Bobby Brown, Chris Pratt, Ke Huy Quan, Woody Harrelson, Jason Alexander, Anthony Mackie, Jenny Slate, Giancarlo Esposito, Brian Cox, and Stanley Tucci.\nIGN'sThe Electric State reviewreturned a 4/10. We said: \"Marvel’s biggest hitmakers join forces again with the Netflix algorithm to deliver The Electric State, a $300-million anti-event movie.\"\nThe Russo Brothers are down to direct the next two Avengers movies for Marvel Studios: 2026's Avengers: Doomsday and 2027's Avengers: Secret Wars.\nLex Briscuso is a film and television critic and a freelance entertainment writer for IGN.

    "full_text": "UPDATE March 27 2025:Paramount Pictures confirmed Steven Yeun's involvement in the Aang Avatar movie with IGN via email. A spokesperson for the company also clarified that the film remains untitled despite rumors that it was in development with the name Aang: The Last Airbender.\n\nORIGINAL STORY March 27 2025:Invincible and The Walking Dead star Steven Yeun has reportedly joinedthe upcoming animated Aang Avatar movie.\nDetails on Yeun’s involvement come fromVariety, which reports the versatile star has been picked up to be a part of the film’s cast in an undisclosed role. It means we could hear him lend his voice acting talents as a new character from any one of the project’s Earth, Air, Fire, and Water kingdoms. There’s also the chance we see him play a familiar character, too, though the animated film's plot details also remain tightly under wraps.\nVariety's report also states the Aang Avatar movie is currently \"untitled\" after previously being referred to as Aang: The Last Airbender. It's unclear if that title idea has been dropped by Paramount Pictures.\nYeun made a name for himself as The Walking Dead’s baseball cap-wearing Glen before eventually branching out to appear in shows likeNetflix’s award-winning Beefas well as movies like Nope and, more recently, Mickey 17. He’s also managed to cement himself as a more-than-capable voice actor, too. Amazon Prime Video’s Invincible, where he leads as the superhero series’ titular character, is no doubt his most notable voice acting credit, but he’s also got an important history with the Avatar universe.\nSequel series The Legend of Korra spends a good chunk of Book Two, its second season, diving into Yeun's character, Wan. A long-deceased man with deep ties to the spirit world – and the very first Avatar – Wan is undoubtedly an important name in Avatar canon. It would make sense to see Aang: The Last Airbender explore its lead’s relationship with the first master of all four elements. Then again, Yeun could surely make sense in a new role, too.\nIGN has reached out to Paramount for comment.\nChoosing how The Walking Dead alum fits into the 2026 film is up to co-directors Lauren Montgomery and William Mata. The duo is already hard at work alongside original creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, who remain attached as executive producers. The project is part ofa trilogy of animated worksfrom the Avatar team.\nAang: The Last Airbender, the first of the three films, is scheduled topremiere January 30, 2026. It will starsinger/songwriter Eric Nam as the titular Airbender, with Guardians of the Galaxy and Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery star Dave Bautista also apart of its cast.\nWith less than a year to go before its planned release date, we’ll surely hear more about how its story will expand upon the beloved universe in the coming months.

    "full_text": "At CinemaCon in Las Vegas, Amazon MGM gave attendees a first look at what to expect from next year’s new Masters of the Universe film - and what they showed was very promising.\n\nWith the film only recently beginning production, no actual completed footage was shown, but rather a message from set from director Travis Knight (Kubo and the Two Strings, Bumblebee) and stars Nicholas Galitzine (“He-Man”) and Camila Mendes (“Teela”), followed by a montage of behind-the-scenes/on-set footage mixed with production artwork.\nKnight noted he grew up a huge Masters of the Universe fan, which feels apparent seeing the designs for the film, which are incredibly accurate to the original toy line and animated series from the 1980s - much like what Knight did in Bumblebee with the Transformers. Production artwork of characters like the Sorceress (Morena Baccarin) and Evil-Lyn (Alison Brie) looked right out of the source material and were instantly recognizable.\nSome of the characters actually shown on set in the midst of production included Trap Jaw (Sam C. Wilson) and Tri-Klops (Kojo Attah), and it was amazing how much they truly looked like the original toys in a slightly more modernized form, with someone like Trap Jaw still retaining all of his recognizable elements, including his gun arm, blue body and green face - and yes, a trap jaw! It appears Knight has managed the delicate balancing act of keeping these bigger than life characters looking wild and cool, without feeling too goofy in live-action form.\nBrief on set footage of Jared Leto as Skeletor kept him in the shadows, but production art and glimpses of makeup being applied indicate he will likely also be sporting the character’s blue skin from the toy line, unlike the version in the 1987 Masters of the Universe movie.\nGalitzine looked appropriately buff and blond to play He-Man, having gained a lot of muscle mass from how he looked in movies like Red, White & Royal Blue and Bottoms, and we saw glimpses of the weight and fight training he’s gone through for the film - and got a look at He-Man’s iconic Power Sword, looking appropriately intimidating. We also saw Mendes getting in some stunt work, including running along a wall with the aid of a harness.\nThe only thing that felt odd, given He-Man’s typical fictional background, were moments on set showing Adam, He-Man’s alter-ego, in what looked like an American suburban bedroom. The 1987 film notably saved money by having most of the story involve He-Man transported to Earth, but it feels very unlikely that will occur again here, as we saw huge sets had been built for Eternia in the footage. But is there some sort of set-up with Adam mistakenly believing he’s an Earthling initially for some reason? That might explain the role Agatha All Along’s Sasheer Zamata is playing, a character with the very normal-sounding name “Suzie,” who has been described as Adam’s best friend.\nTime will tell, with Masters of the Universe set to open June 5, 2026."

TheMail on Sundaysaid that Amazon circulated an internal memo stipulating James Bond would not change gender or nationality under its tenure.\nThat’s sure to please Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, who played Bond in GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, and Die Another Day from 1995 to 2002. Speaking toThe Telegraph, Brosnan said ‘it’s a given’ that 007 should be British.\nHowever, if an actor from the Commonwealth is possible, that leaves the door open to Australian Chris Hemsworth, who has expressed his interest in playing the character in the past. In 2019, the Thor and Extraction star toldBalancemagazine, after the publication pointed out his performance as British Formula One driver James Hunt made him a perfect candidate: “When we were shooting Rush someone had said that and I thought, ‘Cool, if this is my audition tape, then great.’ I don’t think you’ll ever meet anyone who doesn’t want to have a crack at James Bond. I’d love to do it.\n“But that’s up to so many elements and is way beyond myself; it’s not one you can pitch yourself on to either. It’s something that the community of Bond fans, Barbara Broccoli and the whole crew there agree on, and it has to be a very organic decision from them. There have been a lot of names thrown out there and a lot of brilliant people can tackle that one.”\nHemsworth's comments have now resurfaced following the Mail on Sunday's report and word that a man from the Commonwealth could play Bond. TheToday Show Australiatook the speculation and declared: \"It's a surety. He is in.\"\nThere is a degree of concern about the future of James Bond following Amazon’s acquisition and the stepping back of long-term 007 producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson.\nAmid speculation that Amazon may decide to go with a Bond TV series,Varietyreported that a new Bond film is still the “top priority.” As for what’s next, Amazon will allegedly first look for a producer for the franchise. Apparently David Heyman, who shepherded the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films with a cohesive vision, is the kind of producer Amazon is looking for.\nChristopher Nolan reportedly “expressed interest” in directing a Bond movieafterTenet, but Broccoli allegedly insisted no director would have “final cut” while she was in charge of the franchise and turned him down. Nolan went on to makeOppenheimer, which made nearly $1 billion at the global box office and won the best picture and best director (Nolan) Oscars.\nAmazon’s control over Bond hasn’t gone down well with some.LonglegsandThe Monkeydirector was asked during a recent Reddit AMA whether he’d be op-en to directing a Bond movie, andhis answerwas loud and clear: “No, because f**k Jeff Bezos.”\nFans are particularly keen to know who will play Bond next. While some are calling for the likes of Venom star Tom Hardy, the MCU's Idris Elba, Professor X actor James McAvoy, Magneto actor Michael Fassbender, and Kraven’s Aaron Taylor-Johnson (who was previously rumored to be top of the list),the clear fan-favorite is Superman and The Witcher star Henry Cavill.\nAccording to Variety, Amazon is unable to hire anyone on Bond until the closure of its Broccoli-Wilson deal, which is expected at some point this year. The news followed an explosive report that alleged the future of the James Bond franchise was “on pause” amid what was described as an “ugly” stalemate between the Broccoli family and Amazon.\nThe behind-the-scenes battle between Barbara Broccoli, who had retained creative control over Bond and decided who played the iconic British spy, and Amazon, which acquired the right to release Bond movies afterit bought Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in a deal worth $8.45 billion back in 2021, had left Bond “trapped,” theWall Street Journalreported.\nAmazon and Eon have yet to issue a comment.\nPhoto by Tuane Fernandes/picture alliance via Getty Images.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    "full_text": "A Minecraft Moviehad a massive opening weekend at the box office and sparked pandemonium inside theaters, with popcorn being thrown, wild \"CHICKEN JOCKEY!\" screams, and even reports of police being called. But some are saying their experience was ruined by the chaos.\n\nSocial media was flooded with videos showing overly enthusiastic cinemagoers screaming lines from the movie, openly filming with their phones, throwing popcorn, and clapping rowdily.\nOne phrase in particular has risen to the top of the social media pile: \"CHICKEN JOCKEY!\" Jack Black, who plays Minecraft's famous playable character, Steve, says the line in the movie, and videos of screenings that took place over the weekend show it is sending teens delirious.\nThe line is said during a scene in which Black and Jason Momoa face a cuboid Minecraft chicken who is ridden by a baby zombie in a boxing ring. Black’s Steve declares \"CHICKEN JOCKEY!\" after the baby zombie falls from a crate onto the chicken; a reference to the video game itself, where certain baby zombie characters are sometimes found riding a chicken.\nGiven these fans had already seen thechicken jockeyscene via a Minecraft trailer released in February, they were primed for release when they saw the movie in the cinema. And now, the chicken jockey line has taken on a life of its own, going viral on social media which in turn is fueling even more intense reaction.\nthe minecraft movie is truly one of the worst movies i’ve ever seen but the universal reaction to “chicken jockey” im seeing made it all worth it.pic.twitter.com/0mxgliSYEp\nOne person who filmed the reaction, X / Twitter user @ollie_twt, described the scenes: \"the people behind me took their shirts off as well as the ones in the front that were standing. That was by far the loudest theater I’ve ever been in and it was awesome.\"\nHappened to overhear a Chicken Jockey momentpic.twitter.com/TUvwMqrZRq\nOne TikTok video viewed by IGN shows a person carrying another on their shoulders, mimicking the chicken jockey itself. Another video, below, shows a teen standing ready to throw two popcorn buckets' worth of popcorn over the audience during the chicken jockey scene.\nAnother shows similar popcorn-throwing scenes:\nThere are even reports of police being called to eject members of the audience, and complaints from theater employees who have taken to social media and online forums to say people throwing drinks and popcorn makes their jobs even harder.\nWhile it’s clear a significant portion of the Minecraft movie audience is loving all the chaos, there are a number of fans who have expressed frustration that their experience was ruined by all the shouting and clapping.\nI need to know, are there people who actually enjoy watching a movie like this?pic.twitter.com/v9NSSe0sqd\nThen there are the bemused audience members who aren't in on the joke. Parents taking their young children, friends and family members who aren't as... online as the rest of us.\nWarner Bros. will no doubt be delighted by the virality of A Minecraft Movie, of course, as it heads into its second weekend.It’s already secured an incredible $301 million during opening weekend. Could it eventually beat The super Mario Bros. Movie as the highest-grossing video game adaptation of all time?\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

    "title": "Assassin's Creed Shadows Review",
    "publishedAt": "2025-03-18T17:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review",
    "full_text": "It’s wild that it took almost 20 years and dozens of games for the biggest stealth action series around to finally bend towards feudal Japan. Assassin's Creed Shadows makes the most of that theme, with a great pair of shinobi and samurai heroes sharing center stage that are well-written and fun to skulk through giant castles or wade into vicious battles with. Besides the setting, the bulk of the changes this time focus on making smaller tweaks to well-established systems, such as less cluttered maps and skill trees, while also doubling down on things that really worked in 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage, like the more focused and tougher combat that accompanies its better paced main quests. It’s not a perfect reset, as imbalances and missed opportunities abound, but I feel more confident than ever that Assassin’s Creed could be back and here to stay.\n\nLike a river in the rainy season, Shadows’ story overflows with cliches that are signature to fiction set in this era. Warriors wander the land to bring honor to themselves and their masters. Absent rulers let wealthy bureaucrats exploit the poor. Bandits hold the countryside in the cold grip of fear. If you’re a fan of James Clavell’s Shogun or the excellent movies of Akira Kurosawa, you have certainly seen the bulk of what protagonists Yasuke and Naoe are made to navigate. This isn’t a bad thing, and morally complex intersecting plots still keep the intrigue high, which is the same trick that made Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s stories work when they did. I don’t think I was particularly wowed by the writing on a regular basis, but there are some standout moments of tense reflection and curious happenings sprinkled throughout. The typical Assassin’s Creed conspiracy woven into it fits perfectly within the war torn Sengoku period of Japan, too, like a hidden blade snugly in its wrist sheath.\nThe leads themselves are wonderful. You spend a lot of the early game with the sharp-witted and broody Naoe, who is among the last shinobi warriors of the Iga clan, a role thrust upon her by tragedy. That tragedy befell her in part by the hands of the charismatic hulk Yasuke, who is a tireless warrior for justice and peace. When they begin working together, they are frequently each other’s most reliable consul, with sound and often different perspectives on the events going on around them. In other words, they truly do balance one another, and while I don’t think either one would win popularity contests against other series stars like Ezio or Edward, together they serve as the bright light in the center of a largely dark tale of revenge.\nThe story overall is paced similarly to Valhalla, where the cardinal reason to be in each of the nine regions of the map is to play through a mostly self-contained chapter. That said, Shadows does a better job of making sure at least some story elements and characters don’t just completely vanish when you leave a region the way they did in its predecessor. Not every new lord or business man you meet becomes completely irrelevant after you’ve solved their problems. I also found these sections, and the overall time it took to move from chapter to chapter, to be more brisk and less filled with frustrating filler than past games. It’s still a bit too full of “go here, do that” as bridges between major moments than I’d prefer, but it's organized in a way that can be enjoyed in pieces and at your leisure without getting too lost between plot points, almost like how one might read a good book.\nMost of the missions in Shadows start on the objective board, a bigger and more elaborate chart of people that need assistance and targets that need eliminating adapted from Assassin’s Creed Mirage. Thematically, this approach matches the tone of using all the information you gather to identify hidden members of the secret society trying to plunge Japan into chaos. Functionally, the way it organizes outstanding tasks and the people involved is far more useful than the old bulleted quest lists. It does trade some of the magic of exploration away as a cost of this efficacy, though. More than once I organically stumbled across a jerk that couldn’t be talked down, just to kill them and find not only his crossed out profile tacked to my board, but also the exact number of remaining silhouettes of the gang I had no idea they were a part of until right then. But it’s a trade I would make every time.\nSelecting a quest gave me a short list of clues to help discern where the objective was, which is easier to figure out depending on how well I’d searched that part of the map already. Past games have given hints to identify targets like this before, hoping to create some friction between you and the effort to find your quarry, but Shadows is the first one that I felt constantly made me look at my map and actually deduce where the spot in question might be by using those clues and some educated guesses. I could use scouts, one of the assets you can develop at your hideout, to assist in the narrowing process, pinging an area on the map and highlighting unidentified objectives in the zone. This doesn't reveal hidden locations or features of the map outside of just a marker though, so it's a bad way to clear fog of war from a distance. It will also cost one scout whether they find something or not, and scouts are replenished in very few ways, so scouting can be a real risk if you’re trying to make progress in the main story – especially early on.\nRather than lighting up your map with a galaxy of tooltips, Shadows mostly relies on sparse point-of-interest icons to push you towards the areas you’ll need to see the finer details of in-person. Even when you climb up to the signature highpoints to take a good long look at your surroundings, what you’ll see is a bevy of nondescript icons that tell you thatsomethingis out there, but you’re gonna have to hop down from that perch and go check them out for yourself to know what. I love this – I could feel my brain starting to detangle the checklist conditioning that years of these games had instilled in me. Not only did I feel compelled to just ride through the countryside and genuinely explore stuff without much expectation of grand rewards, I also felt no nagging compulsion to check off every possible thing to do in a region inorganically.\nMost of these undiscovered locations fall into one of a number of reliable categories, like castles you can infiltrate and attempt to steal special gear from or any of the many villages scattered across Japan, but you can’t be sure unless you take it in for yourself. A common thing I would always stop to handle whenever I came across them were world activities – these are smaller locations and events that, when completed, add knowledge points to your characters, increasing their knowledge levels and adding new options to their skill trees. Not all of these events are exciting, with running around temples to find missing scroll pages being my least favorite, but they often don’t take too long and the points are worth it in the end. And in the case of something like the horse archery challenges, they can add an interesting distraction from the action for a short spell.\nBetween outings, I spent some time at the hideout, this iteration of Valhalla’s Ravensthorpe settlement. After collecting minerals, crops, and wood out in the world, you can use those resources to build and upgrade important buildings here that give you access to new assets. I spent the majority of my time at the forge managing my equipment, while other important buildings provide more passive additions or have features that can be managed in places outside of the hideout, like the new summoning ability from the dojo which let me call in help from certain allies I met during my adventure. I’m glad I didn’t have to dote on this place very much as I personally can’t be bothered to decorate a homestead, but for those interested in that sort of thing I was absolutely flooded by the cosmetics I unlocked just in the natural course of completing tasks and looting, so you’ll never be starved for options to spice the place up.\nAssassin’s Creed Mirage’s return to the stealthy style that launched this series doesn’t do everything right, but everything it does feels like it was done with purpose. This means a shorter game with a smaller map, fewer collectibles, smaller scope in combat, and a limited selection of gear to play with – all of which I found refreshing relative to the arguably bloated scale of 100-hour games like Odyssey and Valhalla. It also means an overly simplistic plot with mostly forgettable characters, but what the story lacks in depth it makes up for with its straightforward quest progression and fast pacing. Though there's no big standout “wow” moment, Baghdad is a beautiful location in its own right, and the world’s detail is focused inward, making every alley and hovel feel well traveled and full of detail and history. I’d recommend Mirage to anyone who’s lapsed on Assassin’s Creed, as its back-to-basics approach is a successful first step in returning the feeling that the earlier industry-defining games gave me so long ago.– Jarrett Green, October 4, 2023\nRead the fullAssassin's Creed Mirage review\nThe real sightseeing, though, is out in the world. 1500s Japan is a beautiful place – there’s such a symphony of color over every hill and across every lake. Each season brings with it incredible landscapes, sometimes covered in the reddish brown of Autumn or entombed in deep white snow. In fact, I found the weather to be some of the best I’d ever experienced in an open world. It was hard not to be moved watching powerful winds pick up and bring in rolling thunderstorms, especially when watching how nature reacted to it all in real time, as flocks of birds took flight and ground critters scurry around to find safety. And not for nothing, but in my dozens of hours in Shadows I encountered remarkably few bugs for a game this size.\nThe main 40-hour story revolves around the dual protagonists attempting to unmask and eliminate members of a deadly organization called the Shinbakufu. Once you’ve chosen a target, the multi-mission arcs give you regular opportunities to handle a situation with either Yasuke’s might or Naoe’s stealth. However, while there are certainly scenarios where one is more useful than the other, in general, there are remarkably few quests where Naoe isn’t better suited for the task at hand. This comes down to how their abilities are divided between them. If the classic Assassin’s Creed playstyle is the combination of exploration, parkour, stealth, and combat, Naoe can do all of these competently and excels at parkour and stealth. Yasuke, meanwhile, can’t climb very well or sneak around much due to his size and general lack of grace. He is a devastating force in combat – maybe the most overbearing and dominant protagonist in the series – but Naoe can simply sneak around most situations that Yasuke would cut his way through, solving them with so much less trouble if done well. As much as I like Yasuke, he’s far more limited and one dimensional in his style, with large parts of this game not quite designed to take advantage of his strengths in a way that feels intentional.\nIt's particularly disappointing because Shadows does find ways to tailor missions around both of their skills on occasion, usually in bigger, more pivotal and important battles where both heroes need to operate together to succeed. These special missions are separated into sections that allow you to choose which character to proceed with, changing what’s asked of you depending on your choice. In a later game mission, Naoe is securing the perimeter of the castle walls, taking out gunmen, while Yasuke storms the place demanding to challenge this chapter’s foe to a duel for the lives of his hostages. Depending on who you play as, you’re either weaving through blockades to drop specific soldiers without alerting the whole castle, or you’re having a fierce duel against a powerful samurai. It's awesome, and made the more homogenous space between these moments a real bummer.\nCombat overall is more challenging than in the past. Enemies, especially in groups, are more aggressive, relying on combos and unblockable attacks as often as possible. They also tend to have solid defenses, both in that they block a lot and also in that many of them are armored, essentially giving them a second life bar. Effectively taking them down means having a solid defense of your own, dodging and deflecting their blows to make them vulnerable, and taking advantage before they recover. It requires a more thoughtful execution of your various abilities than previous games have, and I never felt like combat was a chore in and of itself – though the camera really struggled to keep all of the action in frame, and doubly so when inside buildings.\nStraightforward combat really sings when playing as Yasuke, whose set of swords, naginata, kanabo, bows, and even guns are all perfect for decimating enemies. He is a juggernaut of a man outside of his toys, being able to literally run through walls and shake the earth with his blows. He’s also tough and can take many more blows before succumbing to his wounds. Naoe is very fragile by comparison, and while capable of doing lots of damage when enemies are vulnerable, she struggles to stagger them without the help of her tools. She gets overwhelmed easily by mobs, especially well-armored bruisers, and when the numbers get above three or four foes, I almost always found it better to drop a smoke bomb and disappear versus attempting to fight them all in an open melee.\nOn the flipside, Naoe is a menace when striking from the shadows or catching enemies unaware. This Assassin’s Creed takes the “Shadows” in its name seriously, with darkness being a key part of her stealth gameplan. There are some new features that help her out, like being able to crawl and dodge while prone, as well as some returning ones like her Eagle Sense, which lets you see silhouettes of enemies through walls. The long-missing double assassination is back too, and all of these add up to make Naoe one of the most robust assassins in the series. Yasuke can’t hold a candle to his ninja counterpart in this arena.\nEnhancing your combat abilities is mercifully less tedious than Valhalla’s skill constellation. Naoe and Yasuke have skill trees focused on their weapons and specialities, with every node feeling far more impactful than simple passive damage bonuses (which still exist, but in small amounts). Gaining new abilities is obviously the most impactful, but some of the real hidden gems add new functionality to weapons, like being able to turn certain attacks with Naoe’s chain sickle into grapples that let you pull enemies into obstacles or off of cliffs. Yasuke and his abundance of weapons made for some skill trees I largely ignored, especially his bow and teppo, as he is such a close ranged juggernaut that I had a hard time justifying spending my admittedly plentiful skill points on a ranged strategy I never embraced.\nSpeaking of excess, Shadows takes a big step backward from the work done around your inventory in Valhalla and Mirage. There are far too many pieces of randomized, color-tiered gear to pick up from fallen foes or as forgettable quest rewards that have no chance of making it into my rotation. Base stats like damage might make them relevant as last-minute stop gaps to keep your stats in line with bad guys at your level, but only until you find that next piece of legendary gear or earn enough resources to level up a piece you already like. The skills on legendary gear, like a kanabo that turns enemies into shrapnel grenades when you break their armor, are impactful in a way that the generic percentage buffs to XYZ skill that you get from the lower tiers of gear never even come close to.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows takes a flashing blade to the series’ established norms, trimming them to a more precise form in lieu of chopping them down outright. Combat is aggressive and requires more intentional parrying and skill management than in the past, and exploring the gorgeous provinces of Sengoku-period Japan is encouraged thanks to the revamped map that deemphasizes collecting icons and checking off lists. Naoe and Yasuke are well-realized and memorable protagonists, even though most of the story they drive follows pretty predictable paths. Both have unique playstyles that bolster each other’s weaknesses, but they are ultimately imbalanced by the fact that you can make use of the stealth and exploration skills of the master shinobi far more than the superhuman strength of the samurai. This isn’t the Assassin’s Creed that will change the minds of folks that never connected with the series before, but for those of us with lots of hours logged in the Animus, the sum of Shadows’ parts provide a refreshing realignment of the series that you should not skip."

    "full_text": "Social media is currently flooded with AI-generated Studio Ghibli-inspired images as part of a trend sparked by the launch of OpenAI’s new GPT‑4o image generator — and it’s caused a vociferous debate that has seen old anti-AI comments from Hayao Miyazaki resurface.\n\nIn a demo of the new native image generation in ChatGPT and Sora led by CEO Sam Altman, OpenAI took a selfie and turned it into an image that looks like Studio Ghibli art.\nthis was a real labor of love from@gabeeegoooh. congrats gabe; excellent work!here is what we generated during the livestream:pic.twitter.com/fmHWp4d9AF\nSam Altman said on X / Twitter that OpenAI “put a lot of thought into the initial examples we show when we introduce new technology,” which suggests the Ghibli style was a deliberate choice.\nAnd, a day after the demo, Altmantweeted:\nAltman also changed his profile picture on X to a Ghibli-style image, which helped to kick off the trend we’re now seeing in which people are using the tech to create Studio Ghibli-style images or add a Studio Ghibli filter to existing images. Even the White House got in on the act with a hugely controversial tweet that sparked a major backlash online.\nIt's been 24 hours since OpenAI unexpectedly shook the AI image world with 4o image generation.Here are the 14 most mindblowing examples so far (100% AI-generated):1. Studio ghibli style memespic.twitter.com/E38mBnPnQh\nNow, comments previously issued by Hayao Miyazaki, co-founder of Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli, are bubbling back up again to express the legendary filmmaker’s distaste for automated animation.\nStudio Ghibli is of course famous for its meticulously animated, hand-drawn scenes and its dedication to the craft.The best Ghibli movies, such as Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, and Princess Mononoke, are beloved as much for the quality of their animation as their stories and characters.\nThe use of generative AI to copy the Ghibli style has caused some to point out that doing so flies directly in face of Miyazaki’s ethos on the creation of art. In 2016, in a widely-circulated clip from NHK’s documentary series NHK Special: Hayao Miyazaki — The One Who Never Ends, Miyazaki was shown an AI-generated monster with \"creepy\" movement that might have been applied to a zombie video game. The person leading the demo explained that AI could “present us grotesque movements that we humans can’t imagine.”\nIn response, Miyazaki said: \"Every morning, not in recent days, I see my friend who has a disability,” Miyazaki said. “It’s so hard for him just to do a high five; his arm with stiff muscle can’t reach out to my hand. Now, thinking of him, I can’t watch this stuff and find it interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is.”\n“I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all,\" Miyazaki added. \"I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.”\nNear the end of the clip, after hearing that the animators’ goal is to create a machine that “draws pictures like humans do,” Miyazaki said: “I feel like we are nearing to the end of the times. We humans are losing faith in ourselves.”\nA reminder of Miyazaki’s take on AI: “I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all. … this is an insult to life itself … I feel like we’re nearing the end of times … We humans are losing faith in ourselves.”pic.twitter.com/ubAnVMlio5\nOf course, Miyazaki’s comments came well before the generative AI tech we know today hit the headlines, but it stands to reason he would have a similar opinion of what’s happening online this week.\nThat’s a sentiment shared by actress and director Zelda Williams, who took to social media to join the backlash.\n“People are gleefully sharing ‘Studio Ghibli style’ AI memes and photos, as though the man himself wouldn’t absolutely despise the technological piracy and negative effects on our environment.\n“Anyway, go watch Princess Mononoke in theaters tonight, and f*** AI.”\nThen, in a subsequent post, Williams continued: “The amount of ‘get used to it’, ‘it’s fun’, ‘stop whining’ that I see in response to anti-AI sentiments is wild.\n“I can’t stop you from using the stupid, water wasting, s**tty facsimile machines, in the same way you can’t stop me from talking about how deeply empty life will become if we relegate the pursuit of art or knowledge to a machine because some people don’t like the effort of learning, whether that’s an artistic skill or homework in school.\n“Lazy doesn’t just affect the body, it rots the mind.”\nRoger Clark, the actor behind Red Dead Redemption's Arthur Morgan, also slammed this latest AI trend. Taking toX / Twitter, Clark said:\n\"This Studio Ghibli stuff is so depressing. It seems that there’s a new breed of ‘artist’ that invests absolutely nothing into their creative process. You can’t type a string of words into a prompt a couple of times and pretend it’s an artistic process.\n\"You’re not even coming up with your own style. You’re piggybacking off of someone else’s hard work and inspiration. You’re a lazy thief.\n\"You’re hurting the original art, you’re hurting your audience and you’re hurting yourself.\"\nIn a more recenttweet, Altman said: \"one man's slop is another man's treasure.\"\nThere are now questions being raised about whether the AI model was trained on Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli’s work, and, if so, whether OpenAI had a license to do that training.\nOpenAI, which is already fighting copyright lawsuits over ChatGPT, said the new tool would take a “conservative approach” in the way it mimics the aesthetics of individual artists.\n“We added a refusal which triggers when a user attempts to generate an image in the style of a living artist,” it said. But the company added in a statement that it “permits broader studio styles — which people have used to generate and share some truly delightful and inspired original fan creations.”\nGenerative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. The game failed, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

    "title": "75 Marvel Comics That Inspired Avengers: Doomsday",
    "publishedAt": "2025-04-01T13:02:34Z",
    "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/75-marvel-comics-avengers-doomsday-will-pull-from-cast-reveal",
    "full_text": "One of the reasons the MCU has been so successful over the years is that this shared universe leans heavily on the comic book source material. These movies aren’t usually direct adaptations of any one comic, but they always draw on iconic storylines and runs and make that classic material accessible to a wider audience. Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars will be no exceptions. These upcoming movies are inspired by both the original 1984 crossover Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars and 2015’s Secret Wars.\n\nMore From the MCU:How Many Minutes of Screen Time Can Each Avenger Really Get in Doomsday?\nBut that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Now that we know themain cast of Avengers: Doomsday, we’re getting a clearer picture of which Marvel Comics storylines are inspiring this epic MCU adventure. From epic crossovers likeAvengers vs. X-Mento the debut of the Illuminati to two different versions of Secret Wars, these are the 75 Marvel comics that give us a better idea of whatAvengers: DoomsdayandAvengers: Secret Warsare about.\nAs seen in:The Avengers Vol. 5 #35-44, New Avengers Vol. 3 #24-33 (2015)\nAgain, Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars are heavily inspired by the two Secret Wars comics. This much we know from Kevin Feige and the Russo Bros. themselves, who are coming back to Marvel direct the films. But while we’ll get to Secret Wars itself in a bit, it’s worth starting out by focusing on the long, dramatic buildup to the 2015 comics version. That storyline, Avengers: Time Runs Out, will probably end up informing the plot of Doomsday as much as anything else.\nFrom the beginning, Jonathan Hickman’s Avengers and New Avengers titles deal with the concept ofIncursions, that phenomenon where two parallel versions of Earth begin to collide and threaten to annihilate both universes unless one of the Earths is destroyed. The Incursions are revealed to be a symptom of a larger disease in the Marvel multiverse, one that seems destined to end in the complete obliteration of all existence.\nTime Runs Out takes place in a particularly dire period for the Marvel Universe. Incursions are occurring more and more frequently, making the fight to stop them and save Earth-616 truly an existential crisis. Unfortunately, Time Runs Out also occurs in a period when the Avengers are more divided than they’ve been since the events of 2006’s Civil War. Once again, there are basically two opposing factions in this ideological battle. One law-abiding team of Avengers serves under S.H.I.E.L.D., while another group follows the Illuminati and their more pragmatic approach to survival.\nOf course, Time Runs Out is more than just an Avengers story. Members of the X-Men and Fantastic Four also play key roles. And then there’s Doctor Doom. Doom is revealed to be a pivotal player in the conflict, as he takes on a new identity as Rabum Alal and attracts a cabal of fanatical followers. Doom’s war with the extra-dimensional entities known as The Beyonders is the source of the multiverse’s impending collapse. He sees himself as the savior of existence. Others might disagree.\nWe’ve already seen some plot threads inspired by Time Runs Out crop up during the Multiverse Saga. Thanks to thepost-credits scene in 2022’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, we know Benedict Cumberbatch’s Stephen Strange has joined forces with Charlize Theron’s Clea to investigate the Incursion problem. And an Incursion forms the crux of the climax of 2023’s The Marvels, resulting in Teyonah Parris’ Monica Rambeau becoming stranded on Earth-10005, a world whereKelsey Grammer’s Beast and the rest of the X-Menare making their own stand against Incursions.\nIf Avengers: Doomsday is an adaptation of any one Marvel story, it’s definitely going to be Time Runs Out. We’re sure to see the Incursion problem reach critical mass, prompting a desperate race to stave off the end of all things. Like in the comic, we may see the Avengers split down the middle in how they deal with this threat. Though in this case, we suspect we’ll see one team rally around Anthony Mackie’s Captain America and another around Robert Downey, Jr.’s Doctor Doom. And again, we’ll see the Fantastic Four and the X-Men drawn into the fray as everyone races to save their respective world. But if Doomsday is anything like the comic, it’s all going to be for naught in the end.\nAs seen in:New Avengers - The Illuminati #1-5 (2006)\nIn the buildup to Marvel’s Civil War crossover, readers first met the Illuminati, a shadowy group that included Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Mister Fantastic, Namor, Black Bolt, and Professor X. It was revealed that this group has been quietly manipulating events in the Marvel Universe for years, always in the name of protecting Earth from threats both within and without. Marvel’s New Avengers: The Illuminati miniseries explores the group’s actions in much greater depth.\nThough they eventually disbanded, the Illuminati were reformed in Hickman’s Avengers run. The slightly revamped roster included new members like Black Panther, Beast, and Hulk (who was going through an unusually intelligent phase at the time). The Illuminati are also prominent players in Time Runs Out, resorting to questionable measures to protect Earth-616 from Incursions.\nWe already met one version of the Illuminati in the MCU in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, a group based on Earth-838. Unfortunately for them, they didn’t survive their run-in with Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch.\nBut could we meet the Earth-616 version of the Illuminati in Avengers: Doomsday? It’s hard not to come to that conclusion based solely on the cast list. What happens when you get Patrick Stewart’s Professor X, Pedro Pascal’s Reed Richards, Tenoch Huerta Mejía’s Namor, and Letitia Wright’s Black Panther in the same room? We even have to wonder if Downey’s Doom could take the place of Tony Stark here. As in the comic, we may see the Illuminati stoop to any and all measures to save their universe, even if it means damning themselves in the process.\nAs seen in:Avengers vs. X-Men #1-12 (2012)\nNormally, the Avengers and X-Men are allies in the never-ending fight to defend the Marvel Universe. But the two teams became bitter enemies in 2012’s Avengers vs. X-Men storyline.\nAvX comes at the tail end of a long period where the X-Men are fighting a losing battle to protect the mutant race from extinction. When it becomes apparent that the Phoenix Force is back and making a beeline for Earth, the X-Men see it as their last, best hope to restore the mutant population. The Avengers, however, see the Phoenix Force as a clear and present threat to everyone on Earth. That’s when the two teams come to blows.\nWe’ve already done a deep dive into Avengers vs. X-Men andthe ways in which it could inspire Avengers: Doomsday, but the gist is that we could see a very different take in the MCU on the concept of the two teams going to war. We’re not expecting a close adaptation of the comic book crossover, as the X-Men haven’t even been properly established in the MCU yet.\nInstead, we think Doomsday’s AvX conflict would involve the multiverse. It stands to reason that Grammer is reprising the same version of Beast we saw in The Marvels’ post-credits scene, and that all the other X-Men confirmed for the film are residents of that same world, which we’re assuming is Earth-10005, a.k.a. the Fox X-Men movie universe. Eventually, Earth-616 and Earth-10005 will be linked together by an Incursion, forcing the MCU’s Avengers to battle the Fox universe’s X-Men for the fate of their respective worlds.\nIn that sense, the Avengers vs. X-Men conflict in Doomsday will probably be less inspired by the AvX crossover than it will the first chapter of 2015’s Secret Wars comic. In Secret Wars #1, the Marvel multiverse is reduced to just two remaining universes, the classic Marvel Universe and the Ultimate Universe. The Avengers and Ultimates go to war as the final Incursion breaks out, only for both worlds to be annihilated in the end. Doomsday may very well end in a similar battle between the Avengers and X-Men. Instead of working together to save the multiverse, they’ll be too busy fighting each other. And that’s where Secret Wars comes in.\nAs seen in:Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #1-12 (1984), Secret Wars #1-9 (2015)\nAt this point, we might as well talk about Secret Wars proper and how it’s likely to influence both Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars. As we mentioned earlier, Marvel has published two separate but not entirely unconnected Secret Wars comics, the first in 1984 and the second in 2015. The Russos have confirmed that both comics are an influence on their upcoming Avengers movies, though we’re definitely sensing more of the latter Secret Wars so far.\nIn the original Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars, a who’s who lineup of Marvel heroes and villains are abducted by a godlike being known as The Beyonder. He whisks them away to an artificial planet called Battleworld to fight for his amusement. In the end, Doom steals The Beyonder’s power for himself, temporarily achieving the strength to match his boundless ego. Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars is also notable for introducing Spider-Man’s black costume and paving the way for Venom.\n2015’s Secret Wars, meanwhile, serves as the climax of Hickman’s sprawling Avengers run. We’ve already covered how the first issue features a desperate, doomed battle between two teams of heroes as the multiverse collapses around them. But the real meat of Secret Wars is in what happens next.\nEven as the multiverse itself dies, Doom and his ally Molecule Man (a key player in the original Secret Wars crossover) make their final stand against The Beyonders. Doom steals their power and becomes omnipotent. He uses his newfound power to form a new Battleworld out of the broken fragments of dozens of dead universes. Doom then crowns himself God Emperor of Battleworld, with each realm controlled by a different Baron. It’s sort of the Marvel version of Dune or Game of Thrones.\nAs Secret Wars unfolds, Doom fights to hold his new kingdom together while a group of refugees from Earth-616 seeks a way to restore the multiverse. Fittingly, it all comes down to a final confrontation between God Emperor Doom and his greatest rival, Reed Richards. Even as a god, Doom can’t move past his hatred for Reed and his own self-loathing.\nWe don’t know how much, if at all, we’re going to see the two Secret Wars storylines adapted in Doomsday, but Avengers: Secret Wars is shaping up to be a fairly close adaptation of those comics. Once again, we’re expecting to see Downey’s Doom achieve ultimate power and form Battleworld out of the ashes of the multiverse. We’ll probably see a great many realms inspired by both the comics and various Marvel movies of years past. We’ll almost certainly see a motley team of heroes band together to restore the multiverse, including both MCU mainstays and iconic movie favorites like Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine and Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man. If you’re wondering how Marvel could ever top the fanboy glee of the portals sequence from Endgame, that’s how.\nAs seen in:Marvel Graphic Novel #27 - Emperor Doom (1987)\nWhile the MCU is definitely drawing a lot of inspiration from Hickman’s Avengers run and Secret Wars for its portrayal of Doctor Doom, it’s worth taking a look at a much older story that also revolves around Doom crowning himself emperor. That story is 1987’s Emperor Doom graphic novel.\nEmperor Doom shows us what happens when Doom finally grows tired of ruling one measly country and sets his sights on the entire planet. After harnessing the mind-controlling powers of Purple Man, Doom brainwashes the nations of the world into accepting him as their monarch. With no one to oppose him, Doom ushers in a new era of peace and prosperity. Life under Emperor Doom is actually pretty swell, so long as you don’t mind the total lack of free will. It falls on Wonder Man to free the Avengers and mount a resistance against Emperor Doom.\nMarvel is also currently exploring a similar concept in the One World Under Doom crossover, which again sees Doom crown himself Emperor of a surprisingly docile and grateful planet.\nCould we see elements of Emperor Doom when it comes to Downey’s version of the iconic villain? It’s definitely possible. The Russos have made it clear that Doom is someone who sees himself as the hero of his own story. He thinks he’s doing what has to be done to save the Marvel multiverse. Maybe we’ll see him crown himself emperor in Avengers: Doomsday, rallying the entire world to his cause. We suspect a great many people in the MCU would be only too happy to pledge their life to a guy with Tony Stark’s face.\nAs seen in:Infamous Iron Man #1-12 (2016)\nTo be honest, we’re still trying to wrap our heads around the surprise reveal thatDowney has been cast as Doctor Doom. Why bring back the most recognizable MCU actor to play a completely different character? What’s the significance of the fact that Doom looks like Tony Stark? Is he a version of Tony from another universe where things worked out differently, or is he merely using Tony’s face to further his own agenda?\nThose are all questions we probably won’t see answered until Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters. But it certainly can’t hurt to look at one of the comics that explores the Iron Man/Doctor Doom relationship in greater depth.\nFor that, we recommend looking at 2016’s Infamous Iron Man, part of Brian Michael Bendis' larger Invincible Iron Man run. This series is set after the events of 2015’s Secret Wars. No longer a God Emperor, Victor von Doom has been healed in body and soul. He’s determined to prove himself a hero worthy of the mantle of Iron Man. And because Tony Stark himself is comatose at this point, there’s no one to actually stop Doom from giving it an honest go.\nWill Infamous Iron Man have a direct influence on Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars? It’s hard to say. Though, if nothing else, we wouldn’t be surprised if the MCU draws on Doom’s character design in this series as it introduces a Tony Stark-ified version of Doctor Doom. Downey’s character may look less like the traditional Doom than he does this version that wears a silver and green Iron Man armor.\nBut again, we know that Downey’s character is someone who sees himself as being in the right. Doom firmly believes he’s the hero. There may be elements of Infamous Iron Man that work their way into that portrayal of Doom. He’s a character who needs to win hearts and minds if he’s going to carry out his plan of saving the multiverse.\nAs seen in:Fantastic Four - 1 2 3 4 (2002)\nWith all the spectacle and cosmic stakes going on in these next two Avengers movies, it’s all the more important they find time to focus on the smaller character moments. They need to be perfectly balanced enough to satisfy even Thanos himself. Avengers: Infinity War accomplished that task by giving us moments of levity between Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Doctor Strange and zeroing in on the doomed romance between Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch and Paul Bettany’s Vision. Endgame was basically one long fat joke at the expense of Chris Hemsworth’s Thor.\nHow will Avengers: Doomsday lighten the mood? We suspect that’s going to fall on Namor’s brawny shoulders. Anyone who’s read a Fantastic Four comic featuring Namor will know that the King of Atlantis has the hots for Susan Storm. Heck, he makes Wolverine’s deep infatuation with Jean Grey seem normal by comparison. Sue, for her part, has never really reciprocated Namor’s love over the years, but that’s never stopped his incessant flirtation. Hey, he’s a fish king. He’s not used to being told no.\nGiven that Doomsday is the first MCU movie to include both Vanessa Kirby’s Sue and Tenoch Huerta Mejía’s Namor, we can only assume we’re going to see this sexual tension play out on the big screen. Expect some of the movie’s more comedic moments to come as Namor woos Sue and she rebuffs his advances. As for Pedro Pascal’s Reed? If he’s anything like the comic book version, he may be too oblivious to notice. Sue may wind up leading Namor on just to get a rise out of her single-minded science dork of a husband.\nAgain, there are any number of comics the movie could draw from in this area. Namor’s unrequited love for Sue goes back a long time. But if Doomsday pulls from any one FF comic, we’d guess it would be 2002’s Fantastic Four: 1 2 3 4. That book, which is unusually dark for an FF story, may be the closest Sue has ever come to actually responding to Namor’s advances. 1 2 3 4 is also a very Doom-centric story, so that makes it all the more likely the screenwriters might have consulted this hidden gem of a Marvel comic.\nAnd there you have it. If you want to do your homework before Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters in May 2026, you know what to read. But what Marvel storylines do you most want to see adapted in these next two Avengers movies? Let us know in the comments."

    "full_text": "The John Wick anime prequel filmfinally has a confirmed setting.\n\nAnnounced during CinemaCon, the animated movie will see Keanu Reeves return to voice his character. This is in addition toReeves’ just-confirmed return to the role in live-action form for John Wick 5.\nThe animated film prequel will tell the story of John Wick’s legendary ‘Impossible Task,’ which is referenced in the movies as helping to create the mythos — and dread — surrounding Wick’s character.\nHere’s the official blurb:\nIt will be produced by the John Wick producing team of Thunder Road’s Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee, 87Eleven Entertainment’s Chad Stahelski, and Keanu Reeves. 87Eleven Entertainment’s Alex Young and Jason Spitz will executive produce.\nThe film will be directed by Shannon Tindle, an animation veteran who most recently co-wrote and directed the Annie-nominated Netflix film Ultraman: Rising. Tindle also created the double Oscar nominee Kubo and the Two Strings and served as executive producer/showrunner on the Emmy-winning series Lost Ollie. The film will be written by Vanessa Taylor, writer and co-executive producer of Game of Thrones, writer of Divergent, and an Oscar nominee for her work with Guillermo del Toro on the Best Picture winner The Shape of Water.\nAdam Fogelson, chair of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group, said: “In both animation and the world of John Wick, the possibilities are endless. And there is no John Wick story fans are clamoring for more than the Impossible Task. Shannon’s take on that story is an incredible one, and we are beyond excited to see what John Wick can do in animation.”\nStahelski added: “I’ve always been fascinated with anime. It has always been a huge influence on me, especially with the John Wick series. To have the opportunity to develop a John Wick anime seems to be the perfect progression for the John Wick world. I feel John Wick is the perfect property for this medium — anime holds the potential to expand our world, our characters, and our action in ways unimaginable before.”\nIt’s a massively busy time for the billion dollar John Wick franchise. In addition to the already released four mainline films and the just-announced John Wick 5, the John Wick Universe includes two spinoff films (Ballerina, to be released June 6, and a spinoff directed by and starring Donnie Yen reprising his Caine character, set to start production this summer).\nIn addition, Lionsgate Television produced The Continental: From the World of John Wick for Peacock and Amazon Prime, and Lionsgate confirmed it’s developing the series John Wick: Under the High Table, which Stahelski and Keanu Reeves are executive producing.\nOutside TV and films, Lionsgate recently opened an immersive John Wick experience in Las Vegas and has a John Wick AAA video game in the works.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
